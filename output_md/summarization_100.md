Painted in 1953 it portrays Picardo in an informal pose at the age of 34. It was donated to the academy by his sons in 2023. Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura. In 2001 Picardo won the prestigious Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura (Antonio Camuñas Prize for Architecture). The prize has been awarded every two years since 1985. Its purpose is to recognise the oeuvre of a Spanish architect who has stood out in his or her work for architectural renovation. The prize jury praised Picardo, the ninth winner, as an architect "knowledgeable about our culture ... who has quietly exercised his professional activity, reinterpreting and valuing the richness of our historical heritage." Personal life. Picardo married Trinidad de Ribera Talavera and they had five children: three boys and two girls.In a rare public description of Picardo's personality a US travel journalist wrote of him in 1972 as "a package of energy, wit and imagination ... eyes twinkling".Picardo died on 27 July 2010 in Madrid. Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of Cádiz in Andalucía, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castellón. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Dirección General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucción nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing — in particular his mastery of perspective — drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine Fígaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Boletín de la Dirección General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing "increasing sophistication" and being of "complexity and extraordinary quality". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an "outstanding" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of “the most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and "sought inspiration in the design" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andalucía for "a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career. Robert Picardo, born in Spain in 1919, pursued architecture after his initial plans to join the navy and study law were disrupted. He trained under architect Luis Moya Blanco during the Spanish Civil War and began his career by painting murals and illustrating architectural magazines. Known for his mastery of perspective, Picardo's work showed increasing sophistication and complexity. After qualifying in 1951, he collaborated on building preservation and restoration projects with architect Fernando Chueca Goitia. Inspired by the Alhambra in Granada, Picardo was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" in 1952, which aimed to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture. The text is about a Spanish architect, Picardo, who won the Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura in 2001 for his contributions to architectural renovation. The prize, awarded every two years since 1985, honors an architect who has made significant strides in preserving Spain's historical heritage. Picardo, the ninth winner, was praised for his knowledge of Spanish culture and his quiet, yet impactful, professional activity. He was married to Trinidad de Ribera Talavera and had five children. A US travel journalist described him as "a package of energy, wit, and imagination" with twinkling eyes. Picardo passed away in Madrid on July 27, 2010. In 1953, his sons donated a portrait of him, painted at the age of 34, to the academy.

José Luis Picardo was an acclaimed muralist and illustrator, particularly known for his detailed architectural drawings. His work was highly regarded by leading Spanish restoration architects, including Leopoldo Torres Balbás and Luis Menéndez-Pidal y Álvarez. In 1959, Picardo was commissioned to design a pack of baraja de naipes for the Spanish fashion brand Loewe, which are now collectors' items. He also created a set of wooden chess pieces in 1960.

Picardo was recognized by the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) with the publication of a book of his drawings in 1960. From the early 1960s to 1985, he dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de España, where he worked on the restoration and construction of historical buildings, creating luxurious modern hotels that maintained and embellished the monuments' ancient appearance. His work for Paradores is highly regarded by other professionals and hotel guests. Picardo was regarded as an "outstanding" muralist.At the same time his drawings of buildings and architectural details were published as illustrations in a best-selling textbook on monumental and historic Spanish architecture, Arquitectura Popular Española, by the restoration and conservation architect Leopoldo Torres Balbás. Picardo travelled around Spain with him, making a multitude of detailed drawings of vernacular architectural elements for Balbás' books.. Picardo's published architectural drawings were highly regarded. They were described as "magnificent" by the leading Spanish restoration architect Luis Menéndez-Pidal y Álvarez.In 1959 Picardo was given an unusual commission: to design a pack of baraja de naipes (playing cards) for exclusive use as advertising material by the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces' types. It is dated to 1960.Around 1960 Picardo was rewarded by the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) for the many illustrations he had provided for the DGA's Boletín since he was a student with the publication of a small book, Dibujos de José Luis Picardo (Drawings of José Luis Picardo). More than 60 drawings appear in the book, both illustrations and humorous cartoons, and the foreword compares Picardo's work to illustrators such as the Romanian-American Saul Steinberg and in Britain Osbert Lancaster and Hugh Casson. The book is long out of print and virtually unknown in Spain, and not at all elsewhere, but is available second-hand. Paradores de Turismo. From the early 1960s to 1985 Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de España. He had for some time carried out minor work for the Ministerio de Información y Turismo which controlled the hotel network. For the purposes of tourism the Ministry and its forebears had for over 30 years rehabilitated rundown and sometimes ruined historic buildings such as castles and convents and converted them into luxury hotels in a style that went beyond ordinary hotel use. In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required.. A wealth of Picardo's drawings for his Paradores projects survive. There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbarán. Robert Picardo, born in Spain in 1919, pursued architecture after his initial plans to join the navy and study law were disrupted. He trained under architect Luis Moya Blanco during the Spanish Civil War and began his career by painting murals and illustrating architectural magazines. Known for his mastery of perspective, Picardo's work showed increasing sophistication and complexity.

He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Jaén: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Jaén in Andalucía. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hostería with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hostería, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafetería and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Jaén was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve "una sensación espacial espectacular" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hostería and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. In the 1960s, architect Picardo was commissioned to design a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén, Andalucía, which was built on a former Moorish fortress. The new wing, built in a simple hostería style, increased the number of guest rooms to 41, but its location on a steep hill and addition to the original design resulted in a complicated layout with many staircases and lifts. Picardo used stone, brick, timber, and iron to clad the building, giving the appearance of age and hiding the modern supporting structure. He also incorporated medieval elements in the interior design and used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior. The building was later extended in 1969 and 1973, adding service rooms and 24 more guest rooms, bringing the total to 43. The extension elongated the building, resulting in long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. The building was renamed Parador after the extension was completed and inaugurated in 1978. The castle in Alcañiz, originally a military palace, was in disrepair but declared a National Monument in 1925. When Picardo was hired to renovate it into a Parador, he faced limited space and could only create 12 guest rooms. He converted the ground floor's entrance into a reception area and the old stables into a bar and cafetería. The main dining room was situated on the first floor, and guest rooms were on the second floor with raised areas for window viewing. Picardo focused on medieval design for the ground floor and a more palatial look for the upper floors. He also incorporated his characteristic ceramic murals and the emblem of the Order of Calatrava in the decoration. In 1975, Picardo designed a two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998, bringing the total to 38.

Picardo was also commissioned to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alcúescar in Cáceres, a medieval fortified residence with later Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque elements. He focused on converting a jumble of old buildings, mostly stables and coach houses, into a Hostería. Picardo demolished most of the service buildings, keeping a square structure with substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. He used many architectural elements from the demolished buildings in the new construction and made the lower ground floor of the kept building the bar and cafetería, with a doorway from the street as the main entrance to the Hostería. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andalucían architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and Jáen, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects. He also used his typical ceramic tiles throughout the building, both for decoration and for explanatory texts.Picardo planned 18 guest rooms, but initially only 9 were built, some in the building facing the plaza, and the rest fronting the cliff-edge view. The latter benefitted from the same design of open wooden galleries Picardo had utilised at Jaén. The Parador opened to guests on 7 November 1966.Picardo returned to Arcos in 1974 to complete his original plan, building another floor on the part of the building overlooking the cliff, using the same design features, and increased the number of guest rooms to 18. The extension entered service in 1979. Hostería de Pedraza: Hostería Pintor Zuloaga. In 1965 Picardo was commissioned by Paradores to restore and rehabilitate the old Casa de la Inquisición (House of the Inquisition) in the small, historic village of Pedraza, 37 kilometres northeast of Segovia in  Castilla y León. It was to be a hostería - only a restaurant and a bar - without guest rooms.The three-storey property was mostly in ruins when Picardo surveyed it and was consequently not protected by conservation laws. He was therefore free to carry out his renovation as he saw fit, building on the medieval and rural ambience of the village. On the exterior he rearranged and improved the windows, preserved the surviving coat of arms above the front door, and at the rear added what was becoming his signature open wooden gallery on the top floor. Inside, Picardo followed the rustic style of the region's inns, building a spacious lounge behind the entrance hall, with a large and low fireplace, and on the upper floors the bar and the 90-seat dining-room opening onto the balcony-gallery.Once again, Picardo designed his own furniture and other fittings, the lighting and decoration, following the local style.. The hostería - named "Pintor Zuloaga" - opened to the public on 14 December 1967.At the same time Picardo raised the idea of expanding the property by purchasing neighbouring buildings. He had been concerned that the Hostería had restricted views, and felt that an extension could be designed with extensive views of the Sierra de Guadarrama to the south. His plans offered the prospect of 16 guest rooms and in November 1969 the proposal to convert the Hostería into a Parador was made public. However, difficulties in purchasing the neighbouring property made the project impossible.The Pedraza Hostería continued in operation until 15 December 1992 when economic pressures on the Parador chain caused its closure. Parador de Alcañiz: La Concordia. In 1966 Picardo began the conversion into a Parador of the Palacio de los Comendadores at Alcañiz in the province of Teruel in Aragon. The palace - the façade of which was remodelled in late-Renaissance style in 1728 - stood as the most prominent additional part of the Castillo de los Calatravos (Castle of the Calatravos), a monastery-fortress built in 1179. The oldest parts of the structure, a keep, a church and a cloister, date to the 12th and 13th centuries.The section of the property set aside for Picardo's conversion was the immense south wing, which was flanked by two towers and divided into three floors, the ground floor built of ashlar and the upper two floors of brick. There were balconies on the first floor, and on the uppermost floor a characteristic Aragonese long gallery had been developed, created by a succession of semi-circular arches. The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms. His plan for the public areas included the conversion of two large and long ground floor interiors, with pointed barrel-vaulted ceilings, on each side of the building's entrance.

Wide gaps have been closed and additions have been demolished, trying to restore the medieval character of the exterior." He goes on to say the work was completed in 1976 and that he, Don José Luis Picardo, was the architect.The Parador opened to the public on 20 July 1976 and the first stage of building work was finished in November of that year. It was inaugurated by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía in April 1978. Sigüenza was to be Picardo's last major project for the Paradores.. Remodelling and modernisation of the Parador took place in 1990 under the direction of the architect Carlos Fernández-Cuenca Gómez who scrupulously followed Picardo's style. Despite these further works, the Parador has kept its original character as established by Picardo. Most of the improvements have been only to modernise the services and facilities. Other Parador projects. In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of Mérida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monzón, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Cataluña and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Cataluña.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Antón at A Coruña in 1968, the Posada del Cordón at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del Deán and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of Cáceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia. Also in 1971 Picardo inspected the castle at Molina de Aragón in the province of Guadalajara, and possibly also in 1971 the Castillo de Valderrobres in Teruel in Aragon. In 1972 he surveyed the castle at Trujillo in the Province of Cáceres in Extremadura, the cave houses of Mesón Gitano (now known as the yacimiento arqueológico Barrio Almohadí (archeological site Barrio Almohadí) and the nearby Alcazaba of Almería, and the castle-fortress at Aracena in the Province of Huelva in Andalucía. In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y León. Controversial legacy of Picardo's Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbarán. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of Cáceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gramática, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Catálogo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de interés nacional histórico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an "outstanding" staircase, and to return them to their original Mudéjar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mudéjar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Jaén: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Jaén in Andalucía. The text discusses the work of architect Don José Luis Picardo on the Parador in Sigüenza, Spain. Picardo aimed to restore the medieval character of the exterior, and his work was completed in 1976. Further remodeling and modernization took place in 1990, but the Parador retained its original character. Picardo also worked on investigating and proposing plans for converting other old buildings into Paradores, although not all of these projects came to fruition during his lifetime. The text notes that rehabilitation projects during this time period, including Picardo's, were often carried out without archaeological research. Instead, they were planned based on historical and architectural research. Architect Picardo is known for his skilled restoration and construction of historical buildings for Paradores de Turismo in Spain, with his work influencing Portuguese architects as well. His first project, the Parador de Guadalupe, involved converting two ancient buildings into a hotel while preserving their original Mudéjar style. He used ancient construction techniques and incorporated decorative elements such as clay tile flooring and decorative wall tiles. The hotel opened in 1965 and Picardo was later invited back to add a new wing. He also designed a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén.

The text discusses several architectural projects by Picardo. The first project is a building in Arcos with dining and sitting rooms overlooking a river, featuring Andalucían architectural elements and ceramic tiles. Initially, 9 of the planned 18 guest rooms were built, with an extension added in 1974. The second project is a hosteria in Pedraza, converted from the Casa de la Inquisición, which only contains a restaurant and bar. Picardo renovated the exterior and interior, adding his signature open wooden gallery and rustic-style furniture. He also planned to expand the property with neighboring buildings, but the project was not realized. The third project is the conversion of the Palacio de los Comendadores in Alcañiz into a Parador, which involved renovating the oldest parts of the castle and adding 12 guest rooms. Picardo had to work within the limitations of the available space and the existing structure. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbarán. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of Cáceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gramática, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Catálogo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de interés nacional histórico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an "outstanding" staircase, and to return them to their original Mudéjar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mudéjar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Jaén: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Jaén in Andalucía. Architect Picardo is known for his skilled restoration and construction of historical buildings for Paradores de Turismo in Spain, with his work influencing Portuguese architects as well. His first project, the Parador de Guadalupe, involved converting two ancient buildings into a hotel while preserving their original Mudéjar style. He used ancient construction techniques and incorporated decorative elements such as clay tile flooring and decorative wall tiles. The hotel opened in 1965 and Picardo was later invited back to add a new wing. He also designed a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén. In 1978, an extension designed by Picardo added 24 guest rooms to the Jaén Parador, a hotel in Spain, raising the total to 43. The extension's design was constrained by the land's layout and building height limits, resulting in long corridors and distances between areas. Picardo also designed the interior, creating medieval-style furniture, decorations, and tile patterns, using coats of arms and ceramic tiles to share the building's history and credit those involved. The architecture and design approach was later used in other Paradores projects.

The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, located in Andalucía, was built on a triangular site overlooking the Rio Guadalete. Picardo preserved the façades of buildings facing the Plaza de España and the castle while demolishing the rest, keeping seven 2.35-meter columns for reuse. A 15-centimeter crack from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake led to the construction of an independent patio deck. The building, featuring Andalucían architectural elements, has an entrance hallway, a patio, and terracing with seven columns. Picardo designed the interior furniture, fittings, lighting, and decoration, using ceramic tiles for both design and explanatory texts. Initially, only nine of the planned 18 guest rooms were built.



## question

All of historians speak highly of Picardo's work, is this true? Why?

## ground_truth

False, because some people believe that Parrado destroyed the part of historical and architectural.

## generated_answer

Yes, historians speak highly of Picardo's work because of his mastery of perspective, his dedication to historical architecture preservation, his innovative designs, and his influence on other architects in Spain and Portugal.

Picardo was regarded as an "outstanding" muralist.At the same time his drawings of buildings and architectural details were published as illustrations in a best-selling textbook on monumental and historic Spanish architecture, Arquitectura Popular Española, by the restoration and conservation architect Leopoldo Torres Balbás. Picardo travelled around Spain with him, making a multitude of detailed drawings of vernacular architectural elements for Balbás' books.. Picardo's published architectural drawings were highly regarded. They were described as "magnificent" by the leading Spanish restoration architect Luis Menéndez-Pidal y Álvarez.In 1959 Picardo was given an unusual commission: to design a pack of baraja de naipes (playing cards) for exclusive use as advertising material by the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces' types. It is dated to 1960.Around 1960 Picardo was rewarded by the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) for the many illustrations he had provided for the DGA's Boletín since he was a student with the publication of a small book, Dibujos de José Luis Picardo (Drawings of José Luis Picardo). More than 60 drawings appear in the book, both illustrations and humorous cartoons, and the foreword compares Picardo's work to illustrators such as the Romanian-American Saul Steinberg and in Britain Osbert Lancaster and Hugh Casson. The book is long out of print and virtually unknown in Spain, and not at all elsewhere, but is available second-hand. Paradores de Turismo. From the early 1960s to 1985 Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de España. He had for some time carried out minor work for the Ministerio de Información y Turismo which controlled the hotel network. For the purposes of tourism the Ministry and its forebears had for over 30 years rehabilitated rundown and sometimes ruined historic buildings such as castles and convents and converted them into luxury hotels in a style that went beyond ordinary hotel use. In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required.. A wealth of Picardo's drawings for his Paradores projects survive. There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbarán. Robert Picardo, born in Spain in 1919, pursued architecture after his initial plans to join the navy and study law were disrupted. He trained under architect Luis Moya Blanco during the Spanish Civil War and began his career by painting murals and illustrating architectural magazines. Known for his mastery of perspective, Picardo's work showed increasing sophistication and complexity. After qualifying in 1951, he collaborated on building preservation and restoration projects with architect Fernando Chueca Goitia. Inspired by the Alhambra in Granada, Picardo was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" in 1952, which aimed to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture. Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of Cádiz in Andalucía, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castellón. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Dirección General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucción nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing — in particular his mastery of perspective — drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine Fígaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Boletín de la Dirección General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing "increasing sophistication" and being of "complexity and extraordinary quality". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an "outstanding" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of “the most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and "sought inspiration in the design" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andalucía for "a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career. Picardo was a renowned architect known for his restoration and modern building projects. He worked on several historic sites, including the Catedral de Cádiz, Real Monasterio de Santa María de Guadalupe, and Catedral de Santa María de Sigüenza. His designs combined classical and contemporary styles, as seen in his award-winning Fundación Juan March building in Madrid. Completed in 1975, this project features a simple, elegant design with alternating ribbon windows and marble cladding. The building houses various facilities, such as assembly halls, libraries, offices, and underground parking. Picardo also integrated artwork into the architecture and designed a garden for the property. The project received critical acclaim, with observers praising its proportions and spatial arrangement. Picardo considered this building his best work.

Barcelona has 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods. The district of Ciutat Vella, the oldest part of the city, has the lowest socioeconomic level population and is the main tourist attraction due to its numerous monuments and ancient architecture. Eixample, which was built during the expansion of the old city, is a densely populated district and is known for its modernist architectural works and commercial activity. Sants-Montjuïc, the largest district, has a low population density, high percentage of green area, and includes the Montjuïc mountain and Zona Franca. Les Corts, originally an agricultural area, has a high rate of young people and middle class population, and is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, one of the largest districts, has the lowest population density and is a high status residential area with a predominance of single-family houses. Gràcia, with its high population density, has a high percentage of elderly people and lower-middle class population. Horta-Guinardó, originally an agricultural area and summer residences, has a low population density, young and lower-middle class population. Administrative divisions. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km², 100 685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old core of the city, the one derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus the Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the eighteenth century. This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Being the oldest part of the city, it has numerous monuments and architectural works of interest, making it an important focus of tourist attraction. On the other hand, it houses the most important institutions of the city, such as the City Hall or the Generalitat de Catalunya.. Eixample (7.46 km², 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerdá Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerdà. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands.. Sants-Montjuïc (21.35 km², 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montjuïc mountain, which makes it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. It has a low population density, and its rate of population of foreign origin exceeds the average. It has a high percentage of green area, thanks mainly to the presence of the Montjuic mountain, as well as industrial land.. Les Corts (6.08 km², 81,200 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarrià, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval masia. It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-nineteenth century experienced a significant urban growth with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. The population is mainly autochthonous, and stands out for its high rate of young people. The majority is middle class, although the Pedralbes neighborhood stands out as one of the most exclusive in the city. Its main economic activity is in the tertiary sector, and it is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers.. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km², 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarrià and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Collserola mountain range. It is also the district with the lowest population density, mainly because it is a high status residential area, with a predominance of single-family houses. The economy is dominated by quality facilities, as well as private schools and health centers. Its population has the highest rate of higher education and technical and managerial professionals, as well as autochthonous residents, while the foreign population is dominated by the European Union.. Gràcia (4.19 km², 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gràcia, incorporated into the city in 1897. It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinardó (11.96 km², 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinardó district, formerly belonging to Sant Martí de Provençals, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. The text describes four districts in Barcelona, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Horta-Guinardó, the oldest of the four, was once an agricultural area that became urbanized and industrialized in the early 1800s. It has a high population density and a large elderly population, with most residents being of lower-middle class. Nou Barris, the most recently created district, is located on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar and has a majority immigrant population that has suffered from real estate speculation and lack of assistance. Sant Andreu, which was once an agricultural and milling area, experienced industrialization in the mid-1800s and later received a wave of immigrant population. Sant Martí, another district that was once agricultural, underwent deindustrialization in recent decades and has seen an influx of new technology-based economic activities.

Historically, Barcelona's administrative division has changed over time. The city was first divided into four quarters in 1389, with a grid system that separated the northern and southern quarters along the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This division highlighted the social differences between the different parts of the city. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, and in 1769, the city was reformed to create five quarters, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century for political reasons. It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinardó (11.96 km², 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinardó district, formerly belonging to Sant Martí de Provençals, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. During the years of massive immigration, it was an area of strong real estate speculation.. Nou Barris (8.04 km², 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar. It is a peripheral area with a majority immigrant population, which also suffered from strong real estate speculation and even suffered from shantyism and self-construction, and which for a long time has suffered from a significant lack of assistance, infrastructure and basic services, which have been mitigated in recent times. The majority of the population is working class and has low purchasing power.. Sant Andreu (6.56 km², 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of Sant Andreu de Palomar, annexed in 1897. It was an agricultural and milling area until the mid-nineteenth century, when numerous industries began to settle. On the other hand, in the mid-twentieth century it received a strong wave of immigration, which was received in neighborhoods of cheap houses and residential estates, such as the Bon Pastor and Baró de Viver. In recent times it has experienced a certain revitalization thanks to commercial activities such as the location of the La Maquinista center or the urbanization of the surroundings of La Sagrera Station to accommodate the arrival of the AVE high-speed train.. Sant Martí (10.80 km², 232,629 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Sant Martí de Provençals, added in 1897. Like the previous one, it was an agricultural and milling area, until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution when numerous factories were installed in the area; however, in recent decades it has suffered a process of deindustrialization, replaced by economic activities more based on new technologies, especially after the location of the so-called 22@ district. This district also welcomed a large immigrant population. Thanks to the 1992 Olympic Games, it underwent a process of renovation of the entire waterfront, where the Olympic Village was located. Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Plaça del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts.

Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km², 100 685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old core of the city, the one derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus the Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the eighteenth century. This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Being the oldest part of the city, it has numerous monuments and architectural works of interest, making it an important focus of tourist attraction. On the other hand, it houses the most important institutions of the city, such as the City Hall or the Generalitat de Catalunya.. Eixample (7.46 km², 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerdá Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerdà. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands.. Sants-Montjuïc (21.35 km², 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montjuïc mountain, which makes it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. It has a low population density, and its rate of population of foreign origin exceeds the average. It has a high percentage of green area, thanks mainly to the presence of the Montjuic mountain, as well as industrial land.. Les Corts (6.08 km², 81,200 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarrià, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval masia. It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-nineteenth century experienced a significant urban growth with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. The population is mainly autochthonous, and stands out for its high rate of young people. The majority is middle class, although the Pedralbes neighborhood stands out as one of the most exclusive in the city. Its main economic activity is in the tertiary sector, and it is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers.. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km², 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarrià and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Collserola mountain range. It is also the district with the lowest population density, mainly because it is a high status residential area, with a predominance of single-family houses. The economy is dominated by quality facilities, as well as private schools and health centers. Its population has the highest rate of higher education and technical and managerial professionals, as well as autochthonous residents, while the foreign population is dominated by the European Union.. Gràcia (4.19 km², 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gràcia, incorporated into the city in 1897. It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinardó (11.96 km², 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinardó district, formerly belonging to Sant Martí de Provençals, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. The 21st century has seen significant urban renewal in Barcelona, with a focus on new technology companies and the regeneration of areas like the Poblenou neighborhood and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to the recovery of the Besòs area and the creation of new parks and leisure spaces. The urban planning of the new millennium has reinforced the grid structure, leading to the emergence of new urban centers and the improvement of communications, including the high-speed train, expanded port and airport, and an automated metro network. Pedestrian transit has been facilitated through elevators and escalators, and new green spaces have been created, such as the Central Park of Nou Barris and the Diagonal Mar Park. In 2015, the drafting of a new Urban Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona began, with objectives including classifying metropolitan land, establishing building regulations, and defining areas for sustainable development.

In the late 18th century, the Paseo Nuevo was created and the Born and Boqueria markets were established. The 19th century saw significant economic revitalization, particularly in the textile industry, leading to a Catalan cultural renaissance. The city walls were demolished between 1854 and 1859, allowing for urban expansion under the Eixample project. The Citadel was also demolished and transformed into a public park. Industrialization, led by the Bonaplata Factory and La España Industrial, brought about urban planning changes, including the regulation of building and public space maintenance. The first Municipal Ordinances were approved in 1856, and new ones were drawn up in 1891 to accommodate the Eixample plan. Key urban planning actions included the opening of Calle de Fernando and the expansion of the Pla de Palau. Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area. In this period there was a notable demographic increase, and the economy was progressively industrialized, until it led to the so-called Industrial Revolution.. The arrival of the Bourbons generated a series of military engineering works, such as the castle of Montjuïc and the fortress of the Citadel. For the construction of the Citadel (1715-1751), 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood were demolished, leaving 4500 people homeless and without compensation, and the Rec Comtal was diverted. The work of Jorge Próspero de Verboom, it was a pentagonal walled bastion, with a protective moat and an esplanade of 120 m between the walls and the surrounding buildings. Demolished in the Revolution of 1868, on its perimeter was installed the park of the Citadel.There were also two new military roads that crossed the plain of Barcelona: the Mataró road —coincident with the current Pere IV street— and the Creu Coberta road, which connected with the Madrid road —current streets of Hostafrancs and Sants—.In 1753, the construction of the neighborhood of La Barceloneta began at the initiative of the Marquis of La Mina. Located on a small peninsula of land reclaimed from the sea, its layout was designed by the engineer Pedro Martín Cermeño, with a grid of orthogonal streets and blocks of houses of elongated plan, which is a clear example of academic baroque urbanism. In this neighborhood was located in 1772 the Clock Tower, the first lighthouse of the city; it was followed by the Llobregat in 1845 and Montjuïc in 1925.In 1771, the Edicto de obreria was approved, a municipal ordinance aimed at controlling private works in the city, which involved the regulation of the alignment of houses according to the layout of the streets, as well as the supervision of aspects such as the paving of the streets, the sewage system, the numbering of houses, etc. This edict established for the first time the obligation to request a building permit, accompanied by a report and the payment of the respective fees. Likewise, in 1797 a height limit was established for all buildings. During this century there was a change in the typology of private buildings, which went from the "artisan house" of the medieval type to the "multi-family house" with a collective staircase, which definitively separated work from residence.. Between 1776 and 1778 the redevelopment of La Rambla was carried out, an ancient torrent that during the Middle Ages marked the western boundary of the city, which had been populated since the 16th century, mainly by theaters and convents. At this time the inner wall was demolished, the buildings were realigned and a new landscaped promenade, in the style of the French boulevard, was designed. The paseos of Sant Joan and Gràcia were also planned, although they were not built until the turn of the century for the former and 1820-1827 for the latter. Likewise, the street of the Count of the Assault —currently New Street of La Rambla— (1778-1789) was laid out, named after Francisco González de Bassecourt, captain general of Catalonia, who had the initiative to create the street. In 1797 the Paseo Nuevo or Paseo de la Explanada was also created, located next to the military Citadel, a wide avenue lined with poplars and elms and decorated with ornamental fountains, which for a time was the main green space of the city, but disappeared in the urbanization works of the park of the Citadel.During the eighteenth century, the Born and Boqueria markets were established as the only two general supply markets, and in 1752 aspects such as weights and measures for the marketing of food products, in addition to coal, were regulated. 19th Century. In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked primarily to the textile industry, which in turn led to a Catalan cultural renaissance. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for "suburb"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Calçats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea. The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km². The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'Àngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montjuïc; those of Martorell and Castellví de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Eramprunyà (Gavà) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Besòs river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the "artisan type", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10–12 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent —later City Hall— or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital —such as the Santa Creu— or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the Bòria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Plaça Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Lluís Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara —in the current Citadel Park—, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marquès del l'Argentera. Currently only the Portal de Santa Madrona, in the Drassanes, is still preserved.With the extension of the wall, a long avenue known as La Rambla, occupied mainly by religious institutions, was left within the city walls. It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Llàtzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc. These gardens disappeared a few years later with the urbanization of Passeig de Gràcia. Expansion of Barcelona (Eixample). In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir ¡Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerdà, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerdà Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliación, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Besòs, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Cerdà had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral·lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Glòries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat. It also foresaw the opening of three large avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular one that would connect the Citadel with Montjuic (avenida de la Catedral). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would circumvent the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universitat and Sant Pere.. Cerdá's project was quite innovative for the time, especially with regard to the delimitation of green spaces and service areas, taking into account both functional, recreational and welfare aspects. The buildings were to have a height of 16 meters (first floor and four floors), and a depth of 10 to 20 meters. The distribution of the Eixample was to be in sectors of 20 x 20 blocks, divided into districts of 10 x 10 and neighborhoods of 5 x 5. Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park. It also had industrial and administrative facilities, and in the suburbs there was a slaughterhouse, a cemetery and three hospitals.

The text describes four districts in Barcelona, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Horta-Guinardó, the oldest of the four, was once an agricultural area that became urbanized and industrialized in the early 1800s. It has a high population density and a large elderly population, with most residents being of lower-middle class. Nou Barris, the most recently created district, is located on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar and has a majority immigrant population that has suffered from real estate speculation and lack of assistance. Sant Andreu, which was once an agricultural and milling area, experienced industrialization in the mid-1800s and later received a wave of immigrant population. Sant Martí, another district that was once agricultural, underwent deindustrialization in recent decades and has seen an influx of new technology-based economic activities.

Historically, Barcelona's administrative division has changed over time. The city was first divided into four quarters in 1389, with a grid system that separated the northern and southern quarters along the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This division highlighted the social differences between the different parts of the city. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, and in 1769, the city was reformed to create five quarters, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century for political reasons. The Middle Ages marked the reuse and preservation of Roman Barcelona's urban structure as a military stronghold and county seat. The city became a significant maritime and commercial hub of the Mediterranean Sea, being part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona's growth led to the establishment of the Council of One Hundred for city administration, covering Montcada to Molins de Rei and Castelldefels to Montgat. The city had a Jewish quarter, the Call, from 692 until its destruction in 1391. Agricultural development occurred outside the city walls, and new neighborhoods formed around churches and monasteries, leading to a new wall construction in 1260. The 21st century has seen significant urban renewal in Barcelona, with a focus on new technology companies and the regeneration of areas like the Poblenou neighborhood and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to the recovery of the Besòs area and the creation of new parks and leisure spaces.

Barcelona has undergone several administrative divisions throughout its history. In the 15th century, it was divided into two quarters, which increased to five in the 18th century. The 19th century saw numerous divisions for political reasons, with the city divided into four districts in 1837 and ten in 1878. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, neighboring municipalities were added, and the city was reorganized into ten districts. In 1933, two more districts were added, and in 1984, the current division into ten districts was approved to decentralize the City Council. The last reform in 2006 established 73 neighborhoods, causing controversy due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods. Barcelona's history dates back to the 1st century BC when it was founded as Barcino by Roman colonizers.

Barcelona's urbanization was completed in 1444, with a wide space used for strolling and markets. The city's growth was limited in the Early Modern Age (15-18th centuries) due to becoming part of the Hispanic Monarchy, experiencing periods of prosperity and crisis. The city's walls remained unchanged, except for the addition of bastions. A port was built in the 15th century to accommodate maritime trade, and the seafront was later embanked. The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession. Barcelona has undergone several administrative divisions throughout its history.

Barcelona's history dates back to the 1st century BC when it was founded as Barcino by Roman colonizers. The text outlines the creation of 73 neighborhoods in Barcelona, which was a controversial process due to the division of some historical neighborhoods. The city has a long history, beginning with its founding by Roman colonizers as Barcino on a small hill near the coast with a natural harbor. The Romans built a walled city with a grid layout that would shape the city's future design. The city was a military stronghold and an important commercial center during the Middle Ages, becoming the capital of the Catalan counties and an influential maritime power in the Mediterranean. The Roman period left behind architectural elements such as walls, towers, a necropolis, and aqueducts, which have been preserved. The city's growth and development continued through various historical periods, with the Roman urban structure serving as the foundation for future growth.

In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban expansion due to population growth and poor health conditions caused by high population density within the city walls. After much public outcry, the walls were finally demolished in 1854, allowing for the city's territorial expansion. A competition was held for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias, but ultimately overruled in favor of Ildefons Cerdà's innovative plan. Cerdà's plan featured an orthogonal layout with wide streets, open spaces for gardens, and designated areas for public services and facilities. The buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan, and the distribution of the Eixample was divided into sectors, districts, and neighborhoods, each with their own designated public amenities. Although not all of Cerdà's plans were fully realized, his project had a significant impact on the development of Barcelona and was innovative for its time, particularly in its consideration of green spaces and service areas. The Cerdà Plan, proposed in the mid-19th century, aimed to expand Barcelona with 16-meter tall buildings arranged in 20x20 block sectors, divided into districts and neighborhoods with specific facilities. The expansion was to be accompanied by better hygiene, circulation, and multipurpose design. However, due to opposition and real estate speculation, many of these plans were not realized. The city's interior also needed modernization, leading to plans like those of Miquel Garriga i Roca and Àngel Baixeras, which focused on realigning streets and creating major thoroughfares in the old city center. The growth of Barcelona's suburbs in the post-war period led to the concept of "Great Barcelona," with neighboring municipalities experiencing significant expansion due to real estate speculation, facilitated by the 1942 Municipal Ordinances reform. In 1945, Pedro Bidagor initiated the Regional Plan of 1953 to integrate the city and surroundings, addressing housing demand and speculation, and improving the urban environment. The Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956 aimed to rationalize urban development, while the Regional Plan zoned areas for growth, infrastructure, facilities, and green spaces, like the Collserola mountain range park.

Despite not being fully implemented, partial plans emerged, often catering to landowners' interests and increasing population density. New neighborhoods led to the construction of new markets and the improvement of the city's road network, including Meridiana Avenue, the First and Second Ring Roads, subway parking lots, and the 1962 arterial network project. Porcioles created the Municipal Housing Board, whose developments included the creation of large housing estates, such as Montbau (1958-1961), Southwest Besòs (1959-1960) and Canyelles (1974). Some of the urban development actions of this period were positive, such as the covering of Aragón street, the extension of the Gran Vía towards the Maresme, the adaptation of the seafront of Montjuic or the Barceloneta promenade; however, the speculative rampage of large real estate operations generated popular discontent that resulted in the so-called "urban social movements", which combined the discomfort generated by the degradation of the urban periphery with political protest against the Franco regime. Examples of this were the opposition to the new layout of Lesseps square caused by the opening of the First Ring Road (Ronda del Mig), or the reaction against the Partial Plan of Vallbona, Torre Baró and Trinitat, organized by a neighborhood association called Nueve Barrios (Nine Neighbourhoods) which later gave rise to the name of that new district of the city.. Despite the rise of developmentalism, there were some attempts at urban reorganization, such as the Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1966), which sought to make profitability and urban construction compatible, although its guiding character did not lead to practical realization; and the so-called Plan Barcelona 2000 (1970), a somewhat utopian attempt to establish criteria for the future city, where the importance given to infrastructure predominates, while a realistic commitment was made to the disorderly nature of urban growth. In the same 1970 a project for a Universal Exposition in 1982 emerged, which foresaw the opening of large avenues in the city, among them a vertical axis that would link Plaza de España with Vallès through the Vallvidrera tunnel, and a Gran Vía Norte formed with Josep Tarradellas street and the Travessera de Gràcia extended to Santa Coloma; all this was not finally realized. In 1969 the Vilalta Plan for the construction of treatment plants for the treatment of the city's wastewater was also approved.Between 1964 and 1972 the Plan de la Ribera was developed, aimed at the urbanization of the city's eastern seafront, from Barceloneta to Besòs, an area of 225 ha. Prepared by Antoni Bonet i Castellana, it was based on the deindustrialization of the area, and proposed the creation of a megastructure of seven large blocks of 500 x 500 m of luxury housing. The project had a long administrative process, and was not included in the Regional Plan until 1970. However, in 1972 the Town Planning Department of the City Council requested a redrafting of the project, due to opposition from neighbors and professional associations, who denounced the speculation attempts of the companies that financed the project, so it was definitively paralyzed. However, over time the plan was recognized as an attempt to renew Barcelona's urban planning, in line with international trends such as urban renewal or renovation urbaine, and the renovation of the coast remained in the collective imagination, which was finally carried out on the occasion of the Olympic Games.Finally, during the dictatorship the actions in green spaces focused more on the maintenance and restoration of existing areas than on the creation of new spaces. In 1940 Lluís Riudor, the initiator of landscaping in Catalonia, was put in charge of Parks and Gardens. His actions included the Austria Garden —located in the Park Güell enclosure—, the Monterols Park, the Cervantes Park, and various interventions in the Montjuïc mountain aimed at eliminating shantytowns, a project continued by his successor, Joaquim Casamor, with the creation of several thematic gardens, such as the Mossèn Costa i Llobera gardens, specialized in cacti and succulents, and the Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer gardens, dedicated to aquatic, bulbous and rhizomatous plants. His work also included the Mirador del Alcalde and Joan Maragall gardens on Montjuic, located around the Albéniz Palacete; and, in the rest of Barcelona, the Putget, Guineueta and Villa Amelia parks. Democracy and the General Metropolitan Plan. The end of the dictatorship and the advent of democracy brought a new era in the architectural and urban planning panorama of the city, which was increasingly immersed in international avant-garde trends. The new socialist councils of Narcís Serra (1979-1982) and Pasqual Maragall (1982-1997) were committed to urban planning and architecture as the city's hallmarks, and initiated an extensive program of urban reforms that culminated with the 1992 Olympic Games.

Barcelona, the capital and largest city of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant on the Mediterranean coast, between 41°16' and 41°30' north latitude and 1°54' and 2°18' east longitude. The city is situated on a 102.16 km² plain, surrounded by the sea, the Collserola mountain range, and the deltas of the Besós and Llobregat rivers. Barcelona's climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and low rainfall. The city's terrain is hilly and was once covered in torrents and streams, which have since been replaced by built-up areas. Barcelona is the most significant urban center in Catalonia, serving as the seat of the autonomous government, the Parliament of Catalonia, and other important institutions. It is the second most populous city in Spain, with a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods, including the old core of the city and the Barceloneta neighborhood, which has seen significant immigration from both Spain and other countries. Geography and location. Barcelona, capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant, on the Mediterranean coast. Its geographical location is between 41°16' and 41°30' north latitude and between 1°54' and 2°18' east longitude. With an area of 102.16 km², it is situated on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Collserola mountain range —with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point—, as well as by the deltas of the Besós and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the mountain of Montjuïc (184.8 m). Also, from the Collserola mountain range, several hills that follow a line parallel to the coastal range rise up on the plain: the hills of La Peira (133 m), La Rovira (261 m), El Carmel (267 m), Creueta del Coll (249 m), El Putget (181 m) and Monterols (121 m).The plain of Barcelona is not uniform, but has several undulations caused by the many torrents that once crossed the land, and also has a uniform slope from the sea to the Collserola mountain range, with an ascent of about 260 m. It is crossed by several faults, mainly the one that separates the Collserola mountain range from the hills that come forward in the plain, with a northeast-southwest orientation, and the one that separates the mountain of Montjuic from the coast. The terrain is formed by a substrate of slate and granitic formations, as well as clays and limestones. The coast was formerly occupied by tidal marshes and salt-water lagoons, which disappeared as the coastline advanced thanks to the sediments provided by the rivers and streams that flowed into the beach; it is estimated that since the sixth century BC, the coastline has been able to advance about 5 km. The area of the plain was formerly crossed by numerous torrents and streams, which were grouped into three fluvial sectors: Horta stream in the area near the Besòs river (or eastern area); the Blanca stream and the Gornal torrent in the Llobregat area (or western area); and, in the central area of the plain, a group of streams coming from the southern slope of Tibidabo, such as the San Gervasi, Vallcarca, Magòria and Collserola streams.The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters thanks to the protection that the orography of the terrain offers to the plain, which is sheltered from the north winds. The temperature usually ranges between 9.5 °C and 24.3 °C, on average. Rainfall is low, about 600 mm per year, and most of the precipitation occurs in spring and autumn. This scarcity meant that in the past numerous works had to be carried out to supply water to the city, including wells, canals and irrigation ditches. The vegetation of the area consists mainly of pines and evergreen oaks, and undergrowth of heather, laurestine, arbutus and climbing plants. In the past, both rainfed and irrigated agriculture was practiced —mainly vineyards and cereals—, although nowadays almost the entire surface area is built up.Barcelona, capital of the Barcelonès region and of the province of Barcelona, is the most important urban center in Catalonia in demographic, political, economic and cultural terms. It is the seat of the autonomous government and the Parliament of Catalonia, as well as the provincial deputation, the archbishopric and the IV Military Region, and has a port, an airport and an important network of railroads and roads. With a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015, it is the second most populous city in Spain after Madrid, and the eleventh most populous in the European Union. Administrative divisions. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km², 100 685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old core of the city, the one derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus the Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the eighteenth century. This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Barcelona's urbanization was completed in 1444, with a wide space used for strolling and markets. The city's growth was limited in the Early Modern Age (15-18th centuries) due to becoming part of the Hispanic Monarchy, experiencing periods of prosperity and crisis. The city's walls remained unchanged, except for the addition of bastions. A port was built in the 15th century to accommodate maritime trade, and the seafront was later embanked. The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession. In 1925, Spain's telephone service was nationalized, leading to the creation of the Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. The number of telephones in Barcelona grew significantly from 2479 in 1897 to 850,000 in 2000. During the late 19th century, many supply markets were constructed, including those in Born, Sant Antoni, Hostafrancs, La Barceloneta, Concepción, Llibertat, Clot, Unió, Gràcia, and Sants. The 1888 Universal Exposition had a significant impact on the city, leading to improvements in infrastructure and modernization. The Citadel Park was remodeled, and the Salón de San Juan was renovated, featuring wrought iron balustrades, pavement mosaics, and large lampposts. Many of the buildings and pavilions constructed for the Exposition disappeared, but the Castle of the Three Dragons, the Martorell Museum, the Orangery, and the Umbraculum still remain. Numerous works and improvements were carried out throughout the city for the event, including the completion of the urbanization of the city's seafront, the beginning of the urbanization of Plaça de Catalunya, the covering of Riera d'en Malla, the beginning of Avenue of Paral·lel, and the extension of Passeig de Sant Joan. Additionally, Pere Garcia Fària's project to regulate the city's sewage system in 1891 established a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which is still in use today.

Barcelona's urbanization was completed in 1444, with a wide space used for strolling and markets. The city's growth was limited in the Early Modern Age (15-18th centuries) due to becoming part of the Hispanic Monarchy, experiencing periods of prosperity and crisis. The city's walls remained unchanged, except for the addition of bastions. A port was built in the 15th century to accommodate maritime trade, and the seafront was later embanked. The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession. The text outlines the creation of 73 neighborhoods in Barcelona, which was a controversial process due to the division of some historical neighborhoods. The city has a long history, beginning with its founding by Roman colonizers as Barcino on a small hill near the coast with a natural harbor. The Romans built a walled city with a grid layout that would shape the city's future design. The city was a military stronghold and an important commercial center during the Middle Ages, becoming the capital of the Catalan counties and an influential maritime power in the Mediterranean. The Roman period left behind architectural elements such as walls, towers, a necropolis, and aqueducts, which have been preserved. The city's growth and development continued through various historical periods, with the Roman urban structure serving as the foundation for future growth. Seventy-three neighborhoods were established, stipulated according to historical, cultural and social criteria, although the decision was not without controversy, mainly due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods defended as units by the neighborhood associations: thus, for example, from the neighborhood of El Clot was segregated El Camp de l'Arpa; from Sants was segregated the neighborhood of Badal; Esquerra de l'Eixample was divided between La Nova and L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample; and Poblenou was fragmented into five neighborhoods. Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvorí. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Plaça de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerdá in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Plaça de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Besós river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city —currently the Plaça Nova—.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire. This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The Middle Ages marked the reuse and preservation of Roman Barcelona's urban structure as a military stronghold and county seat. The city became a significant maritime and commercial hub of the Mediterranean Sea, being part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona's growth led to the establishment of the Council of One Hundred for city administration, covering Montcada to Molins de Rei and Castelldefels to Montgat. The city had a Jewish quarter, the Call, from 692 until its destruction in 1391. Agricultural development occurred outside the city walls, and new neighborhoods formed around churches and monasteries, leading to a new wall construction in 1260.

In the early 1900s, Barcelona underwent significant urban development. A new road was built with a uniform noucentista design, influenced by the Chicago School, despite criticism and building demolitions. Other urbanization projects included the development of Tibidabo's slopes, the Can Muntaner estate, and the expansion of the port. The city also saw the introduction of the Barcelona Traction Light and Power company, leading to general electrification and industrial growth. Public urinals and a tramway network were established, followed by the appearance of the first bus lines. However, these bus lines faced opposition from tramway companies and were suspended, only to reappear later as suburban lines. In 1908, the service was abolished due to opposition from tramway companies, but it reappeared in 1916 with suburban lines. City buses were reintroduced in 1922 by the Compañía General de Autobuses de Barcelona, which later merged with Tranvías de Barcelona. The first taxis were licensed in 1910, and their numbers reached 1000 by 1920. The 1920s saw the introduction of the Barcelona Metro, with two lines becoming operational in 1924 and 1926. The city's public schooling expanded significantly during the early 20th century, and the idea of green spaces was proposed in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí. The 1929 International Exposition was held in Montjuïc, leading to the urbanization of the area and the construction of pavilions. In the mid to late 1800s, there were several urban development projects in Barcelona. One of the first was by Miquel Garriga i Roca in 1862, which proposed realigning streets for a broad renovation of the city's interior. However, it was not executed due to difficulties and lack of expropriation mechanisms. Àngel Baixeras presented a more elaborate project in 1878, which included opening three major thoroughfares and was approved in 1879, but not executed until 1908. The tramway was introduced in 1860 and electrified in 1899. Street furniture also grew, especially during the appointment of Antoni Rovira i Trias and his successor Pere Falqués. Electric lighting began in the 1880s and was generalized by the beginning of the 20th century. The first telephone communication in the peninsula took place in Barcelona in 1877, and the number of telephones grew progressively throughout the century. Additionally, numerous supply markets were built, many made of iron. In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant developments in transportation, urban planning, and public services. The city became a railway hub with stations like Francia (1854), Sants (1854), and Norte (1862), forming a network in the shape of a "Catalan eight." The first fire and police services were established, with the Guardia Urbana de Barcelona (1843) and the Sociedad de Extinción de Incendios y Salvamento de Barcelona (1865). The Diputation of Barcelona improved road layouts, such as Sarrià road (now Sarrià Avenue), and the telegraph service began in 1855. Public parks, like the General's Garden (1816), were created due to the Industrial Revolution's urban growth and environmental challenges. A major event was the demolition of the city walls in the mid-19th century, which paved the way for urban expansion (Eixample).

Over several decades, French governments have attempted pension reforms to address budget shortfalls, as France has a low retirement age and spends a high percentage of GDP on pensions. The current system, based on mandatory payroll taxes funding retiree pensions, will not change. However, rising life expectancy has left the system precarious, with fewer workers supporting each retiree. Macron's proposed reforms include gradually raising the retirement age to 64 by 2030, increasing years of contributions for a full pension, and eliminating special rules for certain sectors. These reforms aim to balance the pension deficit by 2030, creating a surplus to cover early retirement for physically demanding jobs. Initial protests and strikes have occurred, and the government has signaled flexibility regarding the retirement age increase. Background. The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a "pay-as-you-go structure"; both workers and employers "are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions". This system, "which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change". Compared to other European countries, France possesses "one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty", with a net pension replacement rate ("a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  "have left the system in an increasingly precarious state"; "[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany. In an interview in March 2023, Macron said that "when he began working there were 10 million French pensioners and now there were 17 million". The New York Times add that in order "[t]o keep the system financially viable without funneling more taxpayer money into it – something the government already does – Macron sought to gradually raise the legal age when workers can start collecting a pension by three months every year until it reaches 64 in 2030." Additionally, Macron has "accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension ‌rules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation".As part of Macron's pension reforms, the retirement age was to be raised to 64 or 65, from 62.  The pay-as-you-go system –  raising the retirement age would help to further finance, as life expectancy increases and more start work later – would have a surplus of €3.2bn in 2022, but the government's pensions advisory board (COR) forecast that it would "fall into structural deficits in coming decades unless new financing sources are found". In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that "without immediate action" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would "balance the deficit" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would "pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another "plan to unify the complex French pension system" by "getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 – the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from.In his New Year's Eve speech on 31 December 2022, he clarified that the reforms would be implemented by autumn 2023. In early January 2023 prior to consultation with unions, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne spoke on FranceInfo radio, stating that the government could "show flexibility" on the intention to raise the retirement age to 65, and were willing to explore "other solutions" that would enable the government to "reach its target of balancing the pensions system by 2030". She announced that the policy would be presented to cabinet on 23 January and debated in parliament in early February, with full details published on 10 January. Use of Article 49.3. The left-wing coalition NUPES and some French deputies argue that a pension reform, included in the social security budget, is unconstitutional as it addresses more than just finances. They plan to use the Conseil d'État's warning to the government about the reform's potential unconstitutionality. In March, President Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms, and the state visit of King Charles III was postponed due to ongoing protests. The cancellation was met with mixed reactions in France, while international reactions included criticism from Iran and human rights organizations accusing French authorities of excessive force and violating protestors' rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities to protect peaceful demonstrations. Protests in France over Macron's proposed pension reforms have resulted in injuries to both protesters and police. The use of excessive force by authorities has been criticized by the Council of Europe. The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is similar to former President Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which led to widespread protests and influenced the 2012 presidential election. Invoking Article 49.3 could be perceived as brutal and erode support for the government and democratic institutions. Alternatives to the pension reforms include firing the Prime Minister, holding a referendum, or triggering a 'RIP' before the enactment of the law. However, these options have their own requirements and potential consequences. Macron has stated that he will not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. The planned state visit of King Charles III to France has been postponed due to the ongoing protests.

Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said "[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up", and that "[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply"; Le Monde added such comments were "in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers". No-confidence votes. Aftermath; evening. Spontaneous protests erupted throughout Paris. In the afternoon, those on the streets reacted to the results of the vote by chanting "Macron démission" ("Macron step down"). In the evening, in Place Vauban, protesters gathered, chanting "Macron resign!" and "Aux armes" (Take up arms), with police "push[ing] them back and blocked access to the square". Barricades were erected along the Rue de Rivoli. In Paris, protesters burned objects such as rubbish bins and bikes.CNN reported "heavy police presence across the capital as demonstrators moved between locations", with AP quoting Paris police chief Laurent Nunez, who said the violence was "caused by groups of up to 300 people quickly moving through the capital". At least 70 people were arrested in Paris in the evening, which later rose to 234; most were arrested for setting rubbish strewn in the streets alight.. Reuters reported that "[i]n some of Paris' most prestigious avenues, firefighters scrambled to put out burning rubbish piles left uncollected for days due to strikes as protesters played cat-and-mouse with police" and "[u]nions and opposition parties said they would step up protests to try and force a u-turn". A CGT statement read that "[n]othing undermines the mobilisation of workers," and called for workers to 'step up' industrial action and "participate massively in rolling strikes and demonstrations." Nunez announced that an internal investigation would take place after footage of an officer punching a man walking backwards, causing him to fall to the ground, went viral on French social media.AP said that the protests that took place in cities across France were predominantly "small" and "scattered", with only some "degenerating into violence" late in the day. In Bordeaux, a predominantly-young group of 200–300 people chanted for Macron to resign. A "couple" of rubbish bins were set alight, with the gathered protesters chanting "This will blow up". Protests were also reported in Dijon, and in Strasbourg where protestors smashed a department store's windows. 287 people in total were arrested nationwide.The office of Prime Minister Borne announced late in the evening that she will "directly submit the text of the new law to France's Constitutional Council for a review", and that she hopes that "all the points raised during the debates can be examined"; referring, as France 24 says, to the challenges raised by some parliamentarians on the constitutionality of certain measures in the pension reforms. Opponents of the reforms on the left and far-right have submitted requests for review; only once the Constitutional Council has approved the bill can it be formally signed into law, and it can "reject articles within the measure if they aren't in line with the constitution", with those opposed saying the text "as a whole should be rejected"; Borne's office added that the referral was to "accelerate the process". Furthermore, she "expressed the government's 'solidarity'" towards the 400 police officers who were injured in recent days, with 42 alone overnight. The Constitutional Council has a month to "consider any objections" to the bill. 21 March. On 21 March, Macron announced he does not intend to dissolve the National Assembly for new elections, reshuffle the government, or call a referendum for "a reform he considers necessary for the survival of the system", nor intends to withdraw the reforms. This was reasserted by Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt in Parliament; additionally, Borne said the government would attempt to involve the public and unions in legislating more in future, though offered no details as to how, and the two both agreed they had "devoted as much time to dialogue on the pension bill as possible". Macron, instead, plans to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and plan and prepare for further reforms to take place over the rest of his term in office. Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be "continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president's authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt". Paris's mayor supports a strike, and the government threatens to intervene if she doesn't comply. The French government, led by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, invoked Article 49.3 of the constitution to enact pension reforms without a parliamentary vote, causing protests and political backlash. Opposition MPs sang the national anthem and denounced the move, with some filing no-confidence motions. Politicians from various parties criticized the government, and protesters rallied in Paris and other cities, leading to clashes with police, arrests, and property damage. The CGT union announced further strikes and demonstrations, describing the government's move as undemocratic and disrespectful. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said that she supported the strike, and in response a government spokesman Olivier Véran declared that if she did not comply, the Interior Ministry would be "ready to act instead". Use of Article 49.3 and aftermath. 16 March. Use of Article 49.3. Protests erupted after the announcement that the pension reforms would be enacted without a parliamentary vote, Borne invoking article 49:3 of the constitution to do so just "minutes" before the scheduled vote on the bill. Inside the National Assembly, opposition MPs on the left booed and jeered the announcement and sang the national anthem in order to prevent Borne from speaking, forcing the session to be briefly suspended before the announcement by Borne was made. Speaking to MPs who were booing her, Borne proclaimed that "[w]e cannot gamble on the future of our pensions ... The reform is necessary."Marine Le Pen announced she would file a no-confidence motion in the government, describing the use of Article 49.3 as "an extraordinary confession of weakness," "a total failure for the government", and that Borne should resign. Fabien Roussel of the French Communist Party, who also "called on street protesters and trade unionists to keep mobilising", stated that the left was ready to make the same motion; Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure "accused Macron of deploying a "permanent coup d'état" to shove through the legislation". The Week said that "Macron and his government insist the reforms are needed to keep the pension system solvent and government borrowing acceptably low".Politicians from across the political spectrum denounced the move. Conservative MPs, such as those from The Republicans, whom Macron has relied upon for support in votes in the National Assembly, "rebuke[d] the government, warning that its move would radicalise opponents and undercut the law's democratic legitimacy." The Times reported that Macron was thought to have "hoped earlier on Thursday to hold – and win – a parliamentary vote but changed tack after learning that only 35 of the 64 Republican MPs would back the reform, leaving him short of a majority", quoting Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt, who said that they "did everything [to have a vote] right up to the last minute". MoDem MPs, who are aligned with Macron's Renaissance group, said the decision to force the bill through "was a mistake"; Erwan Balanant said "he had left the parliament chamber "in a state of shock"", while "[o]ther centrist MPs said it was a waste and showed weakness". Reaction by protesters. In the Place de la Concorde, thousands protested (figures are disputed between 2,000 protesters and 7,000). France 24 reported that it was a "spontaneous and unplanned rally", but Le Monde stated that it was "organized by the union Solidaires and authorized by the administrative court". La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon spoke to the crowd, declaring that Macron had gone "over the heads of the will of the people." He also claimed the reform had "no legitimacy – neither in parliament, nor in the street". It is possible that many joined the rally in Paris after being turned away by police from the "blockade of the Veolia warehouse in Aubervilliers".. Later, a bonfire was lit, with police armed with shields and batons deploying tear gas in an attempt to clear the square at around 8pm. One police officer was reportedly injured.By nightfall, 120 people were reported to have been arrested, according to Parisian police, "on suspicion of seeking to cause damage"; by 11:30pm, the number later rose to 217. Protesters in the Place were observed to have thrown cobbled stones at assembled police before they moved in to break up the groups, using tear gas and water cannons, with smaller sections of protesters running down side streets and setting smaller fires, such as to piles of garbage, and "caused damage to shop fronts". Numerous makeshift barricades in Paris streets were set alight.The CGT announced further strikes and demonstrations for 23 March; its head, Philippe Martinez, said that the forcing through of the law "shows contempt towards the people", with unions describing the move by the government as "a complete denial of democracy". France 24 commented that "unionists were also out in strength, hailing a moral victory even as they denounced Macron's "violation of democracy"".Protests took place in other cities, such as Rennes, Nantes, Lyon, Toulouse, and Marseille. In the latter, shop windows and bank fronts were smashed, for which "radical leftist groups" were partially blamed, with shops looted. Olivier Gantois, head of UFIP, believes fuel shortages are caused by panic buying, while protests erupted in Paris, with citizens chanting for the French President's resignation. Violence was attributed to groups of 300 moving quickly through the capital, resulting in 234 arrests. Protests also occurred in other cities, with varying levels of violence. Unions and opposition parties aim to increase protests to force a change in the pension reforms. Prime Minister Borne submitted the new law to France's Constitutional Council for review, aiming to accelerate the process. Macron announced he won't withdraw or change the pension reforms, but will use a TV interview to calm tensions and prepare for future reforms. There is unease within parties aligned with Macron regarding his response to the protests and strikes.

Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister. Riot police were also observed using baton charges on the Grands Boulevards. At other times on the march, fires in the streets ignited some of the uncollected piles of rubbish, with some small fires "visible from the junction of Rue Saint-Fiacre and Boulevard Poissonnière".. Mid-afternoon, clashes between police and protesters in Paris had grown more intense. On the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, one BFMTV report said "the atmosphere has changed completely" and that "[w]e didn't expect it to get out of hand so quickly". BFMTV also reported that there were at least 350–400 'black bloc' protesters, using "big" fireworks, and at point targeting a Strasbourg-St Denis McDonald's restaurant. A reporter claimed that police are deploying tear gas to push back the crowds, but it was ineffective due to the large number of people attending the protest. The police estimated that there were 1,000 protestors engaged in violence.By 5pm local time, demonstrators in Paris had converged on the Place de l'Opéra. Firecrackers and bins set alight around Avenue de l'Opéra were reported. At around 5:20pm, it was reported that that police on motorbikes had arrived in the Opera area. Known as the Motos Brav-M, it is a "controversial police unit", as "some have accused [them] of using excessive force". They were "booed and hissed" at as they "passed further away down Boulevard de l'Opéra". By 6pm, "most people [were] now dispersing", but "low-level clashes between police and small groups of rioters [who have] been throwing stones and starting fires" persisted. Up to 5,000 security staff were put on duty in Paris for the day. 320 protests were planned across the country, with the biggest demonstrations in the southern towns of Marseille, Nice, and Toulon; in the former two, "thousands of protesters" demonstrated. Marseille's port was blockaded by demonstrators for a second consecutive day. In Lyon, "hundreds of railway workers, students and others have taken to the tracks disrupting trains". In Normandy, "thousands" turned out in Rouen, Caen, Le Havre and Dieppe. In Rouen, riot police used tear gas against some protesters throwing stones, and in Rennes, used both tear gas and water cannons as "some masked protesters" erected barricades". In Nice, protesters converged on the city centre, before marching to the airport and forming a blockade.Yahoo! quoted local media that stated almost 10,000 were marching in Tours, where protesters blocked train tracks and caused disruption to train departures. Smoke was observed rising from burning debris that blocked traffic on a Toulouse highway, as "wildcat strikes briefly blocked roads in other cities". Police fired tear gas at protesters in Nantes, where also "a group of activists stormed the administrative court", and used water cannons in Rennes.. In Lorient, a local newspaper reported that projectiles were thrown into the yard of the police station, having "triggered a brief fire", with claims that multiple police officers had been "violently attacked". A local prefecture office also "came under attack" in the town, The Times claiming that activists "sought to storm a government building and to set fire to the town's police station". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin responded on Twitter: "The attacks on and defacing of the subprefecture and the police station in Lorient are unacceptable. Thoughts with the injured officers. These acts cannot go unpunished."The Independent reported that a "video on social media showed several trucks dumping tyres, rubbish and manure in front of council offices in several locations", and "[h]ighways were blocked with barriers of burning wood and tyres as protesters raised slogans".The Palais Rohan in Bordeaux was set on fire by protesters, affecting the front door, though the fire was put out promptly by firefighters.. In the evening, Interior Minister Darmanin made a statement where he declared that there had been an attempt to kill police officers by some protesters. BBC News and France 24 claim he announced 123 police officers had been injured nationwide, while an independent journalist said he claimed 149 had been injured in Paris alone. In Paris, one officer was "dragged to safety while unconscious, as he and his colleagues came under fire from fireworks and other missiles. The officer appeared to have been hit on the head". In the afternoon in Nantes, protestors threw bottles at police, who also responded with tear gas; in spite of this, DW described the protests in Nantes, as well as Marseille and Montpellier, as "mostly peaceful marches", as did the AP. They reported that in Marseille, protesters eluded police and occupied the main train station for approximately 15 minutes. In Besançon, "hundreds of demonstrators lit a brazier and burned voter cards. In Lyon, some demonstrators tried to break into a town hall and set it alight, with police arresting 36; police claimed that ""groups of violent individuals" triggered clashes".A spokesperson for TotalEnergies reported that 37% of its operational staff at refineries and depots, such as at Feyzin and Normandy, were on strike. Rolling strikes also continued on railways. Students and activists from the Permanent Revolution collective "briefly invaded" the Forum des Halles shopping mall, with banners calling for a general strike and chanting for Paris to "stand up" and "rise up", and letting off red smoke canisters. A representative of a union representing waste collectors said strikers at three incinerators outside of Paris would allow some trucks through to "limit the risk of an epidemic", while police claimed trucks from five depots had restarted work. CGT announced "strikers were halting production at two refineries over the weekend".CGT announced the shutdown of France's largest refinery, TotalEnergies' Gonfreville-L'Orcher (Seine-Maritime) site, and "at least two oil refineries might be shut down starting Monday". Industry Minister Roland Lescure announced the government could order those striking to return to work in order to help avoid fuel shortages.AP reported that the DGAC had requested 30% of flights at Orly Airport to be cancelled, and 20% in Marseille, for Monday 20 March. 19 March. "Hundreds" of protesters were reported in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille in the evening. In Marseille, a large bonfire was lit, with a large throng of demonstrators dancing around it.Some neighbourhoods of Paris continued to have collection of waste disrupted; Philippe Martinez from CGT "urged" Paris collection workers to continue their now-two-week-long strike. A few hundred people protested outside the Les Halles shopping centre before police moved them on. Early on Sunday, "dozens" of union activists marched through a shopping mall in Rosny-sous-Bois, and cars were allowed to pass through the tolls on the A1 and A13 motorways for free during the day. Shutdowns of refineries continued, with reports of petrol queues building up in the south of France; authorities claimed that "supplies were high enough to avoid shortages".In response to reports of constituency offices of various MPs being vandalized, Macron "called the speakers of both houses of parliament to affirm his support for all legislators and said the government was mobilized to "put everything in place to protect them" late on 19 March.Macron also made his first public statement since 16 March; issued to AFP, he said that he hoped "the text on pensions can go to the end of its democratic journey with respect for all". Bruno Le Maire, the Finance Minister, commented further; "[t]hose among us who are able will gradually need to work more to finance our social model, which is one of the most generous in the world". Leader of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, said his party would not back the no-confidence motions, as he "refuses to 'add chaos to chaos'"; consequently, it was expected that the motions would not pass, as the Republicans act as de-facto kingmakers in the National Assembly, neither Macron's bloc or the other opposition parties combined numbering a majority. NUPES' Jean-Luc Mélenchon informed RTL that "[f]or as long as the 64-year reform is on the table, we have to keep it up, but decried the use of violence, advising protesters to not "make our struggle invisible with practices that would be turned against us, as "Macron... is counting on people going too far, so as to profit from a situation of fear." The Times reported that, in response to Ciotti's party refusing to support the motions, and that some Republican MPs may not follow their leader's decision, National Rally president Jordan Bardella was attempting to "persuade more to follow suit by promising his party will not put up candidates against them if the crisis does lead to an election". 20 March. Morning and afternoon. DW reported, on 18 March, that union leaders were anticipating that some airports would see nearly a third of flights cancelled on 20 March, owing to strike action. easyJet and Ryanair, both British airlines, warned passengers to expect disruption. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were "charged with actual offences". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a "clear reason why", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were "rounded up", police justifying the arrests for their "participation in a group with a view to preparing violence", or "concealing their faces"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to "file a collective complaint against the police for "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate"."Such "arbitrary police custody", "mass-arrest", tactics have been accused – by politicians, judges and lawyers alike – of being utilised "simply to frustrate the protest movement", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a "repression of the social movement". This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used "criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom," said Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a "judicialisation of policing" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of "participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the "violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Clément Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that "there are no unjustified arrests", and people are questioned for "offences which, in our eyes, are constituted" and "48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding "when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the "manoeuvre is risky", as they "expose the workforce, monopolise officers" and "risk radicalising the demonstrators".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the "police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were "on pretty brutal form" – stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press – and were also throwing their stun grenades with "abandon". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for "excessive force" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be.

In a poll spanning 9 to 16 March, 70% of respondents were dissatisfied with him and only 28% were satisfied.It has been suggested that the reforms do not adequately tackle the disadvantage women are at within the workforce, who usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower in comparison, attributed to more part-time work and maternity leave. Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be "a bit penalised by the reform" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in 'physically or mentally demanding' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to "mollify opposition", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a "non-starter" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law. At the other end of the scale, it has been reported that some are concerned about "being forced to retire later because older adults who want to work but who lose their jobs often face age discrimination in the labor market".. Those opposed to the reforms argue "the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers", and have "disputed the need for urgency", The New York Times saying they contest that "Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy". In addition, opponents opine that Macron has "exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies", and that "the official body that monitors France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, "were hard to accurately predict".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France's political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the "pre-existing anger against" him, having "struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'". He said that "[t]hat's why he has not only all the unions, but also a large part of public opinion against him", as "[b]y tying himself to the project, opposition to it is heightened, dramatized in a way."It has been criticized for having taken place during a cost-of-living crisis, which some have attributed to worsening the anger and protests over the policies. The Times said that some have "questioned the political wisdom of going ahead with the reform at a time when the public mood has been soured by high inflation", as €7.1 billion of the €17.7 billion that "the reform was meant to have saved has been wiped out by modifications to its provisions". Rioting. The protests gave way to instances of violence and rioting as demonstrators and police forces clashed in the streets. Anti-union degradations. In Chambéry, "banners, sound systems, flags, and union tunics prepared for the 7 March demonstration went up in smoke" when fire was set to three vehicles parked in front of the Union hall.  The methods used resembled those used in other degradations in the area in the preceding year, including a swastika and anti-vax slogans spray-painted on the regional health agency (ARS) offices. Black bloc. There were black bloc groups at the front of the demonstrations in Paris, Lyon, and Nantes on May 1. There were between 2000 and 3000 in Paris, 1000 in Lyon (among 2000 the Rhône prefecture identified as "risky individuals"), and large numbers were also present in Nantes. Looting. An unauthorized protest on 15 April attracted over 1000 people to downtown Rennes and permitted two men to make off with €25,000 worth of gold bars and coins from a gold seller's shop. Pre-Article 49.3 invoking. 19 January. Protests in France over Macron's proposed pension reforms have resulted in injuries to both protesters and police. The use of excessive force by authorities has been criticized by the Council of Europe. The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is similar to former President Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which led to widespread protests and influenced the 2012 presidential election. Invoking Article 49.3 could be perceived as brutal and erode support for the government and democratic institutions. Alternatives to the pension reforms include firing the Prime Minister, holding a referendum, or triggering a 'RIP' before the enactment of the law. However, these options have their own requirements and potential consequences. Macron has stated that he will not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. The planned state visit of King Charles III to France has been postponed due to the ongoing protests. The left-wing coalition NUPES and some French deputies argue that a pension reform, included in the social security budget, is unconstitutional as it addresses more than just finances. They plan to use the Conseil d'État's warning to the government about the reform's potential unconstitutionality. In March, President Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms, and the state visit of King Charles III was postponed due to ongoing protests. The cancellation was met with mixed reactions in France, while international reactions included criticism from Iran and human rights organizations accusing French authorities of excessive force and violating protestors' rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities to protect peaceful demonstrations. During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for "excessive force" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which "were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be "perceived as a symbol of brutality" and could "erode support both for the government and democratic institutions". Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as "to try and reset his image", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support – unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) – and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a référendum d'initiative partagée (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done "before the enactment of the law"; yet, according to Stéphane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated "the retirement age cannot exceed 62". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, "thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work."Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, "several appeals" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would "argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances", and that "[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'État (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised.

Unions said some 1.3 million people participated nationwide Thursday, the lowest figure since the protest movement started on January 19. The interior ministry put the national figure at 440,000, down from nearly a million on Saturday (11 Feb). On the day, 30 percent of flights from Paris's Orly airport were cancelled. 7 March. In early March, trains around the country continued to be affected by strikes and protests. It is believed that 1.1 to 1.4 million people participated in over 260 protests across the country.

On Saturday, 11 March, the seventh day of protests was held in response to the National Assembly and Senate debating the draft law, with a final vote expected that month. Macron twice declined meetings with unions that week. About 368,000 people protested, below the 800,000–1,000,000 expected. The following day, the Senate passed an initial vote by 195–112. 15 March. On 14 March, The Guardian reported that "French unions have called for a show of force with a final day of strikes and protests in the run-up" the vote on the reforms in the National Assembly, which would be the eighth day of national mobilisation sofar. Transport Minister Clément Beaune said "there would be disruption to public transport and flights, but it was unlikely to be a "Black Wednesday"", with "not ... the same level of disruptions as with previous mobilisations".200 protests were reported to have taken place across the country. There were conflicting numbers of the strength of the protests; the Interior Ministry reported 480,000 marched throughout the country, with 37,000 in Paris, while CGT counted 1.78m and 450,000 respectively. Figures from Le Monde dispute both these claims. Reportedly, French police expected 650,000–850,000 protesters nationwide, fewer than the largest protests the previous week, with preliminary figures demonstrating a lower strike turnout in the energy and transport sectors at midday compared to previous days.Among those who were on strike were train drivers, school teachers, dock workers, oil refinery workers, as well as garbage collectors continuing their now ten-day strike action.In the afternoon, protesters gathered at the Esplanade des Invalides, with "loud music and huge union balloons". Police had ordered that the build-up of rubbish to be "cleared out along the march route" after some "used garbage to start fires or throw trash at police in recent demonstrations". The marchers were "accompanied by a heavy security force" as they "moved through the Left Bank along unencumbered streets". Police reported that one group of protestors "attacked a small business", and that nine people were detained within three hours of the march beginning. The protestors' march ended at the Place d'Italie. Known as "Greve 15 mars", it was co-ordinated and organised by eight trade unions.. Liquefied natural gas operations were suspended, with public transport severely affected; it was stated that 40% of high-speed trains and half the regional trains were cancelled, with the Paris Métro running slower. The DGAC warned of delays, reporting that 20% of the flights at Paris-Orly airport were cancelled.Elsewhere, in Rennes, Nantes, and Lyon, "[s]ecurity forces countered violence with charges and tear gas", according to French media. Demonstrations also took place in Le Havre in Normandy, Nice, and Mulhouse.PBS reported that Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin had asked Paris City Hall to force some of the garbage workers to return to work, calling the build-up along the streets a "a public health issue". Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said that she supported the strike, and in response a government spokesman Olivier Véran declared that if she did not comply, the Interior Ministry would be "ready to act instead". Use of Article 49.3 and aftermath. 16 March. Use of Article 49.3. Protests erupted after the announcement that the pension reforms would be enacted without a parliamentary vote, Borne invoking article 49:3 of the constitution to do so just "minutes" before the scheduled vote on the bill. Inside the National Assembly, opposition MPs on the left booed and jeered the announcement and sang the national anthem in order to prevent Borne from speaking, forcing the session to be briefly suspended before the announcement by Borne was made. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were "charged with actual offences". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a "clear reason why", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were "rounded up", police justifying the arrests for their "participation in a group with a view to preparing violence", or "concealing their faces"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to "file a collective complaint against the police for "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate"."Such "arbitrary police custody", "mass-arrest", tactics have been accused – by politicians, judges and lawyers alike – of being utilised "simply to frustrate the protest movement", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a "repression of the social movement".

Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a "judicialisation of policing" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of "participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the "violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Clément Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that "there are no unjustified arrests", and people are questioned for "offences which, in our eyes, are constituted" and "48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding "when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the "manoeuvre is risky", as they "expose the workforce, monopolise officers" and "risk radicalising the demonstrators".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the "police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were "on pretty brutal form" – stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press – and were also throwing their stun grenades with "abandon". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for "excessive force" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24's words, "achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be "withdrawn", that his union "condemn[s] violence", but added "look at the anger. It's very strong, even among our ranks".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that – alongside the leader of the Republicans' office being vandalised – other MPs from the party were "receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day". Frédérique Meunier told BFMTV that "[i]t's as if tomorrow they want to decapitate us", and that the emails being received "amounted to harassment". The constituency offices of Renaissance MPs – the party from which Macron originates – were also targeted. BBC News's Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, on 22 March, said that the protests in recent days had been "spectacular, sometimes, visually" but "not huge in terms of scale" and "mostly .. the work of very committed left-wingers, class-warrior types, who are leading the battle". Natasha Butler of Al Jazeera said the violence in recent days was "sporadic". Waste collection strike. A strike by waste collectors began on 6 March, which included a blockade of the city's incinerators. Originally set to last nine days, it was extended by another five on 15 March. As of 15 March, "bin lorries [were] grounded at depots and at least three waste incinerators in the Paris area [were] at a standstill".The impact of the waste workers' strike has left thousands of tonnes of rubbish uncollected on the streets of Paris. On 17 March, it was estimated the amount was 10,000 tonnes, up from 7,600 earlier in the week. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that "strikers were being forced back under emergency powers designed to safeguard essential services", and from the morning of 17 March told RTL radio that "requisitioning is working and bins are being emptied", although this was disputed by an aide of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Hidalgo has maintained her support for the strikers despite efforts by government to break it, with the deputy mayor in charge of waste, Colombe Brossel, commenting that "any demand to force strikers back to work would be "an attack on the constitutional right to strike"."Paris' municipal waste collectors started its strike and blockade of the city's incinerators twelve days earlier; the proposed pension reforms would raise their retirement age from 57 to 59. Waste collection in Paris is split around half-and-half between them and private companies, who remained in operation with some taking contracts to operate in areas worst hit by the strike action; such as the ninth district, whose mayor, Delphine Burkli, suggested "calling in the army to clear the streets."Waste collection strikes also affected Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre.On 18 March, the mayor of Paris' 12th district, Emmanuelle Pierre-Marie, said that the priority was food waste in the streets – AP describing the "uncollected garbage" as having "become a visual and olfactory symbol of the actions to defeat the president's pension reform plan" – "because it is what brings pests to the surface" and that they "are extremely sensitive to the situation. As soon as we have a dumpster truck available, we give priority to the places most concerned, like food markets." It was claimed that police had "requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods".As of 19 March, Philippe Martinez from CGT had "urged" Paris collection workers to continue their now-two-week-long strike.The strike was suspended on 29 March due to declining participation, partly due to requisitions order by the Paris police. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were "charged with actual offences". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a "clear reason why", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. The methods used resembled those used in other degradations in the area in the preceding year, including a swastika and anti-vax slogans spray-painted on the regional health agency (ARS) offices.

Reuters reported that "[i]n some of Paris' most prestigious avenues, firefighters scrambled to put out burning rubbish piles left uncollected for days due to strikes as protesters played cat-and-mouse with police" and "[u]nions and opposition parties said they would step up protests to try and force a u-turn". A CGT statement read that "[n]othing undermines the mobilisation of workers," and called for workers to 'step up' industrial action and "participate massively in rolling strikes and demonstrations." Nunez announced that an internal investigation would take place after footage of an officer punching a man walking backwards, causing him to fall to the ground, went viral on French social media.AP said that the protests that took place in cities across France were predominantly "small" and "scattered", with only some "degenerating into violence" late in the day.

Opponents of the reforms on the left and far-right have submitted requests for review; only once the Constitutional Council has approved the bill can it be formally signed into law, and it can "reject articles within the measure if they aren't in line with the constitution", with those opposed saying the text "as a whole should be rejected"; Borne's office added that the referral was to "accelerate the process".

Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be "continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president's authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt". Art students in Paris protested against the proposed increase in retirement age by building a barricade outside their school and carrying signs threatening a new May 1968. In Rennes, skips were set on fire during a protest.

In the evening, Interior Minister Darmanin made a statement where he declared that there had been an attempt to kill police officers by some protesters.

The leader of the CGT union, Berger, cautioned the government that protests in France could turn more violent if demonstrators believe the Yellow Vests have achieved greater results through violence than peaceful mass demonstrations by established unions. Waste collectors in Paris initiated a strike on March 6, which expanded to include blockades of the city's incinerators, causing thousands of tonnes of rubbish to accumulate on the streets. Despite efforts by the government to end the strike, Paris's mayor, Hidalgo, has expressed her support for the strikers. The waste collection strike also impacted other cities, including Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre. Police have requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods, and many of those arrested during the protests were later released without charge. 19 May.

Protesters also stormed the headquarters of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, briefly occupying the headquarters building, however no damage occurred. 11,000 law enforcement officers were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris. General impact and analysis. Concerns over increasing violence. Multiple outlets, including media and unions, have grown concern over the increasing use of violence in the protests, particularly in the days since the government invoked Article 49.3, with comparisons made to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests of the first years of Macron's presidency. On 19 March, The Guardian commented that as "police brace[d] for a week of unpredictable, spontaneous protests in cities and small towns across France, the mood of anger was likened to the start of the gilets jaunes protests". On 20 March, Reuters also voiced that the tone of the protests had deteriorated to, and were "reminiscent" to, that of the Yellow Vest protest in recent days. Euronews, on 21 March, claimed that "government insiders and observers have raised fears that France is again heading for another bout of violent anti-government protests". On 22 March, Reuters outlined that "[p]rotests against the bill have drawn huge crowds in rallies organised by unions since January", of which "[m]ost have been peaceful, but anger has mounted since the government pushed the bill through parliament without a vote last week"; "[t]he past six nights have seen fierce demonstrations across France with bins set ablaze and scuffles with police".France 24 commented that unions had been "united in coordinating their protests", but that "many expressed fears they could lose control of the protests as more radical demonstrators set the tone". Fabrice Coudour, a leading representative for the 'hard-left' CGT, commented that "tougher action ahead, more serious and further-reaching" was possible that could "escape our collective decision-making". Jean-Marie Pernot, a political scientist specialising in trade unions, said that a lack of "respect [for] any of the channels meant for the expression of dissent, it will find a way to express itself directly". One of the Yellow Vests' "prominent spokesmen", Jerome Rodrigues, spoke to protesters outside the National Assembly after the invoking of Article 49.3 on 17 March, that "the objective was now nothing less than "the defeat" of the president."Head of the UNSA trade union federation, Lauren Escure, admitted that "when there is this much anger and so many French people on the streets, the more radical elements take the floor", and that it was not something they would want, but was inevitable, and "will be entirely the government's fault," he told AFP. The heads of two 'moderate' unions, Cyril Chabanier of CFTC and Laurent Berger of CFDT, expressed that unions were concerned. Cabanier said that an impression that "it is just violence that pays" was being created, and that "[t]here are some people who are very angry, [and] the anger leads to greater radicalisation and radicalisation unfortunately leads to violence". Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24's words, "achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be "withdrawn", that his union "condemn[s] violence", but added "look at the anger. It's very strong, even among our ranks".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that – alongside the leader of the Republicans' office being vandalised – other MPs from the party were "receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day". Frédérique Meunier told BFMTV that "[i]t's as if tomorrow they want to decapitate us", and that the emails being received "amounted to harassment". The constituency offices of Renaissance MPs – the party from which Macron originates – were also targeted. Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations.

Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations. There have also been reports of threatening emails and vandalism targeting the offices of certain political parties. The Times reported that, in response to Ciotti's party refusing to support the motions, and that some Republican MPs may not follow their leader's decision, National Rally president Jordan Bardella was attempting to "persuade more to follow suit by promising his party will not put up candidates against them if the crisis does lead to an election". 20 March.

The road blockade was attended by a "few hundred people". It began at 6:30am, and led to "over 15 miles of halted traffic around the city". Police used tear gas and charged towards protesters who were on the road and in surrounding fields. Shortly before midday, it was announced they had all been lifted. However, a damaged road in Porte de Saint-Malo meant the speed limit was temporarily reduced to 70 kilometers per hour. Crisis24 said that industrial action at oil refineries was "starting to impact fuel supplies", with shortages of fuel at stations, "particularly" in Marseille and the south of the country. Sky News, on 17 March, stated that garbage collection strikes are set to continue until at least 20 March.SNCF has warned of "disruption to intercity and regional train services", with only two out of three trains running on several lines of Paris' RATP network. Crisis24 reported that such disruptions will continue until 23 March, when the national strike will exacerbate service provision.On 17 March, teachers' unions called for strikes in the following weeks, possibly disrupting the baccalauréat exams, which begin on 20 March. CFDT's Laurent Berger proclaimed that she wished for no disruption to the exams as they could just worsen the already-high stress levels of the students taking them.39% of TotalEnergie workers were on strike. Le Monde reported that half "of filling stations lacked one or more fuels in the southeastern region of Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur, requiring local authorities to limit sales until Thursday", with prohibition on the filling of jerry cans, and "many areas" in the west of the country affected by the continued blockade, and closure, of the Donges refinery. As well as this, they quoted figures from the UFIP oil lobby that 7% of the country's petrol stations were affected by fuel shortages, (up from 4% prior to the weekend; and that only 5–8 of 200 storage facilities were blocked) meaning "people in major cities in particular would be "suffering"; this was worse in some areas, as in Marseille, "around half of petrol stations are reporting shortages, with an estimated 40 per cent completely closed in Bouches-du-Rhône", and that "the Paris region could be hit by shortages at the storage facility of Genevilliers, northwest of the French capital". The "collaborative website" Penurie.mon-essence.fr said that approximately 986 fuel stations were "plagued by partial shortages", with 739 out of fuel "completely". Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said "[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up", and that "[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply"; Le Monde added such comments were "in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers". No-confidence votes. Aftermath; evening. Spontaneous protests erupted throughout Paris. In the afternoon, those on the streets reacted to the results of the vote by chanting "Macron démission" ("Macron step down"). In the evening, in Place Vauban, protesters gathered, chanting "Macron resign!" and "Aux armes" (Take up arms), with police "push[ing] them back and blocked access to the square".

The Education Ministry stated that about 24% of primary and middle school teachers walked off the job, as well as 15% in high schools. Exam supervisors also went on strike, disrupting baccalauréat exams, with over half a million students impacted.Workers voted to strike at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk, reducing output to the minimum. Amid oil refinery and depot blockades, 14% of petrol stations were experiencing shortages of at least one type of fuel, with 7% dry. The impact varied nationwide, with reports suggesting that 40 out of 96 departments are affected, particularly in the north in Brittany and Normandy, as well as the Mediterranean coast. The government mandated minimum staffing at all depots.The entrance to Paris-Panthéon-Assas University, widely considered the top law school of France, was barricaded; France 24 commented this was "a sign of just how broad the protest movement has become". Major tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and the Versailles Palace were closed to the public. Protests. The Independent claimed over "12,000 police officers have taken positions in French streets with 5,000 in Paris, as authorities brace for the biggest strike action".Numbers of demonstrators vary. The Interior Ministry said up to 1.08m took part in protests across France, with 119,000 in Paris; the latter is the highest number to have protested in Paris since the strikes and protests related to the reforms began in January. The CGT union, meanwhile, claimed 3.5m nationwide, and 800,000 in Paris.. Demonstrations in Paris began at the Place de la Bastille at 2pm local time.

Posters along the route of the demonstrations in Paris included those demanding a return to the retirement age of 60, and depicting Macron as Louis XVI. A heavy presence of "[h]eavily armed riot police" was reported. At around 2:40pm GMT, journalist Lewis Goodall claimed that "[t]he main demonstration route [in Paris] is full [and so] they're now filing onto every side street". He quoted the CGT union's claims that 800,000 were demonstrating in Paris. At around 4:05pm GMT, he tweeted that French TV were reporting 14 were arrested so far, presumably in Paris.. BBC News said "the vast majority" of protests "passed off without violence", but in the afternoon, "violent clashes" were reported to have "broken out in parts of Paris", riot police having used tear gas as 'black bloc' protesters were reported to have thrown fireworks, bottles and stones at police and set bins alight. Riot police were also observed using baton charges on the Grands Boulevards. At other times on the march, fires in the streets ignited some of the uncollected piles of rubbish, with some small fires "visible from the junction of Rue Saint-Fiacre and Boulevard Poissonnière".. Mid-afternoon, clashes between police and protesters in Paris had grown more intense. On the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, one BFMTV report said "the atmosphere has changed completely" and that "[w]e didn't expect it to get out of hand so quickly". BFMTV also reported that there were at least 350–400 'black bloc' protesters, using "big" fireworks, and at point targeting a Strasbourg-St Denis McDonald's restaurant. Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said "[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up", and that "[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply"; Le Monde added such comments were "in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers".

Barricades were erected along the Rue de Rivoli. In Paris, protesters burned objects such as rubbish bins and bikes.CNN reported "heavy police presence across the capital as demonstrators moved between locations", with AP quoting Paris police chief Laurent Nunez, who said the violence was "caused by groups of up to 300 people quickly moving through the capital". At least 70 people were arrested in Paris in the evening, which later rose to 234; most were arrested for setting rubbish strewn in the streets alight.. Reuters reported that "[i]n some of Paris' most prestigious avenues, firefighters scrambled to put out burning rubbish piles left uncollected for days due to strikes as protesters played cat-and-mouse with police" and "[u]nions and opposition parties said they would step up protests to try and force a u-turn". A CGT statement read that "[n]othing undermines the mobilisation of workers," and called for workers to 'step up' industrial action and "participate massively in rolling strikes and demonstrations." Nunez announced that an internal investigation would take place after footage of an officer punching a man walking backwards, causing him to fall to the ground, went viral on French social media.AP said that the protests that took place in cities across France were predominantly "small" and "scattered", with only some "degenerating into violence" late in the day. In Bordeaux, a predominantly-young group of 200–300 people chanted for Macron to resign. A "couple" of rubbish bins were set alight, with the gathered protesters chanting "This will blow up". Protests were also reported in Dijon, and in Strasbourg where protestors smashed a department store's windows. 287 people in total were arrested nationwide.The office of Prime Minister Borne announced late in the evening that she will "directly submit the text of the new law to France's Constitutional Council for a review", and that she hopes that "all the points raised during the debates can be examined"; referring, as France 24 says, to the challenges raised by some parliamentarians on the constitutionality of certain measures in the pension reforms. Opponents of the reforms on the left and far-right have submitted requests for review; only once the Constitutional Council has approved the bill can it be formally signed into law, and it can "reject articles within the measure if they aren't in line with the constitution", with those opposed saying the text "as a whole should be rejected"; Borne's office added that the referral was to "accelerate the process". Furthermore, she "expressed the government's 'solidarity'" towards the 400 police officers who were injured in recent days, with 42 alone overnight. The Constitutional Council has a month to "consider any objections" to the bill. 21 March. On 21 March, Macron announced he does not intend to dissolve the National Assembly for new elections, reshuffle the government, or call a referendum for "a reform he considers necessary for the survival of the system", nor intends to withdraw the reforms. This was reasserted by Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt in Parliament; additionally, Borne said the government would attempt to involve the public and unions in legislating more in future, though offered no details as to how, and the two both agreed they had "devoted as much time to dialogue on the pension bill as possible". Macron, instead, plans to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and plan and prepare for further reforms to take place over the rest of his term in office. Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be "continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president's authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt".

In the evening, Interior Minister Darmanin made a statement where he declared that there had been an attempt to kill police officers by some protesters. BBC News and France 24 claim he announced 123 police officers had been injured nationwide, while an independent journalist said he claimed 149 had been injured in Paris alone. In Paris, one officer was "dragged to safety while unconscious, as he and his colleagues came under fire from fireworks and other missiles. The officer appeared to have been hit on the head". In Rouen, a young woman was reported to have lost her thumb after hit by a 'flash ball' grenade used by police to try and disperse protesters – Damien Adam, Renaissance MP for the area, "says it's "clearly unacceptable" and he wants a police inquiry to find out what happened" – and police confirmed two officers were injured after missiles were thrown at them. LFI officials have "complained that six protesters had been hurt by police tear gas and stun grenades and wants to know what orders officers were given".Darmanin claimed over 80 people had been arrested so far. Shortages of firefighters in the evening meant that local residents themselves had to put out fires themselves; Darmanin claimed 140 fires needed to be put out in Paris, with 50 still burning at the time (approximately 8:30pm GMT).In the afternoon, union heads Berger and Martinez spoke out. Berger appealed for non-violence, for the "respect of property and people", for "non-violent actions that don't handicap people's daily lives". Martinez claimed Macron was blamed for the actions of protesters and demonstrators, saying he had "thrown a can of petrol on the fire". Hugh Schofield of BBC News said that unions and the left "are calling the day a success, with once again a large turn-out of people showing their rejection of Macron's pension bill". 28 March. On 28 March, a tenth day of protests was estimated at 740,000 attendees by the French government and 2 million by unions. Prime Minister Borne declined formal mediation, but agreed to talks with eight leading union leaders the following week, when an eleventh day of protest was planned. 6 April. The union leaders' meeting with Borne on 5 April ended after about an hour after both sides insisted that the pension reform must respectively be cancelled or remain. Union leaders exiting the meeting called for an eleventh day of protests to go ahead the following day. According to French authorities, between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators were expected, with 60,000 to 90,000 in Paris. According to the French Interior Ministry, 111 arrests were made and 154 police officers were injured.

On 14 April, the Constitutional Council delivered its verdict on the pension bill, declaring it to be compatible with the Constitution. Prior to the ruling being made public, French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne had said that the proposal was "nearing the end of its democratic process," and said there were "no winners or losers." Macron signed the bill later that same day. Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said the government is already working hard to implement the changes by 1 September. Before the Constitutional Council's decision, Macron invited labour unions to meet with him. The unions rejected Macron's invitation, noting that he had refused their previous offers of a meeting, and called for mass new protests on 1 May, International Workers Day. 17 April. On 17 April, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to a government action plan in the next 100 days to decrease anger over the pension reform. Macron had also acknowledged the anger over the increasing prices jobs that didn't "allow too many French people to live well". Macron also stated that he wanted the Prime Minister, Élisabeth Borne, to take measure on work, law and order, education, and health conditions and issues. 19 April. During Emmanuel Macron's tour of France, protesters gathered in Muttersholtz, wearing CGT vests and held unwelcoming signs and banners, including one banner which threatened to cancel the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics if Macron did not withdraw the pension reform. Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said "[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up", and that "[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply"; Le Monde added such comments were "in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers".

Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be "continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president's authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt". Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were "charged with actual offences". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a "clear reason why", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were "rounded up", police justifying the arrests for their "participation in a group with a view to preparing violence", or "concealing their faces"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to "file a collective complaint against the police for "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate"."Such "arbitrary police custody", "mass-arrest", tactics have been accused – by politicians, judges and lawyers alike – of being utilised "simply to frustrate the protest movement", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a "repression of the social movement". This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used "criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom," said Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a "judicialisation of policing" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of "participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the "violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Clément Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that "there are no unjustified arrests", and people are questioned for "offences which, in our eyes, are constituted" and "48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding "when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the "manoeuvre is risky", as they "expose the workforce, monopolise officers" and "risk radicalising the demonstrators".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the "police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were "on pretty brutal form" – stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press – and were also throwing their stun grenades with "abandon". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for "excessive force" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24's words, "achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be "withdrawn", that his union "condemn[s] violence", but added "look at the anger. It's very strong, even among our ranks".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that – alongside the leader of the Republicans' office being vandalised – other MPs from the party were "receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day". Frédérique Meunier told BFMTV that "[i]t's as if tomorrow they want to decapitate us", and that the emails being received "amounted to harassment". The constituency offices of Renaissance MPs – the party from which Macron originates – were also targeted. BBC News's Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, on 22 March, said that the protests in recent days had been "spectacular, sometimes, visually" but "not huge in terms of scale" and "mostly .. the work of very committed left-wingers, class-warrior types, who are leading the battle". Natasha Butler of Al Jazeera said the violence in recent days was "sporadic". Waste collection strike. A strike by waste collectors began on 6 March, which included a blockade of the city's incinerators. Originally set to last nine days, it was extended by another five on 15 March. As of 15 March, "bin lorries [were] grounded at depots and at least three waste incinerators in the Paris area [were] at a standstill".The impact of the waste workers' strike has left thousands of tonnes of rubbish uncollected on the streets of Paris. On 17 March, it was estimated the amount was 10,000 tonnes, up from 7,600 earlier in the week. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that "strikers were being forced back under emergency powers designed to safeguard essential services", and from the morning of 17 March told RTL radio that "requisitioning is working and bins are being emptied", although this was disputed by an aide of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Hidalgo has maintained her support for the strikers despite efforts by government to break it, with the deputy mayor in charge of waste, Colombe Brossel, commenting that "any demand to force strikers back to work would be "an attack on the constitutional right to strike"."Paris' municipal waste collectors started its strike and blockade of the city's incinerators twelve days earlier; the proposed pension reforms would raise their retirement age from 57 to 59. Waste collection in Paris is split around half-and-half between them and private companies, who remained in operation with some taking contracts to operate in areas worst hit by the strike action; such as the ninth district, whose mayor, Delphine Burkli, suggested "calling in the army to clear the streets."Waste collection strikes also affected Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre.On 18 March, the mayor of Paris' 12th district, Emmanuelle Pierre-Marie, said that the priority was food waste in the streets – AP describing the "uncollected garbage" as having "become a visual and olfactory symbol of the actions to defeat the president's pension reform plan" – "because it is what brings pests to the surface" and that they "are extremely sensitive to the situation. As soon as we have a dumpster truck available, we give priority to the places most concerned, like food markets." It was claimed that police had "requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods".As of 19 March, Philippe Martinez from CGT had "urged" Paris collection workers to continue their now-two-week-long strike.The strike was suspended on 29 March due to declining participation, partly due to requisitions order by the Paris police. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were "charged with actual offences". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a "clear reason why", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy..

France 24 said that NUPES would "argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances", and that "[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'État (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised. The author of a biography of the late Queen Elizabeth II, Stephen Clarke, said it was "very bad timing", and that while the people of France would "normally ... welcome a British king", "in this moment, people protesting are on high alert for any sign of privilege and wealth"; Associated Press (AP) commented that "what was meant to be a show of bonhomie and friendship ... instead ... is being seen as an unnecessary display of hereditary privilege". He added that the King and Queen Consort's plans to attend a "lavish dinner at the former royal residence, the Versailles Palace", "does not look good", and "seems very 1789". Associated Press clarified that the "lavish Versailles, once the dazzling center of royal Europe, is a potent symbol of social inequalities and excess". The Daily Telegraph reported that the banquet, intended to take place on 27 March, could be cancelled or moved.EELV MP Sandrine Rousseau called for the trip to be cancelled, asking if "the priority [is] really to receive Charles III at Versailles? Something is taking place within French society... the priority is to go and talk to society which is rising up."On 23 March, Associated Press reported how the CGT's members at Mobilier National (the institution in charge of providing flags, red carpets and furniture for public buildings) "would not help prepare a Sunday reception for the king upon his arrival in Paris"; in response, the Élysée Palace said "non-striking workers would set up the necessary accoutrements for the trip". On 23 March, unions called for their tenth day of nationwide action for 28 March, coinciding with the last full day of the state visit.On 24 March, at the request of the French Government, the state visit was postponed. Macron reportedly decided it would no longer be feasible or appropriate for the visit to take place once unions announced the tenth day of national walkouts on the 28 March, during the state visit. Éric Ciotti, leader of the Republicans said the cancellation brought "shame on our country", while Mélenchon was of an opposing mood, "delighted" that the "meeting of kings at Versailles" had been broken up, and that "the English knew that France's interior minister was pathetic on security". The visit was rescheduled for some time in the summer, "when things calm down again". International reactions. Iran condemned what it called France's repression of protests. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said "We call on the French government to respect human rights" and further added "instead of creating chaos in other countries, listen to the voice of your people and avoid violence against them."France's Human Rights League has accused the authorities of disproportionate and dangerous use of public force, undermining citizens' right to protest. The league's president said "The authoritarian shift of the French state, the brutalisation of social relations through its police, violence of all kinds and impunity are a major scandal."Rights groups and independent bodies, including the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, have criticized French police for resorting to excessive force and for making preventative arrests that could amount to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The French Defender of Rights noted on March 21 that "this practice may induce a risk of disproportionately resorting to custodial measures and fostering tensions." Human Rights Watch told AFP it was very concerned about "what appears to be abusive police practices."According to Reporters Without Borders, several "clearly identifiable" journalists were assaulted by security forces during the demonstrations.On March 20, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities that “peaceful demonstrations are a fundamental right that the authorities must guarantee and protect. The Times reported that, in response to Ciotti's party refusing to support the motions, and that some Republican MPs may not follow their leader's decision, National Rally president Jordan Bardella was attempting to "persuade more to follow suit by promising his party will not put up candidates against them if the crisis does lead to an election". 20 March. Morning and afternoon. DW reported, on 18 March, that union leaders were anticipating that some airports would see nearly a third of flights cancelled on 20 March, owing to strike action. easyJet and Ryanair, both British airlines, warned passengers to expect disruption. Ryanair said it was "expecting possible cancellations and delays on flights to and from France from 20 to 23 March." Eurostar announced that trains would run a normal service on 20 and 21 March, but there would be disruption to public transport in Lille on 20 March.In the morning, rubbish piles were set alight around the ring road in Rennes as part of a road blockade, with protesters also blockading waste collection points and the nearby Vern-sur-Seiche oil depot was blockaded. The road blockade was attended by a "few hundred people". It began at 6:30am, and led to "over 15 miles of halted traffic around the city". Police used tear gas and charged towards protesters who were on the road and in surrounding fields. Shortly before midday, it was announced they had all been lifted. However, a damaged road in Porte de Saint-Malo meant the speed limit was temporarily reduced to 70 kilometers per hour. Crisis24 said that industrial action at oil refineries was "starting to impact fuel supplies", with shortages of fuel at stations, "particularly" in Marseille and the south of the country. Sky News, on 17 March, stated that garbage collection strikes are set to continue until at least 20 March.SNCF has warned of "disruption to intercity and regional train services", with only two out of three trains running on several lines of Paris' RATP network. Crisis24 reported that such disruptions will continue until 23 March, when the national strike will exacerbate service provision.On 17 March, teachers' unions called for strikes in the following weeks, possibly disrupting the baccalauréat exams, which begin on 20 March. CFDT's Laurent Berger proclaimed that she wished for no disruption to the exams as they could just worsen the already-high stress levels of the students taking them.39% of TotalEnergie workers were on strike. Le Monde reported that half "of filling stations lacked one or more fuels in the southeastern region of Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur, requiring local authorities to limit sales until Thursday", with prohibition on the filling of jerry cans, and "many areas" in the west of the country affected by the continued blockade, and closure, of the Donges refinery. As well as this, they quoted figures from the UFIP oil lobby that 7% of the country's petrol stations were affected by fuel shortages, (up from 4% prior to the weekend; and that only 5–8 of 200 storage facilities were blocked) meaning "people in major cities in particular would be "suffering"; this was worse in some areas, as in Marseille, "around half of petrol stations are reporting shortages, with an estimated 40 per cent completely closed in Bouches-du-Rhône", and that "the Paris region could be hit by shortages at the storage facility of Genevilliers, northwest of the French capital". The "collaborative website" Penurie.mon-essence.fr said that approximately 986 fuel stations were "plagued by partial shortages", with 739 out of fuel "completely". Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said "[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up", and that "[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply"; Le Monde added such comments were "in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers". No-confidence votes. Aftermath; evening. Spontaneous protests erupted throughout Paris. In the afternoon, those on the streets reacted to the results of the vote by chanting "Macron démission" ("Macron step down"). In the evening, in Place Vauban, protesters gathered, chanting "Macron resign!" and "Aux armes" (Take up arms), with police "push[ing] them back and blocked access to the square". Barricades were erected along the Rue de Rivoli. During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for "excessive force" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which "were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be "perceived as a symbol of brutality" and could "erode support both for the government and democratic institutions". Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as "to try and reset his image", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support – unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) – and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a référendum d'initiative partagée (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done "before the enactment of the law"; yet, according to Stéphane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated "the retirement age cannot exceed 62". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, "thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work."Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, "several appeals" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would "argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances", and that "[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'État (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised. This was reasserted by Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt in Parliament; additionally, Borne said the government would attempt to involve the public and unions in legislating more in future, though offered no details as to how, and the two both agreed they had "devoted as much time to dialogue on the pension bill as possible". Macron, instead, plans to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and plan and prepare for further reforms to take place over the rest of his term in office. Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be "continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president's authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt". Gilles Le Gendre, a senior Renaissance MP, said that "the president, the government and the majority ... are all weakened" and that "it's not because the law was adopted that we can do business as usual". Also of Renaissance, Patrick Vignal "bluntly urged the president to suspend the pension reform bill" due to "the anger it has triggered, and its deep unpopularity".Reuters quoted Eurointelligence analysts, who said Macron has two choices: "[p]retending that nothing major happened and letting the crisis wear itself out, or pursuing co-habitation with the willing in the assembly. Given Macron's nature, we see him being more attracted to the first option. A risky bet."On 20 March, CNN reported that "[a]uthorities in charge of civil air traffic asked airlines to cancel 20% of their flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Air France warned of flight cancellations in the upcoming days".Police "were sent in the early hours of Tuesday to unblock the oil terminal of Donges ... which had been occupied for a week by strikers. The Ministry of Energy Transition "also announced the requisition of "three employees per shift" at an oil storage facility in Fos-sur-Mer", due to "worsening supply tensions"; they clarified that "[t]he requisition is valid for 48 hours as needed, starting March 21," and relates to "personnel essential to the operation of the storage facility""."Hundreds" of workers have blocked access to the gas depots in a town near Marseille, with strikes at multiple refineries across western and southern France, "partially disrupt[ing]" oil shipments. Striking workers clashing with police at ExxonMobil's Fos-sur-Mer oil refinery, as the Energy Transition Ministry announced it would need employees "indispensable to the functioning" of the depot to return to work. "Scuffles broke out", with protesters joining strikers in response to the news. Protestors attempted to block access to the site, some "intermittently thr[owing] objects" such as stones at police, which used tear gas to try to disperse the demonstrators. AP added that the depot supplies fuel for southeastern France gas stations, which are currently most afflicted by shortages; government spokesman Olivier Veran "warned that more orders may follow in the coming days for other sites". In Paris, police Paris announced they had ordered rubbish collectors back to work to "ensure a 'minimum service'; this will cover 674 staff, with 206 garbage trucks resuming operation.The Guardian, in an article dated 21 March, detailed activity at a blockaded incineration plant in Ivry-sur-Seine, south of Paris. A "crowd of students gathered to support the strikers" at the depot, with only "a slow dribble of very few rubbish trucks ... now passing each day" there. The blockade has been ongoing since at least 14 March, with some strikers and their supporters having attended as early as 5am over the course of the action.In the morning, police had evacuated Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University's Tolbiac campus, having been previously blockaded and barricaded by students (which has notorious precedent in that regard); an attendee mentioned that many young students there had spoken of their experiences of police violence. Outside the École Duperré art school, students had "piled up a barricade of bins", with signs saying that the decision to raise the retirement age "would be met with a new May 1968"; one student interviewed said she was too frightened of being the victim of police violence at night to demonstrate at that time of day. Skips were set alight during a protest in Rennes. 22 March. At lunchtime, Macron gave a televised interview, questioned by journalists from TF1 and France 2.

The French police have been accused of using excessive force, making preventative arrests, and assaulting journalists during protests, according to various human rights groups, the French Defender of Rights, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association. The Council of Europe has condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned against excessive use of force by state agents. The White House and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece have expressed support for the right to protest in France. A rally in Paris saw the International Anthem played, and the General Secretary was given a "Friends of the Paris Commune" handkerchief. The league's president said "The authoritarian shift of the French state, the brutalisation of social relations through its police, violence of all kinds and impunity are a major scandal."Rights groups and independent bodies, including the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, have criticized French police for resorting to excessive force and for making preventative arrests that could amount to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The French Defender of Rights noted on March 21 that "this practice may induce a risk of disproportionately resorting to custodial measures and fostering tensions." Human Rights Watch told AFP it was very concerned about "what appears to be abusive police practices."According to Reporters Without Borders, several "clearly identifiable" journalists were assaulted by security forces during the demonstrations.On March 20, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities that “peaceful demonstrations are a fundamental right that the authorities must guarantee and protect. Law enforcement officers must facilitate them and avoid excessive use of force.”The Council of Europe condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned that sporadic acts of violence could not justify "excessive use of force by agents of the state."White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated "We support the right of people to protest and to express their opinions" when asked about the situation in France.Dimitris Koutsoumpas, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece, attended a rally in Paris on 23 March; in a statement from Bastille Square, expressing his solidarity with the "struggle of the French people ... against anti-labor policies, against the anti-popular choices" utilised by both the French and the Greek governments in order to ensure the working people "finally win" and "pave the way for their own interests and not the interests and profits of the few." The International Anthem was played over loudspeakers, with the railway workers and trade unionists being spoken to offering him a "Friends of the Paris Commune" handkerchief. After protests in France, many people were arrested, with some being taken into custody without a clear reason. This has led to concerns about "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate." The police have been accused of using mass arrests to suppress the protest movement. The use of criminal law to discourage demonstrators is reportedly unprecedented. The police have also been accused of using excessive force and disproportionately targeting young women. The protests were sparked by a proposed increase in the retirement age. This proposal has been compared to a similar reform in 2010, which led to widespread protests and was seen as a factor in the subsequent election. There are concerns that the current protests could have political ramifications, similar to those seen in 2010. Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.

Thousands of volunteers and emergency workers from various organizations, including Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, and the Turkish Red Crescent, have been evacuating and providing aid to people affected by earthquakes in southern Turkey. The Turkish government has declared a state of emergency in the 10 affected provinces and has appealed for international aid. Search and rescue operations have been ongoing, with over 53,000 emergency workers and numerous international teams deployed to the area. However, poor weather conditions and damaged infrastructure have hindered these efforts. The government has also pledged to provide compensation to those who have lost their homes. The text describes widespread destruction in several Turkish cities, including Adana, Malatya, and Gaziantep, due to earthquakes. In Adana, many buildings were destroyed or damaged, and recovery efforts uncovered human remains. Malatya suffered extensive damage, with over 300 buildings destroyed and 60% of its structures damaged. Many mosques and two hotels also collapsed, and the airport ceiling caved in. In Gaziantep, numerous historical sites were severely damaged, and over 16,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The city's airport had to restrict flights to rescue missions. Hatay Province experienced significant damage, with over 13,000 buildings collapsing and many cultural sites destroyed. A large fire at İskenderun's port, possibly caused by a container of flammable industrial oil, also occurred. The country's main stock market dropped 1.35 percent on 6 February. The Borsa Istanbul fell 8.6 percent on 7 February, and declined by more than 7 percent on the morning of 8 February before trading was suspended; the exchange then announced it would close for five days. Total cost of earthquake damage in Turkey was estimated by TÜRKONFED at $84.1 billion US dollars; $70.75 billion on rebuilding, $10.4 billion loss in national income, and an additional $2.91 billion loss in workforce. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said rebuilding would cost $105 billion. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said potential losses may be up to 1 percent of Turkey's GDP in 2023. The Turkish government released a preliminary report estimating the total damage cost at $103.6 billion; corresponding to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023. About half of residential property in the affected area is thought to be covered by Compulsory Earthquake Insurance.. The United Nations Development Programme estimated between 116 million and 210 million tons of debris must be cleared in Turkey. The volume of building debris was estimated at 100 million m3 (3.5 billion cu ft); greater than any recent natural disaster. The amount is 10 times that produced during the 2010 Haiti earthquake.In Syria, the World Bank estimated $5.1 billion in damages, excluding economic impact and losses. Nearly half the cost was direct damage to residential buildings and 18 percent on infrastructure. Aleppo Governate, the worst-affected governate, accounted for 45 percent of the damage cost (equivalent to about $2.3 billion), followed by Idlib and Lattakia governates.

In Gaziantep, people sought refuge in shopping malls, stadiums, community centers, and mosques. Nearly 250,000 displaced persons resided in schools across Malatya Province. At least 24 mobile kitchens from vocational schools in the province were distributed across the affected areas.Several Turkish humanitarian institutions such as Ahbap from Haluk Levent, the Turkish Philanthropy Funds (US-based), and Turkish Red Crescent (besides other IFRC members around the world) also launched emergency appeals to help the victims.. Turkish Airlines said it would provide free flights from the provinces of Adana, Adıyaman, Gaziantep, Kayseri, Diyarbakır, Şanlıurfa, Malatya, Elazığ and Kahramanmaraş. The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority opened an invitation for citizen volunteers to help with rescue efforts in the affected area. Thousands of volunteers arrived at Istanbul Airport. Bilal Ekşi, CEO of Turkish Airlines, said it has flown 11,780 volunteers on 80 flights to Adana, Gaziantep, Adiyaman and Şanlıurfa.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Twitter, "search and rescue teams were immediately dispatched" to the affected area. Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu urged residents to refrain from entering damaged buildings. The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research said there was a possible link between the beaching and earthquake as these whales' echolocation system are affected by sea disturbances.The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said shaking was felt in Armenia, Egypt, Palestine, Georgia, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Russia. In Iraq, minor damage occurred in some houses and buildings in Erbil, and the city's citadel was severely damaged. In Egypt, tremors were strongly felt in the capital Cairo, and is considered the strongest earthquake felt since 1975. A 20 m (66 ft) crack appeared in the Corniche in Alexandria. Aftershocks. On 20 February, a Mww 6.3 aftershock struck near Antakya, causing additional buildings to collapse in Samandağ and further damage in Antakya. Six people died in Antakya, Defne and Samandağ.

The text describes widespread destruction in several Turkish cities, including Adana, Malatya, and Gaziantep, due to earthquakes. In Adana, many buildings were destroyed or damaged, and recovery efforts uncovered human remains. Malatya suffered extensive damage, with over 300 buildings destroyed and 60% of its structures damaged. Many mosques and two hotels also collapsed, and the airport ceiling caved in. In Gaziantep, numerous historical sites were severely damaged, and over 16,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The city's airport had to restrict flights to rescue missions. Hatay Province experienced significant damage, with over 13,000 buildings collapsing and many cultural sites destroyed. A large fire at İskenderun's port, possibly caused by a container of flammable industrial oil, also occurred. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as "disaster areas".A week after the earthquakes in Samandağ, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. "We have nothing left and the government barely helped us," one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary "because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes," The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would "only cause more death." Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey's opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1, and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council. In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ's statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over "provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozdağ, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozdağ said: "Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the "Earthquake Crimes Investigation" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for "spreading misinformation" or for ""provoking the people into animosity and hatred" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozdağ said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed. A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. In the aftermath of the earthquake in Hatay Province, Reyhanlı, Arsuz, Kumlu, and Payas experienced significant building damage, with many collapsing and requiring demolition. İskenderun was hit particularly hard, with a large fire at the port causing extensive damage and hindering operations. The city also saw numerous building collapses, severe damage, and fatalities. Other districts such as Erzin, Samandağ, Hassa, Altınözü, Yayladağı, Belen, and Dörtyol also suffered building damage and loss of life. Mass burials took place in Kahramanmaraş, and many buildings were destroyed in Adıyaman Province, including four neighborhoods in the city of Adıyaman. Other areas such as Elbistan, Ekinözü, Afşin, Ericek, Nurhak, and Türkoğlu also experienced significant damage and loss of life. "We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground," said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw 7. However, professor Hasan Sözbilir, Director of Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw 7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw 6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 İzmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdoğan had claimed "98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999" and described it "as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement". Erdoğan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuoğlu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdoğan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmaraş, were used to dispute Erdoğan's claim.In Adıyaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailoğlu, and governor, Mahmut Çuhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdoğan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdoğan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdoğan said "We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty," In another video, he said "We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Adıyaman; 14,719 in Diyarbakır; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmaraş; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in Şanlıurfa. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown.

After an earthquake in Syria, humanitarian aid started entering the country on February 9 via Turkey. The US temporarily lifted sanctions related to earthquake relief for 180 days. Some argue that sanctions do not hinder aid delivery. The Syrian government opened border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Raée for three months. International organizations like the UN, EU, ASEAN, NATO, and the World Bank have offered assistance. The Turkish government faced criticism for allegedly covering up the extent of the disaster. The UN released funds for humanitarian aid in Turkey and Syria and appealed for additional funds for Syria. The World Bank pledged US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey. The main stock market in the country experienced a drop of 1.35% on February 6, while the Borsa Istanbul fell by 8.6% on February 7 and was suspended after declining more than 7% on February 8. The exchange announced a five-day closure. The cost of earthquake damage in Turkey is estimated to be $84.1 billion, with $70.75 billion needed for rebuilding, $10.4 billion in lost national income, and an additional $2.91 billion in workforce losses. The Turkish government's preliminary report estimated the total damage cost at $103.6 billion, equivalent to 9% of its GDP in 2023. In Syria, the World Bank estimated $5.1 billion in damages, with nearly half on residential buildings and 18% on infrastructure. The reconstruction cost is estimated at $7.9 billion, with the economy potentially contracting by up to 5.5% in 2023. Thousands were trapped under rubble in Turkey, and many were left homeless. Officials opened hotels and schools for temporary accommodation. Mosques, shopping malls, stadiums, and community centers were used as shelters. Turkish humanitarian institutions and airlines launched emergency appeals and provided free flights for victims and volunteers. The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority opened an invitation for citizen volunteers. Search and rescue teams were immediately dispatched to the affected area, and residents were urged to avoid entering damaged buildings. The World Bank is providing aid and assessing the urgent needs following the earthquakes in Turkey, which is facing criticism for allegedly covering up the facts about the mainshocks and manipulating the death toll. The Turkish government has been accused of inadequately enforcing building codes, leading to the collapse of many buildings, including newly constructed ones. Critics also accuse the government of allowing contractors to bypass safety measures in housing projects, which they claim has put residents at risk. Satellite imagery and the opinions of experts contradict the government's claims about the age of the destroyed buildings. Protests have erupted in some areas, and the opposition leader has accused the president of being responsible for the disaster's scale. After the devastating earthquake in Turkey, investigations were initiated for spreading misinformation and inciting hatred. Arrests were made in connection with negligent inspections, cutting down columns, and violating building codes. National mourning was declared in Turkey, Northern Cyprus, Bangladesh, and Kosovo. Criticism arose regarding corruption in Turkey's construction sector, and the Syrian government and opposition blamed each other for obstructing aid. The Syrian government accused Western sanctions for the lack of humanitarian aid, while the US Treasury claimed otherwise. The UN was criticized for focusing aid solely on the regime, neglecting opposition-held territories.

The earthquake caused extensive damage to buildings, and thousands of people were left homeless in Aleppo, Idlib, and other regions. A prison facility in Rajo was also affected. Three Turkish soldiers died during rescue operations. Twenty-six local journalists, four doctors, 120 police officers and 32 gendarmeries were among the dead. In Syria. At least 8,476 people died and over 14,500 were injured in Syria. Among the dead included 2,153 children and 1,524 women. The Syrian Ministry of Health recorded over 2,248 earthquake-related deaths and 2,950 injuries in government held areas, most of which were in the governorates of Aleppo and Latakia. In rebel-held areas, at least 4,547 people died and 2,200 others were injured. The Syrian Network for Human Rights stated 73 medics, five media personnel, 62 workers in humanitarian agencies, and four civil defense personnel were among the dead. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said additional dead were buried before being registered and some victims died in hospitals. Syria's National Earthquake Centre said the earthquake is "the biggest earthquake recorded" in its operational history.An estimated 5.37 million people across Syria may have been made homeless, while 10.9 million people, nearly half of Syria's population, were affected. More than 123 residential areas, villages, towns and cities were badly damaged. Many power plants, water facilities, hospitals and public infrastructure also sustained damage. At least 453 schools were damaged. A total of 10,600 buildings had partially or fully collapsed, while thousands of others were damaged in the country.Hundreds were killed in the towns of Jindires and Atarib. In Jableh, at least 283 people died, 173 were injured and 19 buildings collapsed. Four bodies were recovered and 15 bodies were in the process of recovery during debris clearance on 10 February. On 11 February, six bodies were retrieved from the rubble of a collapsed house along al-Maliyeh Street. Civilians were stuck under the rubble for hours due to the lack of rescue teams in several villages such as Atarib, Besnia, Jindires, Maland, Salqin and Sarmada. In Latakia Governorate, 142,000 people were affected; at least 805 people died and 1,131 others were injured. The region's governor said 105 buildings were destroyed, 247 were at risk of collapse and 900 others were severely damaged. At Tishreen University, 10 students, 3 employees and a professor died. At least 48 people were killed in Hama, of which 43 were from the collapse of an eight-story building.The Associated Press, citing local residents, said the Afrin Dam had cracked. On 9 February at 04:00, the dam burst and flooded the village of Al-Tloul, which was exacerbated by heavy rains along the Afrin River basin. Nearly all its residents fled; about 500 families were displaced. According to Reuters, citing local residents, between 35 and 40 people died and most buildings in Al-Tloul were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. In Atarib, 148 bodies arrived at an underground hospital. A doctor at the hospital said some bodies were missing their head or limbs. Various archaeological sites in Tartus Governorate were damaged, including the Khawabi Castle and Aleika Castle, which partially collapsed. Damage to historical towers and infrastructure were also reported in Tartous and Safita.The president of the Syrian American Medical Society, Amjad Rass, said emergency rooms were packed with injured. In Idlib Governorate, one hospital received 30 bodies. In the village of Azmarin, Idlib Governorate, at least 260 people died, including 51 members of one family; at least 300 were injured and 100 were rescued. Fifteen buildings in the village were leveled and about 50 percent of its housing stock had cracks.

About 20,000 homes were affected in Aleppo, leaving 70,000 homeless. In Rajo, the doors and walls of a prison facility cracked. The text describes the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Syria and surrounding countries. In Syria, the earthquake caused further damage to buildings already weakened by the country's ongoing civil war. Notable damage occurred in Aleppo, where many buildings collapsed and over 400 people died, and in the ancient castles of Margat, Krak des Chevaliers, and Sahyun. In addition, the earthquake caused extensive damage in southern Turkey, resulting in the deaths of at least 6,600 Syrian refugees and 11 Iraqi war refugees. The earthquake also caused damage in Lebanon, Israel, and Cyprus, and was felt as far away as Egypt, Iraq, and Russia. Aftershocks, including a Mww 6.3 tremor on February 20, caused further damage and loss of life in Turkey. The disaster resulted in significant loss of life and property, as well as displacement of people in the affected regions. The text describes the destruction caused by earthquakes in several provinces in Turkey and Syria. In Adıyaman, four neighborhoods were destroyed, including the city hall, a 6th-century mosque, a hospital, and a hotel, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Other districts in Adıyaman and in Diyarbakir, Şanlıurfa, Osmaniye, Kilis, Batman, Mardin, Bingöl, Samsun, Kayseri, Muş, Sivas, and Giresun provinces also experienced significant damage and loss of life. In Syria, at least 8,476 people died and over 14,500 were injured, with a high number of children and women among the casualties. The Syrian Ministry of Health and various human rights organizations have recorded deaths and injuries in both government-held and rebel-held areas. The text also notes the deaths of several notable individuals, including a member of the Turkish parliament, a soccer player, a former national handball team player and his son, a community leader, a former MP, and several rescue workers, journalists, doctors, and police officers.

The text describes the aftermath of a severe earthquake in Turkey, with a maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of X (Extreme) along the fault rupture, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Geological effects such as liquefaction, lateral spreading, subsidence, and flooding were observed in various areas, including Antakya, Samandağ, Lake Gölbaşı, and İskenderun. A tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, with small waves reaching the coasts of Cyprus, İskenderun, and Erdemli. The earthquake resulted in over 50,000 deaths, thousands of injuries, and millions of people affected across 11 provinces in Turkey. Approximately 345,000 apartments were destroyed, and over 2 million residents were evacuated. The disaster also caused significant damage to agricultural production, infrastructure, and university buildings. A damage assessment revealed that at least 61,722 buildings needed to be demolished, and many roads showed broad fissures. In Adana and Malatya, hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, with numerous casualties reported. After the earthquake in Turkey, prisoners demanded to see their families affected by the disaster. Rescue operations by German and Austrian teams were halted due to worsening security but resumed with protection from the Turkish military. The Israeli rescue team left due to a specific threat. A family of seven Syrian refugees died in a fire, and a gas explosion in Şanlıurfa killed two. A bus collision killed two earthquake survivors. An IF1 tornado at a camp for earthquake victims killed three and injured 50. Floods in Adıyaman and Şanlıurfa killed at least 14. Elections planned for May 2023 faced uncertainty, with some calling for a delay, but the AKP later stated they would not be postponed. The earthquake caused the main opposition coalition to delay their meeting for selecting a presidential candidate. Education and sports were suspended in the affected provinces. The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research said there was a possible link between the beaching and earthquake as these whales' echolocation system are affected by sea disturbances.The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said shaking was felt in Armenia, Egypt, Palestine, Georgia, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Russia. In Iraq, minor damage occurred in some houses and buildings in Erbil, and the city's citadel was severely damaged. In Egypt, tremors were strongly felt in the capital Cairo, and is considered the strongest earthquake felt since 1975. A 20 m (66 ft) crack appeared in the Corniche in Alexandria. Aftershocks. On 20 February, a Mww 6.3 aftershock struck near Antakya, causing additional buildings to collapse in Samandağ and further damage in Antakya. Six people died in Antakya, Defne and Samandağ. At least 562 were injured including 18 in serious condition who received immediate medical attention before being taken to Adana and Dörtyol. AFAD warned residents to stay away from the coast as there was potential for a tsunami of up to 50 cm (20 in). The mayor of Hatay said several people were trapped under debris. A bridge was damaged and an empty three-story building in İskenderun collapsed. In Syria, five people died during stampedes and panic across several governates and at least 500 people were injured. The White Helmets said people in Aleppo and Idlib were injured by collapsed buildings. Some residents in Jinderis were injured after leaping off buildings. In northwestern Syria, damaged and abandoned buildings collapsed without casualties. Shaking was felt in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.A Mww 5.2 aftershock occurred on 27 February, near Yeşilyurt. It collapsed about 30 buildings in the town. Two people died and 140 others were injured; 12 in serious condition. One fatality and four injuries were attributed to a factory collapse in Kahramanmaraş Province. Estimations of losses. The USGS Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) service estimated a 35 percent probability of economic losses between US$10 billion and US$100 billion. There was a 34 percent probability of economic losses exceeding US$100 billion. The service estimated a 36 percent probability of deaths between 10,000 and 100,000; 26 percent probability of deaths exceeding 100,000. For the second large earthquake, there was a 46 percent probability of deaths between 1,000 and 10,000; 30 percent probability of deaths between 100 and 1,000. The service also estimated a 35 percent percent probability of economic losses between US$1 billion and US$10 billion; 27 percent probability of economic losses between US$10 billion and US$100 billion.Risklayer estimated a death toll of between 23,284 and 105,671. According to geophysics professor, Övgün Ahmet Ercan, "180,000 people or more may be trapped under the rubble, nearly all of them dead." On 11 February, when the death toll was reported at about 28,000, United Nations emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths said the death toll was expected to "more than double". The World Health Organization said up to 26 million people may have been affected; 15 million in Turkey and 11 million in Syria.Immediately after the earthquakes the Turkish lira value struck a record low of 18.85 against the US dollar, but rebounded to its starting position at the end of the day. Turkish stock markets fell; main equities benchmark fell as much as 5 percent and banks fell 5.5 percent but recovered from the losses. The country's main stock market dropped 1.35 percent on 6 February. The Borsa Istanbul fell 8.6 percent on 7 February, and declined by more than 7 percent on the morning of 8 February before trading was suspended; the exchange then announced it would close for five days. Total cost of earthquake damage in Turkey was estimated by TÜRKONFED at $84.1 billion US dollars; $70.75 billion on rebuilding, $10.4 billion loss in national income, and an additional $2.91 billion loss in workforce. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said rebuilding would cost $105 billion. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said potential losses may be up to 1 percent of Turkey's GDP in 2023. The Turkish government released a preliminary report estimating the total damage cost at $103.6 billion; corresponding to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023. The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research suggested a link between a recent earthquake and beached whales due to their echolocation systems being affected by sea disturbances. This earthquake caused shaking felt in several countries, including Iraq and Egypt, where damage to buildings and infrastructure was reported. Aftershocks followed, including a Mww 6.3 aftershock in Antakya and a Mww 5.2 aftershock in Yeşilyurt, resulting in further damage and casualties. The USGS PAGER service and Risklayer estimated significant potential economic losses and a high death toll. The earthquake also had a severe impact on Turkish financial markets, with the lira and stock markets falling sharply. The total cost of earthquake damage in Turkey is estimated to be around $84.1 billion US dollars, according to TÜRKONFED, and $103.6 billion according to the Turkish government, which corresponds to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023.

There were 25 aftershocks Mw 4.0 or greater recorded within six hours of the main tremor, according to the USGS. More than 12 hours later, the USGS had reported at least 54 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude, while the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) recorded at least 120 total aftershocks. A Mww 6.3 aftershock struck near Uzunbağ in Hatay Province on 20 February; the earthquake was the result of oblique-normal faulting. The Mw  7.8 earthquake had aftershocks distributed along ~350 km (220 mi) of the EAF.The Mw 7.7 earthquake triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two mb 6.0 aftershocks. Aftershocks of the second earthquake continued through at least 9 Feb. Thousands of aftershocks associated with this earthquake were distributed along an east-west trend corresponding to the Çardak Fault for about 170 km (110 mi). Seismology. A source model for the Mww 7.8 earthquake produced by the USGS from observed seismic waves, taking into account preliminary rupture mapping from satellite data, uses three fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >40 km (25 mi) × 30 km (19 mi), 028°/85° (Segment 1), >175 km (109 mi) × 30 km (19 mi), 060°/85° (Segment 2) and >160 km (99 mi) × 20 km (12 mi), 025°/75° (Segment 3). The mainshock produced a maximum slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2, beneath Sakarya in Kahramanmaraş Province, northeast of the junction where it meets Segment 1. Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Adıyaman.The USGS source model for the Mw 7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70 km (43 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 276°/80° (Segment 1), >40 km (25 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 250°/80° (Segment 2) and ~80 km (50 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 060°/80° (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4 m (37 ft).Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw  7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarcık and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370 km (230 mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of 9 m (30 ft) along the Pazarcık segment. The northern end of the rupture was about 20–30 km (12–19 mi) south of the Mw  6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the Pütürge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12 m (39 ft) from the surface to 7 km (4.3 mi) depth during the Mw  7.7 earthquake; slip was 11 m (36 ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact—mostly confined to within the Çardak Fault; it was also shallower—attenuating from 8–12 km (5.0–7.5 mi). Slip during the Mw  7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw  7.7 event. The Mw  6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25 km (16 mi) × 25 km (16 mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth.Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the Çardak–Sürgü Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that is was already close to failure. "We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground," said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw 7. However, professor Hasan Sözbilir, Director of Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw 7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw 6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 İzmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdoğan had claimed "98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999" and described it "as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement". Erdoğan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuoğlu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdoğan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmaraş, were used to dispute Erdoğan's claim.In Adıyaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailoğlu, and governor, Mahmut Çuhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdoğan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdoğan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdoğan said "We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty," In another video, he said "We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Adıyaman; 14,719 in Diyarbakır; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmaraş; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in Şanlıurfa. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prisoners were demanding to see their families affected by the earthquake.On 11 February, German and Austrian rescuers deployed to Hatay suspended operations, citing a worsening security situation due to the slow arrival of aid or sporadic clashes between armed groups. The teams later resumed operations when the Turkish Land Forces provided protection. On 12 February, rescuers from the Israeli search-and-rescue group United Hatzalah left Turkey, citing "intelligence of a concrete and immediate threat on the Israeli delegation".On 17 February, a Syrian family of seven, including five children, were killed during a fire that struck a home in Nurdağı, Turkey, in which they moved to after surviving the earthquake. Seven other people were injured during the fire. A natural gas explosion at a building in Şanlıurfa on 20 February killed two, left five injured and damaged businesses. Şanlıurfa's governor, Salih Ayhan, said due to the earthquakes, gas supply to the city was cut and an investigation was ongoing. A bus ferrying earthquake survivors from Hatay to Konya collided with a truck on the Tarsus-Adana-Gaziantep Motorway on 23 February, killing two and injuring six.On 20 April, an IF1 tornado struck a camp housing people affected by the earthquake in Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş; three people died and 50 others were injured. Floods. Floods which struck the provinces of Adıyaman and Şanlıurfa in March killed at least 14 people. On March 15, Turkey's interior minister Suleyman Soylu said five people were missing. The floods swept away cars, affected homes and campsites housing earthquake survivors. Twelve people, including five Syrians, died in Şanlıurfa. An intensive care unit in a hospital in the province was evacuated. In Adıyaman, two drowning deaths occurred when floodwaters swept away a container home with a family. Over a dozen professional divers participated in search and rescue efforts in each province. 2023 elections. Before the earthquake, the government had planned the elections to be held on 14 May 2023, a month earlier than its latest possible date as a snap election. After the earthquake, doubts arose if elections could be held on schedule. On 13 February, Bülent Arınç of the AKP demanded the elections be postponed despite the constitution disallowing such a possibility in the absence of war. Arınç's declaration has been criticized by media outlets and politicians. It remains to be seen whether the governing coalition, with its 333 seats in parliament, can surpass the 400-number hurdle needed to pass such proposals by changing the constitution. On 18 February, AKP authorities stated that the elections would not be delayed.Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the CHP opposed its postponement on constitutional grounds. Mustafa Tolga Öztürk, YSK member of the İYİ party stated that YSK does not have any power to postpone an election and only parliament has the right to do so, adding that Turkey had no more time to lose with the AKP. Selahattin Demirtaş of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) has described the postponement as a political coup. The declaration of state of emergency in the affected regions was also interpreted as a possible measure to postpone elections. Nevertheless, the earthquake led to the main anti-Erdoğan coalition postponing its 13 February meeting for the selection of its consensus presidential candidate to 6 March.At the elections, the Erdoğan-lead elecotral People's Alliance retained its majority in the Grand National Assembly, while Erdoğan in the first round of the presidential election received 49.5% with 52.2% in the second one against Kılıçdaroğlu. This marked the first time a Turkish presidential election went into a run-off. Education. On 9 February, the Council of Higher Education said education and training at universities in the affected provinces would be suspended until further notice. Student hostels managed by the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels would be used to house affected individuals. The minister of national education, Mahmut Özer, ordered a week-long closure of all schools in the country, which was later extended to two weeks. Schools in the affected provinces were suspended until 10 March. Students studying in schools located in the affected provinces would be transferred to other provinces of their choice. Sports. After the earthquake, Süper Lig was suspended for over a week to mourn the victims. The Pazarcık and Amanos segments in the west have recurrence intervals of 237–772 years and 414–917 years, respectively, for M 7.0–7.4 earthquakes. A research paper published by Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2002 studied stress accumulation and increased seismic hazard along the East Anatolian Fault. The study concluded two sections of the fault with considerably high potential for future earthquakes. One of these sections was in Elazığ and Bingöl, located between the rupture zones of the 1874 and 1971 earthquakes. The seismic gap ruptured during a Mw  6.1 earthquake in 2010. The 2020 Mw  6.8 earthquake ruptured to the southwest between the 1893/1905 and 1874 earthquakes. Another seismic gap was located in Kahramanmaraş—this 103 km (64 mi) long section—according to the study, believed to last rupture in 1513 has the potential to produce magnitude 7.3 earthquakes.Large earthquakes on the northern part of the DST include events in 115, 526, 587, 1138, 1170 and 1822, which resulted in several tens of thousands to several hundreds of thousands of fatalities. Earthquake sequence. The first and largest earthquake in the sequence struck at 01:17 UTC. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) measured it at Mww 7.8 and Mw 7.8, respectively. GEOSCOPE reported Mw 8.0 and Kandilli Observatory (KOERI) reported Mw 7.7 and ML 7.4. It had an epicenter at 37.166°N 37.032°E﻿ / 37.166; 37.032, 34 km (21 mi) west of Gaziantep in Gaziantep Province, which is near the border with Syria. The earthquake hypocenter was at a depth of 10.0 km (6 mi) according to USGS and 5 km (3 mi) according to KOERI. The shock had a focal mechanism corresponding to strike-slip faulting.It is one of the strongest ever recorded in Turkey, equivalent in magnitude to the 1939 Erzincan earthquake (Mw 7.8). These earthquakes are surpassed only by the larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake. Globally it was the strongest recorded since August 2021. Both earthquakes are the largest and only observed to occur on land and within a short span of time. At 10:24 UTC, an earthquake measuring Mww 7.5 according to USGS, Mw 7.6 according to KOERI, or Mw 7.7 according to Geoscope and the GCMT, struck with an epicenter near Ekinözü, 95 km northeast of the M7.8 event. It had a depth of 7.4 km (5 mi) according to the USGS, 5 km (3 mi) by KOERI, and 13 km (8 mi) by Geoscope.A reevaluation of the earthquakes using long-period coda moment magnitude obtained moment magnitudes of Mw  7.95 ± 0.013 and Mw  7.86 ± 0.012, respectively. These earthquakes were the largest Turkish earthquakes in over 2,000 years. Aftershocks. Over 570 aftershocks were recorded within 24 hours of the Mw 7.8 earthquake and over 30,000 recorded by May 2023. An aftershock measuring Mww 6.7 occurred about 11 minutes after the mainshock. There were 25 aftershocks Mw 4.0 or greater recorded within six hours of the main tremor, according to the USGS. More than 12 hours later, the USGS had reported at least 54 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude, while the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) recorded at least 120 total aftershocks. A Mww 6.3 aftershock struck near Uzunbağ in Hatay Province on 20 February; the earthquake was the result of oblique-normal faulting. The Mw  7.8 earthquake had aftershocks distributed along ~350 km (220 mi) of the EAF.The Mw 7.7 earthquake triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two mb 6.0 aftershocks. Aftershocks of the second earthquake continued through at least 9 Feb.

The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdoğan had claimed "98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999" and described it "as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement". Erdoğan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuoğlu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdoğan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmaraş, were used to dispute Erdoğan's claim.In Adıyaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailoğlu, and governor, Mahmut Çuhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdoğan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdoğan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdoğan said "We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty," In another video, he said "We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Adıyaman; 14,719 in Diyarbakır; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmaraş; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in Şanlıurfa. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. After a series of earthquakes in Samandağ, residents were left to search for victims due to a slow and insufficient government response. The government faced criticism for limiting access to Twitter and imposing fines and suspensions on media outlets covering the disaster. Authorities arrested individuals for "provocative posts" on social media and for looting, with Syrian refugees being particularly targeted and facing discrimination. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees have been reported. A judicial investigation has been initiated to hold accountable those responsible for building collapses, resulting in arrests and investigations of contractors, surveyors, and experts. Journalists have been detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as "disaster areas".A week after the earthquakes in Samandağ, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. "We have nothing left and the government barely helped us," one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary "because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes," The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would "only cause more death." Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey's opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1, and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council. In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ's statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over "provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozdağ, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozdağ said: "Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the "Earthquake Crimes Investigation" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for "spreading misinformation" or for ""provoking the people into animosity and hatred" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozdağ said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed. A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an "earthquake tax" (officially "special communications tax") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; £3.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. İsmail Palakoğlu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbakır Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as "disaster areas".A week after the earthquakes in Samandağ, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. "We have nothing left and the government barely helped us," one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media.

After an earthquake in Syria, humanitarian aid started entering the country on February 9 via Turkey. The US temporarily lifted sanctions related to earthquake relief for 180 days. Some argue that sanctions do not hinder aid delivery. The Syrian government opened border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Raée for three months. International organizations like the UN, EU, ASEAN, NATO, and the World Bank have offered assistance. The Turkish government faced criticism for allegedly covering up the extent of the disaster. The UN released funds for humanitarian aid in Turkey and Syria and appealed for additional funds for Syria. The World Bank pledged US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey. Secretary General António Guterres urged the Security Council to immediately permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria. United States appealed for the immediate opening of all closed checkpoints to send in relief efforts to all parts of Syria; calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase humanitarian assistance through Bab al-Hawa and open up more border crossings for the entry of UN aid. Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesperson, said on 14 February, "some aid is getting into the north-west, pointing to 58 trucks that arrived with aid through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing." However, the organization does not possess heavy equipment or search and rescue teams. He stressed that the "international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.". Raed al-Saleh, chief of Syrian Civil Defence, strongly rebuked the UN for its negligence and delay in responding to the rescue efforts:"Let me be clear: The White Helmets received no support from the United Nations during the most critical moments of the rescue operations.. The UN's failure to respond quickly to this catastrophe is shameful. When I asked the UN why help had failed to arrive in time, the answer I received was bureaucracy. In the face of one of the deadliest catastrophes to strike the world in years, it seems the UN's hands were tied by red tape." Health concerns. Due to below-freezing temperatures in the affected areas in both Turkey and Syria, the mayor of Hatay, Lütfü Savaş, warned about the hypothermia risk. In Adiyaman Province, some residents trapped under rubble died from hypothermia.Concerns arose regarding the possible spread of infection in areas where sanitation facilities were damaged or unfunctional. Due to water shortage experienced in both countries, many survivors could not shower. International health organizations said the shortage of clean water would be a public health risk. The World Health Organization said water shortage "increases the risk of waterborne diseases and outbreaks of communicable diseases."On 18 February, Turkey's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said there was an increase in intestinal and upper respiratory infection cases but "numbers did not pose a serious threat to public health." At a stadium serving as shelter in Kahramanmaraş, a clinic managed by 15 to 30 medics attended up to 10,000 patients in the day. The clinic provided tetanus shots and sanitary items to residents. Many people at the stadium were unable to shower and the six toilets were unable to accommodate to the large number of people. In Antakya, residents said more portable toilets were needed.Health authorities in Turkey had to ensure earthquake survivors were free of disease. The World Health Organization collaborated with local authorities to monitor the rates of waterborne diseases, seasonal influenza and COVID-19 among the affected. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, has urged the Security Council to quickly allow humanitarian aid into northwestern Syria. The US has called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase aid through Bab al-Hawa and open more border crossings. The UN has sent some aid through Bab Al-Hawa, but the organization has not provided heavy equipment or search and rescue teams. Raed al-Saleh, head of the Syrian Civil Defence, has criticized the UN for its slow response to the crisis. There are also concerns about the spread of disease in both Turkey and Syria due to damaged sanitation facilities and water shortages. The World Health Organization is working with local authorities in Turkey to monitor the rates of waterborne diseases, seasonal flu, and COVID-19 among the affected. After the devastating earthquake in Turkey, investigations were initiated for spreading misinformation and inciting hatred. Arrests were made in connection with negligent inspections, cutting down columns, and violating building codes. National mourning was declared in Turkey, Northern Cyprus, Bangladesh, and Kosovo. Criticism arose regarding corruption in Turkey's construction sector, and the Syrian government and opposition blamed each other for obstructing aid. The Syrian government accused Western sanctions for the lack of humanitarian aid, while the US Treasury claimed otherwise. The UN was criticized for focusing aid solely on the regime, neglecting opposition-held territories. The Idlib region, under the control of the Syrian Salvation Government, was one of the hardest-hit areas. Aid convoys from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria were blocked from entering the north-west region. The UN urged the Security Council to permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria, and the US called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase humanitarian assistance.

The text describes a rugby player named List who played for various teams in the Auckland Rugby League during the 1931 season. List scored tries and prevented heavier defeats for his teams, with his performance being praised as "brilliant in patches" and "strenuous and consistent". He was known for his defensive work and ability to break through the opposition's defense. List's performance was crucial as his team, Kingsland, was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys due to a weakened competition and smaller crowds. After the merger, List scored tries and kicked drop goals for Marist, and his performance was praised as being close to representative honors. He was selected for the North Island team in their inter-island match against the South Island. Claude List was born in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia in 1902 to German-born Henry Wilschefski and English-born Mary Frances Carter. After Henry's death in 1903, Mary remarried Francis Martin List in 1907, who had also emigrated from Germany. Claude was the youngest of three children and gained five half-siblings from his mother's second marriage. The family moved to New Zealand between 1915 and 1919, living in Glen Eden by 1919. Claude started playing rugby league in Queensland at the age of 10 and continued in New Zealand, playing for Kingsland Rovers from 1921. He moved to the 2nd grade side in 1923 and won the 2nd grade knockout competition in 1924. He made his senior debut for Kingsland in the B Division in 1925, becoming one of the only players to gain selection for Auckland from that grade. He scored multiple tries in his first matches and was selected for the Auckland Junior representative side, playing on the wing and scoring a try in their win against Hamilton juniors. His successful 1925 season led to his selection for the national side in 1928, becoming the first ever player in New Zealand to be selected from a second division side. In 1934, List, a skilled footballer, had a tumultuous year with Marist due to financial disputes. He missed several matches but was later chosen as a reserve for the final game against South Auckland. After Bert Cooke's injury, List replaced him on the wing and scored a try, contributing to Auckland's victory. Following this, he played against St. George from Sydney and Richmond, marking Len Brennan and finishing the season with an unemployed charity match. Amidst the Great Depression, List transferred to Mount Albert United after falling out with Marist. He sat out several months due to a suspension, which was upheld by the New Zealand Rugby League. Later, he was granted a transfer to Mount Albert, along with several other suspended players. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the “best of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football”.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke's Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List's feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime “Hassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide” to give Auckland a 9–2 lead. The Auckland Star said “List did well when he came on for wing duty”. List had played in the curtain-raiser for Marist against Devonport in a challenge cup competition match and so ended up playing over 3 halves of football.Following a match against Ponsonby the Marist side played against the touring St. George side from Sydney who had finished runner up in the 1933 New South Wales rugby league competition. Before a crowd of 13,000 at Carlaw Park Marist won 25 to 11. List played on the wing and marked Len Brennan who was later killed in World War 2 aged just 32. He then finished the season with a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond and an unemployed charity match against the same opposition on October 21 as New Zealand was in the midst of the Great Depression. Falling out with Marist and transfer to Mount Albert. The 1934 was an unusual one for List. He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end. At the start of the season it was reported that he was available to play again but he was not named in their early season matches. Early in the season Marist were struggling for players with some playing for their reserve grade side and the senior side on the same day. List then came out of ‘retirement’ and had his season debut in their round 3 match against City Rovers on the same day the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park. They lost 18-5 and List was said to be “far from his best, judging by this exhibition”. He played better against Devonport a week later and scored a try in a 22–13 loss to Newton on May 26. However it was reported that he “played listlessly, his one real sparkle being the opportune try he obtained before the final whistle” on the left wing.It was then reported that there were several senior players at Marist who were in a dispute with the club over financial issues. They included C. Dunne, Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Wilf Hassan, brothers Len, Bill and John Schultz, and List. The club released an official statement on June 8 saying “that several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors…Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance…”. The eight players were then asked to appear at the club's executive meeting the following week.List was named in the reserves for a match on June 9 but did not play, and then most of the players were suspended by the Marist club. The Auckland Rugby League had declared that the suspensions were “out of order” but the Marist club appealed to New Zealand Rugby League and they upheld the suspensions. List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan. Mt Albert had been seeking senior grade status and they were allowed to enter a team in the Roope Rooster along with the Papakura club. Mount Albert lost the match 19–11 to Ponsonby on Carlaw Park #2 field on August 18.

Early in the second half he took a pass from Prentice and “accelerated the pace of the movement, and although hard pressed, got over at the flag with a couple of Canterbury backs clutching at him”. Then later in the match “a long kick saw List and Blazey have a great race for possession, the Aucklander winning by a touch”. The Herald said during the following week that “List was the outstanding back on the Auckland side, and his straight running and strong fending were very impressive. Coached on the right lines in the value of co-operating more with the wings, List will develop into a brilliant attacking centre three-quarter”.List returned to the Kingsland side for their match with Northcote. The 2 teams were leading the B Division competition with 2 matches remaining with Northcote holding a 1-point lead. Northcote won to seal the championship with Kingsland finishing runner up. The Herald said that “some good talent was hidden in the ranks of the B section teams. The ability of List, of Kingsland was cited, and it was contended that other players of equal merit only awaited a chance to make good”.List was then chosen for the Auckland side to play South Auckland side from the Waikato on October 9. Auckland won 25 to 8 before a small crowd of 3,000 at Carlaw Park. List scored 3 tries, the first coming after Allan Seagar dummied past opponents and “then passed to List, trailing in support, for the Kingsland centre to sail in unopposed”. A cross-kick by List then gave Wade on the wing a chance through his speed to gain possession and score under the posts. A while later Cleaver “gave a high reverse pass, and List, gathering the ball on the tips of his fingers, put the seal on a splendid bit of collaboration by diving across wide out”. Then with still time remaining in the first half he “made a great opening and sailed for the line with Cleaver and Seagar in support. Paki made a game effort to stop the raid, but the ball was sent on for Seagar to score a good try”. In the second half a passing movement saw List get the ball from Seagar and “racing on a diagonal line [he] crossed to score wide out”. The Herald said that “List was perhaps the best of the [Auckland] three-quarters, and his straight running made his play very impressive”.List then returned to his Kingsland side for their Stallard Cup knockout final match against Parnell on October 16. Kingsland won by 25 points to 13. List set up a try to Carter and “was playing a fine game for Kingsland… [he then] made a clever opening and again Carter scored”. 1927 North Island selection. The 1927 season saw List play 13 matches for Kingsland Rovers scoring 2 tries, although the B Division matches did not receive very good newspaper coverage so he may have scored more. Kingsland once again finished runner up, this time behind Ellerslie United. He played 5 games for Auckland, scoring 7 tries which was the most for the representative side. List also made his debut appearance for the North Island representative side.. His season began early, being selected on April 12 to go into training for the Auckland side to play the returning Auckland members of the New Zealand team from their England and Wales tour. The match was played at Carlaw Park on April 30 with the Auckland side winning 24-21 before a crowd of 14,000. List scored a try and the Auckland Star stated that “List, the Auckland centre was very brilliant in attack and his sharp burst of speed, allied to straight running, often penetrated deeply into the New Zealand defense. On the day he showed to greater advantage than B. Davidson…”. He “had every opportunity to do well, and his straight running and delightful swerving were good to watch”.This was the only representative match played by Auckland until near the end of the club season. List played 13 games for Kingsland from May 14 to September 3. In their second match which they won 11–3 against Otahuhu at the Otahuhu Trotting Ground he “gave another splendid exhibition, and he will give Davidson a good fight for the centre three-quarter position in the rep. team”. In their team list for their match against Mangere on May 28, Claude's younger brother Francis was also listed in the side with him. Following a 25–0 win over Otahuhu on July 9 the Auckland Star said “the best of the backs was without doubt List at centre. He was always there to seize an opportunity, and also put in some solid defence work. He scored a try in a practice match against Northcote on April 20 before Kingsland's opening match in first grade against City Rovers at Carlaw Park on April 27. Kingsland lost the match 21–6 with List scoring one of their two tries. The Herald said that “List was below form and passed wildly at times”. Against Devonport a week later at the Devonport Domain he “received the ball only on rare occasions, but gave a great defensive display” in a 29–7 loss. They lost to Newton 12–10 with List setting up R. Carter for a try. He “played well” in the match. Kingsland then secured their first championship point with a 18–18 draw against Marist Old Boys. List was the best of their backs along with Christmas and Angelo. Though the Auckland Star said “List, at centre, played wonderfully in the circumstances and appears to be striking good form”. In a heavy loss to Ponsonby List “got through an immeasurable amount of good work”. He then scored 2 tries in Kingsland's first win, by 17 points to 5 over Ellerslie. The Star said he was “outstanding, [and] played sufficiently deeply to be able to race up effectively and co-operate with Angelo and Nasey”. And that his second try “was a gem, a solo effort in swerving brilliance by which he cut out three defenders and the full-back”. He scored another try in a 13–8 loss to City though “lacked opportunities” but still played a great defensive game towards the end. The Herald criticised his play saying “List at centre three-quarter, is certainly a powerful runner, but it is surprising to see a player of his experience hold on to the ball after an opportunity is presented to the wing. Had List passed more often Kingsland may have won comfortably”. Against Devonport the following week he set up both of Kingsland's tries in an 18–8 loss.They then had their second win, 14–10 over Newton on June 29. He was “perhaps the best of the Kingsland backs, his powerful running paving the way for two tries”. He "had little difficulty in beating [Cyril] Brimble, whose defence was weak. The Kingsland centre played his best game this season but will find it difficult to obtain a place as centre in the representative team. With good inside backs List, as a wing, is one of the most dangerous scoring backs in the code”. He scored another try in their 25–10 loss to Marist, and played “like a rock” in a 9–0 defeat to Ponsonby.Then with Auckland representative selection looming List played a great game against Richmond with Kingsland winning 6–0. He scored after he “had taken the ball at his feet, from halfway, and just beat Grace in a spectacular dive”. He “played a sound game. His powerful running paved the way for both Kingsland’s tries”.List was then selected for Auckland to play against South Auckland on July 27. Auckland won 11–8 with List overshadowing his opposite, Jackways. He “was at his best in the first half, and his defensive play was excellent”. He set up Len Scott’s try after he fielded a high kick “splendidly”. Though the Herald said he “was not impressive at centre, throwing many wild passes to Scott and Mincham”. Returning to the Kingsland side List kicked a drop goal in a 19–7 win over Ellerslie. It was said “List’s play was a feature of the afternoon. He was always in the thick of play, his cutting in being brilliant, while he paved the way for two of Kingsland’s tries”.He was then picked in the Auckland Auckland training squad to prepare for a match against Northland before being chosen on the wing. He scored a try in Auckland's 22–19 win. “Carter and List, played brightly with limited opportunity and were conspicuous for determined dashes”. The Herald said that he “kicked altogether too much to be impressive. The Kingsland wing would be a good scoring player if he had confidence in his undoubted pace and strength”. He was chosen in the 22 man Auckland training squad to prepare for their match against Canterbury on August 24. He was ultimately picked in the side to play on the wing. Auckland won 47-18 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park with List scoring the home side's final try. The Herald said that “List showed more determination than in other matches and played really well”. The text describes a rugby player's (List) performance in various matches for his team, Kingsland. In the opening match against City Rovers, he scored one try but his performance was criticized. He improved in the following matches, with strong defensive play and set-ups for his team's tries. His performance was praised against Devonport, Newton, and Ellerslie, with notable tries and effective teamwork. However, his play was criticized in the match against Marist for holding onto the ball too long. He continued to play well in the remaining matches, with a standout performance against Richmond, leading to his selection for Auckland's representative team. He played on the wing and scored tries in matches against South Auckland, Northland, and Canterbury, with his performance in the latter match being particularly impressive. The Herald noted his determination and good play, but criticized his tendency to kick too much and his passing. Despite this, he was a valuable contributor to his team's success. He scored a try in Auckland's 22–19 win. “Carter and List, played brightly with limited opportunity and were conspicuous for determined dashes”. The Herald said that he “kicked altogether too much to be impressive. The Kingsland wing would be a good scoring player if he had confidence in his undoubted pace and strength”. He was chosen in the 22 man Auckland training squad to prepare for their match against Canterbury on August 24. He was ultimately picked in the side to play on the wing. Auckland won 47-18 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park with List scoring the home side's final try. The Herald said that “List showed more determination than in other matches and played really well”. His final match of the season was for Kingsland when they were eliminated in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition 9-3 by Marist. He “combined well in the three-quarter line [with Carter] and they were repeatedly conspicuous for strong running”. He failed to make the North Island side to play the South Island a week later.. The 1930 season saw List play 14 matches for Kingsland Athletic, and once again he scored 7 tries for them. This placed him equal ninth in the club try scoring list. He only played one match for Auckland out of their three matches. Prior to the start of the season in team previews the Auckland Star said “List is a steady and resolute exponent with plenty of experience”. Kingsland lost their opening game to Marist 16-13 but were awarded the victory as Marist had fielded an unregistered player. List was involved in much of Kingsland's attacking work. After their round 2 loss to Devonport List was selected in the 23 man training squad for Auckland's match with Northland. He then played for Kingsland against Newton on May 10 in a 14–8 loss. The Sun said that he “was on form, and his deadly fend proved a regular nightmare to some members of the opposition, but he failed to run straight, and gave his wingers insufficient room in which to work”.. List was then named on the wing for Auckland for their May 17 match with Northland. Auckland won the match 21-16 before a crowd of 8,000 at Carlaw Park. List had a rare poor game and “a weak attempt at tackling by him let Whitelaw, the visitor’s right winger, run rings around him”, resulting in a try to Dunn. The Auckland Star said “List by no means justified his selection”, he “was uncertain in his movements, dropped passes all to frequently, and did not prove a match for his vis-a-vis, Whitelaw”. The Sun said “neither List nor R. Carter was very impressive. List seemed to be right off his game. He has been so long at centre that he appeared to be at a loss to know what to do on the wing”.He was "again disappointing" in Kingsland's next match with Richmond on May 24. He “mishandled at times, but was given few real chances”. The New Zealand side was touring Australia later in the season so his poor form was relevant for further rep honours in 1930. He was then omitted from the Auckland side to play South Auckland on May 31 after having been named in a 20-man squad to train prior.List spent the remainder of the season in the maroon jersey of Kingsland. The following week he scored a try in a 31–10 loss to Ellerslie where he played well but had few opportunities. His play then turned around in a narrow 17–13 loss to City. He “struck his best form and was a tower of strength to his side. It was about his best exhibition this season”. Both he and Carter were “outstanding and were responsible to no mean extent for the showing made by their side”. List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13–6 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was “easily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards”. He “at centre, was brilliant in patches”. List then scored two tries in Kingsland's 13–5 win over Newton. He “gave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago”. The Sun said he “played a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday”. In a 18–16 loss to Ellerslie he scored a try and was involved with 2 others. His last two matches of the season came against City Rovers.

In 1934, List, a skilled footballer, had a tumultuous year with Marist due to financial disputes. He missed several matches but was later chosen as a reserve for the final game against South Auckland. After Bert Cooke's injury, List replaced him on the wing and scored a try, contributing to Auckland's victory. Following this, he played against St. George from Sydney and Richmond, marking Len Brennan and finishing the season with an unemployed charity match. Amidst the Great Depression, List transferred to Mount Albert United after falling out with Marist. He sat out several months due to a suspension, which was upheld by the New Zealand Rugby League. Later, he was granted a transfer to Mount Albert, along with several other suspended players. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the “best of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football”.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke's Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List's feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime “Hassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide” to give Auckland a 9–2 lead. The Auckland Star said “List did well when he came on for wing duty”. List had played in the curtain-raiser for Marist against Devonport in a challenge cup competition match and so ended up playing over 3 halves of football.Following a match against Ponsonby the Marist side played against the touring St. George side from Sydney who had finished runner up in the 1933 New South Wales rugby league competition. Before a crowd of 13,000 at Carlaw Park Marist won 25 to 11. List played on the wing and marked Len Brennan who was later killed in World War 2 aged just 32. He then finished the season with a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond and an unemployed charity match against the same opposition on October 21 as New Zealand was in the midst of the Great Depression. Falling out with Marist and transfer to Mount Albert. The 1934 was an unusual one for List. He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end. At the start of the season it was reported that he was available to play again but he was not named in their early season matches. Early in the season Marist were struggling for players with some playing for their reserve grade side and the senior side on the same day. List then came out of ‘retirement’ and had his season debut in their round 3 match against City Rovers on the same day the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park. They lost 18-5 and List was said to be “far from his best, judging by this exhibition”. He played better against Devonport a week later and scored a try in a 22–13 loss to Newton on May 26. However it was reported that he “played listlessly, his one real sparkle being the opportune try he obtained before the final whistle” on the left wing.It was then reported that there were several senior players at Marist who were in a dispute with the club over financial issues. They included C. Dunne, Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Wilf Hassan, brothers Len, Bill and John Schultz, and List. The club released an official statement on June 8 saying “that several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors…Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance…”. The eight players were then asked to appear at the club's executive meeting the following week.List was named in the reserves for a match on June 9 but did not play, and then most of the players were suspended by the Marist club. The Auckland Rugby League had declared that the suspensions were “out of order” but the Marist club appealed to New Zealand Rugby League and they upheld the suspensions. List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan. Mt Albert had been seeking senior grade status and they were allowed to enter a team in the Roope Rooster along with the Papakura club. Mount Albert lost the match 19–11 to Ponsonby on Carlaw Park #2 field on August 18. The text describes a rugby player named List who played for various teams in the Auckland Rugby League during the 1931 season. List scored tries and prevented heavier defeats for his teams, with his performance being praised as "brilliant in patches" and "strenuous and consistent". He was known for his defensive work and ability to break through the opposition's defense. List's performance was crucial as his team, Kingsland, was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys due to a weakened competition and smaller crowds. After the merger, List scored tries and kicked drop goals for Marist, and his performance was praised as being close to representative honors. He was selected for the North Island team in their inter-island match against the South Island. In 1933, List, a center for Marist, played 21 matches and scored 6 tries, along with 1 conversion. He also played 3 matches for Auckland and scored a try, which were his final representative matches. Despite his declining performance, List was selected for Auckland's matches against Taranaki and South Auckland, where he was criticized for his poor passing and ball handling. However, he improved in Marist's matches, scoring 5 tries in 2 games. He was later chosen as a reserve for Auckland's final match against South Auckland, where he replaced Bert Cooke and scored a try. Marist finished as runner-up in the championship and Challenge Cup competition.

In a series of rugby matches in August 1928, a player named List gained significant recognition. Despite playing for a second division club, List was selected for the New Zealand side to make his national debut against England in the first test. He scored a try in the 17-13 win, which was a major upset. List was chosen for his impressive performance, even though he had previously been criticized for passing infield to Dixon when Scott was unmarked in a match against Auckland. He was also selected for the Auckland Provincial side and the Auckland side, where he played against England in the following matches. List's performance was notable for his try-scoring abilities and his contribution to his team's attacks. He was later named as part of a larger three-quarter group for the second test, with one player to be omitted. In the 1927 football season, List established himself as a top player and was likely to make a New Zealand team. He played on the wing in a match that the North Island won, scoring a try. His performance included a notable run that led to a try and preventing a try with a strong tackle. List also played in several matches for Kingsland, where he was recognized for his good form and skill. He was considered a top candidate for a center position in the Auckland team. In a match against South Auckland, List scored a try but Auckland lost the game. He was praised for his overall performance in the match, but criticized for holding onto the ball too long. List made his New Zealand debut in 1928 and continued to be a standout player. In 1933, List, a center for Marist, played 21 matches and scored 6 tries, along with 1 conversion. He also played 3 matches for Auckland and scored a try, which were his final representative matches. Despite his declining performance, List was selected for Auckland's matches against Taranaki and South Auckland, where he was criticized for his poor passing and ball handling.

The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides a detailed analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State. Earlier reports, such as "The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State (2007)" and "The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy," outline the expected effects of climate change on various sectors, including forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These impacts are primarily based on temperature and precipitation models, with a projected warming of 0.5 °F every ten years. Visible environmental consequences include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels.

Economic and ecological repercussions will result from these physical changes, particularly in hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Sectors such as agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and others will experience negative effects due to climate change. The economy of Washington State, which has a gross state product of approximately $268.5 billion, will be significantly influenced by these impacts.

Climate change can directly affect the availability and quality of resources that generate economic activity, as well as human health, leading to reduced quality of life. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of having their natural habitats disrupted due to glacier melting and altered water flow patterns. Projected outcomes. For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 °F (0.2 °C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 °F (1.1 °C) by 2020 and up to 3 °F (1.7 °C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington.. Three main conclusions were outlined: Climate change impacts are visible and the economic effects are becoming apparent.. The costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise.. Climate change will provide economic opportunities.: 7 . The economy of Washington State will dictate the effects of these impacts.   These effects are unique to Washington due to individual natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade.Climate change can directly affect the amount of resources that generate economic activity. Climate change can also affect the quality of important resources such as fresh drinking water, irrigation of crops and the generation of electricity. Climate change can also accelerate the depletion of capital assets used toward the formation of seawalls that are needed to protect shorelines from rising sea levels. Climate change can affect human health in ways that impact families and the workforce (e.g., premature death, increased sick days or leaves of absence, health care costs and insurance claims). All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington's gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State—Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.  This valley owes its special characteristics (wide-open expanse, wildflowers and views) to its heavy snows and short growing season—keeping it clear of trees. The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report highlights the significant impact of climate change on Washington State, influencing its economy and natural resources. Glacier melting, a result of global warming, is causing streams to diminish in national parks, such as North Cascades, Mount Rainier, and Olympic. This melting also threatens the unique meadows in Paradise Valley, potentially allowing trees to overtake the area and disrupting wildflowers. Forestlands, a significant part of Washington's economy, could experience changes in tree growth rates and pest populations due to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Climate change may reduce timber yields and introduce new pests, impacting the lumber industry. Electricity production, particularly hydropower, will be affected by altered peak snowpack melt, stream flows, and temperature changes, potentially increasing summer demands and decreasing early spring availability. The text discusses the impact of climate change on various industries in Washington state, particularly agriculture and fishing. In agriculture, the Yakima River Basin is expected to experience a decrease in irrigation water supply due to reduced snowpack, affecting crops such as dairy production, wine grapes, and wheat. The wine industry may shift from Eastern to Western Washington due to temperature changes, affecting land value, production, revenue, and employment. Wheat production in Eastern Washington is at risk due to inaccurate temperature predictions caused by topography. Vineyards, especially in Eastern Washington, may suffer greater losses due to increased instances of extreme weather. In the fishing industry, rising temperatures and potential ocean acidification pose a threat to Washington's fishing grounds, which could impact livelihoods and food sources for millions of people. Additionally, decreased snowfall and increased rain due to climate change may lead to decreased snowpack, affecting water storage and threatening salmon runs. Invasive species like Swollen Bladderwort may also spread due to warming temperatures, leading to habitat loss and increased fish mortality rates.

Following the declaration $25 million in economic aid, of which $13.6 million was allocated to the State of Washington, was provided via the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan. The funds supported habitat restoration, data collection and salmon license buyback programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided and additional $10 million in disaster unemployment assistance, with $6.4 million of those funds being allocated to Washington. The Rural Development Administration provided $3 million in grants to finance small business development and the Small Business Administration made low-interest loans and debt-restructuring available. All costs that could potentially continue to increase as global warming further degrade existing commercial salmon fisheries. Other potential costs may include an increase in the amount of government-sponsored buyback programs. These programs are designed to ease fishing pressure on declining stocks while providing financial assistance to those individuals who choose to exit the fishery. Buybacks take the form of Vessel Buyback Programs and License Retirement Programs. The average cost of a license or vessel purchased fewer than one of these plans is $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets but can rise as high as $10 million for a factory trawler such as those used further north in the Bering Sea. Nationally, these programs have totaled $160 million nationally since 1976. Lake Washington. According to the Washington Department of Fish And Wildlife, Lake Washington is believed to hold the largest urban sport salmon fishery in the United States. Research has shown that the temperature of Lake Washington's upper layers or epilimnion, have risen more than 2.5 °F (1.388 °C) in the past 40 years. Overall the water temperature has increased a full degree Fahrenheit. The effects on local salmon runs are increasing as well. As the water warms, the lake's resident population of zooplankton such as Daphnia, important food for juvenile salmon, are declining. Increased temperatures are delaying fall turnover and maintaining stratification nearly 4 weeks longer than in previous years. Earlier stratification means earlier algal blooms, necessary food for zooplankton such as Daphnia. Normally, the spring burst in the Daphnia population coincides with local algal blooms, providing them with the food they need to survive.  However, earlier blooms now mean that other zooplankton are eating the algae before the main Daphnia bloom, severely curtailing Daphnia numbers which have dropped by more than 50% over the last 26 years. In addition, salmon in stratified lakes are more likely to seek shelter in lower cooler layers of water leaving them more vulnerable to predation. It is estimated that rising temperatures played a major part in the disappearance of roughly half the sockeye salmon returning to the Cedar River watershed through the Ballard Locks and Lake 4Washington in 2004. Sport fishing. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Department reported that nationwide, 27.85 million US residents purchased fishing licenses in 2006 and the federal tax revenue generated by sport fishers was $8.9 billion, roughly the equivalent to that year's budget for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It has been noted that determining a definitive valuation of sport fishing is entirely subjective and based on supply and demand. Some factors that can be taken into account when determining value, other than tax revenue, are the market value of the fish that are caught, gross expenditures, i.e. travel, equipment, fishing license, expenses on site, etc., generation costs, defined as the cost of generating the demand, and market value of the fishing water, defined as the fisherman's willingness to pay for the ability to have access to the resource being valued. A 2003 report by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and a 2001 report by the American Sportfishing Association estimates that the economic impact in 2001 of restored salmon habitat on recreational fisheries in the state of Washington could potentially have yielded $1 billion in revenue and 9,400 jobs. Expanded to include Oregon and Idaho, revenue estimates for restored Northwest fisheries totaled $5.5 billion per year. The loss of these fisheries could then be assumed to potentially result in the loss of that revenue. In addition, as reported by the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, the numbers mentioned in these reports do not take into account the fact that recreational salmon and steelhead fishing is more costly than other sport fishing types and therefore accounts for more than their percentage of the total. In addition, these figures do not include economic totals from commercial or tribal fisheries. Local economics. Salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead and many other fish that are used economically will be negatively affected by the increase in temperatures. Southern species, including Hake and Mackerel are predators of baby salmon. Scientists say these species have been feeding on salmon migrating out of the Columbia River. The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report highlights the significant impact of climate change on Washington State, influencing its economy and natural resources. Glacier melting, a result of global warming, is causing streams to diminish in national parks, such as North Cascades, Mount Rainier, and Olympic. This melting also threatens the unique meadows in Paradise Valley, potentially allowing trees to overtake the area and disrupting wildflowers. Forestlands, a significant part of Washington's economy, could experience changes in tree growth rates and pest populations due to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Climate change may reduce timber yields and introduce new pests, impacting the lumber industry. Electricity production, particularly hydropower, will be affected by altered peak snowpack melt, stream flows, and temperature changes, potentially increasing summer demands and decreasing early spring availability. Washington State is part of the West Coast Governors’ Global Warming Initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases. These gases are categorized into energy, industrial processes, and agriculture, with varying impacts on global warming. Energy-related emissions are the largest source of greenhouse gases in Washington State, with transportation being the dominant sector. The state has implemented measures to encourage public participation in reducing emissions, such as the Climate Advisory Team (CAT) and the Citizen Engagement and Action Framework (CEAF). Seattle has enacted a green building policy and requires new public buildings to meet LEED standards. Green building has economic benefits and can result in significant savings over a building's lifetime. In Seattle, recycling is mandatory and there are penalties for disposing of recyclable materials in the garbage. This is intended to save residents and businesses money and reduce garbage costs. The text discusses the impact of climate change on various industries in Washington state, particularly agriculture and fishing. In agriculture, the Yakima River Basin is expected to experience a decrease in irrigation water supply due to reduced snowpack, affecting crops such as dairy production, wine grapes, and wheat. The wine industry may shift from Eastern to Western Washington due to temperature changes, affecting land value, production, revenue, and employment.

In the fishing industry, rising temperatures and potential ocean acidification pose a threat to Washington's fishing grounds, which could impact livelihoods and food sources for millions of people. Additionally, decreased snowfall and increased rain due to climate change may lead to decreased snowpack, affecting water storage and threatening salmon runs. Invasive species like Swollen Bladderwort may also spread due to warming temperatures, leading to habitat loss and increased fish mortality rates.

The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report highlights the significant impact of climate change on Washington State, influencing its economy and natural resources. Glacier melting, a result of global warming, is causing streams to diminish in national parks, such as North Cascades, Mount Rainier, and Olympic. This melting also threatens the unique meadows in Paradise Valley, potentially allowing trees to overtake the area and disrupting wildflowers. Forestlands, a significant part of Washington's economy, could experience changes in tree growth rates and pest populations due to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Climate change may reduce timber yields and introduce new pests, impacting the lumber industry. Electricity production, particularly hydropower, will be affected by altered peak snowpack melt, stream flows, and temperature changes, potentially increasing summer demands and decreasing early spring availability. The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides a detailed analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State. Earlier reports, such as "The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State (2007)" and "The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy," outline the expected effects of climate change on various sectors, including forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These impacts are primarily based on temperature and precipitation models, with a projected warming of 0.5 °F every ten years. Visible environmental consequences include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels.

Economic and ecological repercussions will result from these physical changes, particularly in hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Sectors such as agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and others will experience negative effects due to climate change. The economy of Washington State, which has a gross state product of approximately $268.5 billion, will be significantly influenced by these impacts.

Climate change can directly affect the availability and quality of resources that generate economic activity, as well as human health, leading to reduced quality of life. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of having their natural habitats disrupted due to glacier melting and altered water flow patterns. The text discusses the impact of climate change on respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, and coastal management in the Pacific Northwest. Regarding health, increased CO2 levels from human activities can exacerbate allergies and asthma due to stimulated pollen production and fungal growth. The text notes that Washington has a high prevalence of asthma, costing over $400 million yearly. In terms of heat-related illnesses, increased average yearly temperatures and more frequent heatwaves can lead to heat cramps, exhaustion, and stroke, with high costs for each mortality. Coastal management is also affected by climate change, with research suggesting that decreased forest cover and pollution can impact coastal waters. The text highlights the importance of federal consistency in coastal zone management and the development of a Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan. Lastly, the text mentions the impact of climate change on the ski industry in Washington's mountainous regions due to more rain and less snow. The text discusses the economic and health impacts of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on the fisheries industry and infectious diseases. Regarding the economy, the text mentions that the expansion of restored fisheries in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho could generate $5.5 billion annually, while their loss could lead to significant revenue loss. The text also highlights that sport fishermen, who spend more money per fish caught, are often left out in salmon allocation discussions, which can harm local economies when salmon populations are low. In terms of health, the text discusses the link between climate change and the West Nile fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and has already cost millions in other states. Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease, is also mentioned as a potential threat. Lastly, the text notes that global warming can exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma and allergies due to increased pollen production and fungal growth.

Seattle also plans to launch a campaign to encourage all City employees to reduce climate pollution not only on the job but also at home. Also, a new Department of Executive Administration green team will assess, and decide on whether to purchase climate friendly products, such as super-efficient "80-plus" computers and servers.Seattle's fifth plan is to inspire action. The Seattle Climate Partnership will provide employers with resources for assessing their climate pollution and implementing strategies for reducing emissions. The Department of Neighborhoods will launch a Neighborhood Climate Protection Matching Fund to help promote and finance neighborhood based projects that are geared towards reducing emissions and climate pollution.As of October 2007, the city of Seattle released that they have exceeded their goal reducing emissions to 8 percent of 1990 levels. There are 218 cities that have joined Mayor Nickels in a campaign to reduce emissions to at least 7% of 1990 levels. Even though the United States as a whole has not ratified the protocol, if all cities meet their goal, the joint reduction of emissions from the 219 cities, representing 44 million people, is equivalent to reductions from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries combined, says Denis Hayes, co-chairman of the mayor's Green Ribbon Commission on Climate Protection, which released the plan. Although Seattle is exceeding their goal of reducing GHG emissions, population growth fueled with their resistance to alternate methods of transportation is threatening their Kyoto goals.. For a cap and trade situation or even a tax to be truly effective they need to affect the individuals of the populations. Applying a tax to gas would greatly reduce the population's willingness to drive and make alternatives to drive more attractive. Also incentives to purchase hybrid cars, use biodiesel, and other climate friendly alternatives will greatly reduce fossil fuel dependence and use. Responses to climate change in Washington. Job growth. Forbes magazine ranked Washington State the fifth best state in the nation for business, and 3rd for environmental quality.  The emerging "green economy" (green collar jobs) designed to achieve efforts toward low carbon and sustainability is anchored by clean energy. WA is a national leader in addressing climate change and has taken steps to reduce its climate impact, and as a result opportunities for growth in the economy have been generated. Sustainable family wage jobs are developed through a focus on cleaner energy, smarter use of natural resources, and adoption of advanced technology. State Energy Policy Office studies documented 3,800 clean energy jobs in 1998 and 8,400 jobs in 2004. The Washington Climate Advisory Team (CAT) expects the state to meet Governor Gregoire's job creation goal of 25,000 clean energy jobs by 2020. And, Washington could potentially reach 31,000 family-wage jobs by 2025.. Clean Energy Sectors Include: Energy efficiency. Renewable energy (including solar, wind, fuel cell, geothermal, and biomass). Smart energy (using technological advances to improve all steps of the energy production to end-consumption process)Clean Energy Industry at a Glance: 241 organizations, 8,400 jobs. Average salary $60,000. More than $2.1 billion in 2004 revenues. 64% greater concentration of clean tech jobs in WA (highest per capita jobs and revenues were in Eastern WA) than the U.S. average Mitigation. The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) is working to develop regional strategies to mitigate climate change in 6 states of the western U.S., including Washington, and in the westernmost provinces of Canada. Its main thrust as of 2008, is to develop a region-wide multi-sector cap-and-trade program.In 2007, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire’s executive order passed putting into effect her climate change challenge goals.. Governor Gregoire aims to: Reduce Climate Pollution, and reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.. By 2050, reduce emissions by half of the 1990 levels.. Grow the Clean Energy Economy and create jobs that use cleaner energy. (Clean energy jobs grew 45% between 1998 and 2004).. Generate an increase in job growth to 25,000 by 2020.. Move toward Energy Independence (in 2006, $9 billion were spent on imported fuel—Gregoire hopes to recover that money to cycle it back into our economy by generating our own renewable fuel industry).. By 2020 reduce spending on imported fuel by 20 %.In 2005, Seattle reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% when compared to 1990 emissions. Despite Seattle’s economic/population growth since 1990, energy use has gone down. Programs, such as the Seattle Bicycle Master Plan (SBMP) will reduce emissions even further by increasing the number of bike lanes and improving pedestrian sidewalks. Seattle's Climate Action Plan includes a campaign to encourage city employees to reduce climate pollution in their personal lives and the creation of a green team to consider purchasing climate-friendly products. The city also plans to inspire action by providing employers with resources to assess and reduce their climate pollution, and launching a neighborhood-based project fund. Seattle has already exceeded its goal of reducing emissions to 8% below 1990 levels, contributing to Washington State's growth in the clean energy sector, which is expected to reach 25,000 jobs by 2020. The state is also part of the Western Climate Initiative, which is working to develop a regional cap-and-trade program. Seattle's programs, such as the Seattle Bicycle Master Plan, aim to further reduce emissions. Washington State is part of the West Coast Governors’ Global Warming Initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases. These gases are categorized into energy, industrial processes, and agriculture, with varying impacts on global warming. Energy-related emissions are the largest source of greenhouse gases in Washington State, with transportation being the dominant sector. The state has implemented measures to encourage public participation in reducing emissions, such as the Climate Advisory Team (CAT) and the Citizen Engagement and Action Framework (CEAF). Seattle has enacted a green building policy and requires new public buildings to meet LEED standards. Green building has economic benefits and can result in significant savings over a building's lifetime. In Seattle, recycling is mandatory and there are penalties for disposing of recyclable materials in the garbage. This is intended to save residents and businesses money and reduce garbage costs. The end affect should be a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 680,000 tons per year. Seattle's Climate Action Plan consists of: reducing Seattle's dependence on cars, increasing fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels, achieving more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle's homes and businesses, building on Seattle's leadership policy action, and to sustain Seattle's commitment policy action.. Seattle's first plan is to reduce Seattle's dependence on cars which is projected to cut emission by 170,000 tons. Their first plan of action is to significantly increase the supply of frequent, reliable and convenient public transportation. The single largest source of Seattle's GHG's come from the approximate two billion miles driven by gasoline fueled cars and trucks. The success of reducing this is to supply an alternative to driving. The city plans to invest $1.5 million to increase transit services and Transit Now plans to match the $1.5 million if the ballot passes in Seattle. Another alternative to driving is Sound Transit’s Link light rail system that will operate between downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The city will also implement a 10% commercial parking tax to set in over a three-year period beginning July 2007. Seattle also plans to rezone certain areas to provide neighborhoods easy access to transits, light rail systems, and provide amenities close enough to walk or bike. Mayor Nickels has allocated $100,000 to work with regional partners in an effort to explore and develop road pricing scenarios. Road pricing can take the form of tolling based on road congestion, the time of day, or even miles driven. These courses of action are to increase the incentives to substitute driving for a much more environmentally friendly commute.Seattle's second plan is to increase fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels; the projected cut in emissions is expected be 200,600 tons. Seattle will start by increasing the biodiesel blend from 20 percent biodiesel to as much as 40 percent in 2007. The use of biodiesel is growing and Seattle wants to promote the use of biodiesel by making it state law to require at least 2 percent by volume of diesel sales to be biodiesel. The port of Seattle uses B99 biodiesel (99% biodiesel 1% petroleum diesel) for its own use and also cuts emissions by turning off their diesel engines when in port by using electricity from Seattle City Light.  The electricity from Seattle City Light reduces GHG emissions from ferries by 30 percent.  The Seattle Police department will begin replacing all of its non-pursuit vehicles to efficient gas-electric hybrids in 2007.  Seattle will also provide incentives for taxicab owners to use gas-electric hybrids, and will also work in conjunction with taxi companies to decrease the amount of GHG emitted from their vehicles.Seattle's third plan is to achieve a more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle homes and businesses which is projected to cut GHG emissions by 316,000 tons. City Light has committed to acquire at least an average of 7.5 megawatts through conservation measures in 2007 and 2008, and they have already achieved its net-zero emissions status for 2007 by offsetting whatever emissions they produced by reducing emissions elsewhere. City Light spends about $2 per customer per year to meet its approximate carbon offset of 200,000 metric tons. City Light will continue to purchase 3 percent of its energy from Stateline Wind, a wind energy company. Seattle Steam Company, which provides heat and hot water to customers, will convert one of its fossil fuel boilers to an urban wood waste biofuel that will cut GHG emissions by 50,000 metric tons a year.. Seattle's fourth plan is to extend the city's leadership. Seattle's second largest department, Seattle Public Utilities, will evaluate its own greenhouse gas emission inventory and create a reduction target and action plan. Seattle plans on purchasing carbon-offset projects to compensate emissions from all business-related air travel by City employees. Seattle also plans to launch a campaign to encourage all City employees to reduce climate pollution not only on the job but also at home. Also, a new Department of Executive Administration green team will assess, and decide on whether to purchase climate friendly products, such as super-efficient "80-plus" computers and servers.Seattle's fifth plan is to inspire action. The Seattle Climate Partnership will provide employers with resources for assessing their climate pollution and implementing strategies for reducing emissions. The Department of Neighborhoods will launch a Neighborhood Climate Protection Matching Fund to help promote and finance neighborhood based projects that are geared towards reducing emissions and climate pollution.As of October 2007, the city of Seattle released that they have exceeded their goal reducing emissions to 8 percent of 1990 levels. There are 218 cities that have joined Mayor Nickels in a campaign to reduce emissions to at least 7% of 1990 levels.

The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides a detailed analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State. Earlier reports, such as "The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State (2007)" and "The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy," outline the expected effects of climate change on various sectors, including forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These impacts are primarily based on temperature and precipitation models, with a projected warming of 0.5 °F every ten years. Visible environmental consequences include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels.

Economic and ecological repercussions will result from these physical changes, particularly in hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Sectors such as agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and others will experience negative effects due to climate change. The economy of Washington State, which has a gross state product of approximately $268.5 billion, will be significantly influenced by these impacts.

Climate change can directly affect the availability and quality of resources that generate economic activity, as well as human health, leading to reduced quality of life. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of having their natural habitats disrupted due to glacier melting and altered water flow patterns. The text discusses Washington state's efforts to manage coastal non-point pollution and protect coastal areas through the Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan and the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. Climate change is expected to cause sea level rise (SLR) in Washington, with estimates projecting a rise of 8 inches per century in Seattle and up to 16 inches by 2040 in Tacoma. This SLR will impact coastal areas, including shipping terminals, marinas, and recreational facilities, and could cost billions of dollars to protect shorelines. The text also notes the impact of climate change on Washington's ski industry, with increased rain and decreased snowfall affecting winter recreation and the state's economy. Summer demands would probably increase due to more widespread need for air conditioning in order to keep homes and businesses cool, although estimates are still unknown.  Washington State's reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) means that changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows are important to the supply of electricity. Pg. 38. The available electricity supply could also be affected by climate change. Peak stream flows are in the summer.  Snowpack is likely to melt earlier in the future due to increased temperatures, thus shifting the peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer stream flow.  This would result in an increased availability of electricity in the early spring, when demand is dampened, and a decreased availability in the summer, when the demand may be highest. The economic impact from climate change in Washington could seriously alter the finances of the state. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predictions for the future of hydropower are grim. The state generates $777 million in gains from power sales. However, by 2020 they expect to see this fall to a deficit of $169 million and by 2040 a deficit of $730 million. These numbers understate the production shortfalls for the state because the number of air-conditioners were kept constant at current levels.  A recent assessment on climate change in Washington done by researchers from Oregon State University has published estimates that a revenue impact of 5% or less ($165 million).. Hydropower is more susceptible to climate change impacts than other sources of electricity, so consumers may be subject to greater rate increases than consumers in other states.. Washington residents have low costs for electricity due to only a few electricity companies being investor-driven. In 2006, Washington residents paid 6.82 cents per kWh, compared to the national average, which was 8.9 cents per kWh. Most of Washington's power companies charge only to break even. Thus, while prices may rise in Washington, they may still be comparable to other states in the US.Climate change will also affect how the state purchases electricity. During the summer months, Washington sells electricity to states such as California and Arizona because prices for their states is high in these seasons. During the winter months, Washington purchases electricity from these states because of the state's need for increased heating and lighting. Therefore, increased temperatures in the summer months will alter the selling of electricity to these states and cause the state to lose money. Municipal water supply. Seattle's municipal water systems may hit capacity in 2050.  In the October 2005, King County Climate Change Conference, a key topic of discussion was municipal water supply. Experts predict shorter winters and longer summers, which potentially can lead to winter flooding and more severe summer droughts. A 2005 University of Washington study states that the city of Seattle could see a 14% drop in water supply by 2040.  This decrease in the water supply would be equivalent to about 170,000 more people moving into the area. The Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) estimates that it will be able to maintain 171 million US gallons (650,000 m3) per day production for the next 50 years and meet demand which is estimated to maintain itself at 130 million US gallons (490,000 m3) as other cities such as Bellevue begin to use their own water supply. However, these numbers fail to take into account the effects of climate change. It is predicted that by 2040 the water levels will actually decrease to 147 million US gallons (560,000 m3) per day.With a predicted increase in temperature of 3° by 2040, the region's water supply as a whole is expected to decline.  Water supplies come from glaciers and mountain snowpack.  As temperatures rise, the elevation at which snow normally falls will increase, and there will be less water available during run-off seasons. Winter and early spring will produce more water than late spring flows, which will decrease the amount of available water during the summer. A lack of water will be problematic for both humans and the region's wildlife. This issue is also concerning because as water levels decrease, there is an expected increase in population in the Puget Sound region. The municipal water supply problem will affect different regions differently depending on the amount of public served by them and the amount of water supply that they can tap into. Everett for example, has a population of 100,000 and the Sultan river provides it with a vast amount of water compared to its population, so global warming will have a minimal effect on the supply of water to it. The Seattle region gets the bulk of its water from the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds. As the effects of global warming cause water levels to decrease in these watersheds, new water sources must be found.

"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life. They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals. A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning. Opposition to execution. Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran's execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran's case a "flagrant breach" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia's Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran's sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother's execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran's mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran's family. This allowed Nagaenthran's mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran's brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a "five-year-old child", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, "Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable."The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life. After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.

Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness. Background and early life. Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called "King", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance — for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. Nagaenthran and the people he interacted with were isolated to avoid spreading infection to more people and be given medical treatment in the meantime. There would also be measures taken to ensure regular testing of both prison staff and inmates for COVID-19. In addition to 54 supervising prison officers, a total of 169 prisoners from the prison, including those on death row, were confirmed to be infected as of 12 November 2021. Further death penalty debate and Singapore's response. The case has brought light to the issue of the death penalty in Malaysia. While many human rights groups pushed for abolition of the death penalty, most Malaysians believed that the death penalty should remain for serious crimes like murder and certain offences of corruption other than drug trafficking, and support for the death penalty remains high in Malaysia despite the decreasing numbers of new death sentences given by the courts. Legal professionals and enforcement, including some lawyers and police officers, commented that there should be some powers of discretion given to the judges to impose life imprisonment in some capital cases instead of death with respect to its mitigating circumstances, but they generally felt that the death penalty is overall still relevant to use against drug trafficking and murder and other offences, given the rampant rate of drug offences committed in Malaysia. Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul Aziz, who was debating the Budget 2022 in Dewan Rakyat, brought up the case of Nagaenthran and hopes that Malaysia can review its death penalty laws for drug traffickers in Malaysia, given that it also executed many drug offenders while appealing for mercy on its citizens in other countries, which was inconsistent with their stance towards drug convicts in and out of Malaysia.In light of the growing pressure by the United Nations (UN) to pardon Nagaenthran, Singapore's representative to the UN and Ambassador Umej Bhatia responded and highlighted that the courts in Singapore has already made it clear in their verdicts that Nagaenthran may have borderline intellectual functioning but he did not have mild intellectual disability, and they also gave their strictest due consideration to determine the eligibility of Nagaenthran's condition for execution, and even Nagaenthran's personal psychiatrist has also agreed that the Malaysian had no intellectual disability. With regards to the UN's accusations that Singapore had violated international law by imposing death sentences on drug offenders who committed "non-serious" crimes by international standards, Singapore stated there was no international consensus on the death penalty or what was the threshold of "serious crimes", and every country has the sovereign right to decide on its use of the death penalty and the types of capital offences they defined under the law.When facing the UN's other allegations that the fate of a drug offender were decided by the prosecution of Singapore and the unfairness towards Nagaenthran's family with a long list of strict rules of COVID-19 travel regulations, Singapore rebutted it by stating that the prosecution's decisions are independent of the government and they are still liable for review of their decisions, which Nagaenthran has already appealed for before the courts found no error after reviewing the prosecution's decisions. The COVID-19 travel restrictions and rules were not discriminatory towards Nagaenthran's family, as they were all similar to the ones which apply to all travellers entering Singapore from Malaysia during this period, and were made to address the present pandemic situation in Singapore, and the authorities made efforts to contact the family to allow them to understand the travel regulations and facilitate their stay in Singapore.On 12 November 2021, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also revealed that the ministers in Singapore, including Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, had responded to their respective Malaysian counterparts that Nagaenthran was being accorded full due process under the law and was not intellectually disabled as confirmed by the courts and psychiatric assessments, hence there should be no intervention in his case. In response to the government's statements, Malaysia's human rights lawyer N. Surendran and Lawyers for Liberty claimed that the Singapore government was fabricating their stand that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process, stating that the courts had not given Nagaenthran a full due court process by not taking into consideration of his intellectual and mental impairment or making accommodation to address them during the court proceedings. Human Rights Watch's senior disability rights expert Emina Ćerimović commented on Nagaenthran's case, "The inhumanity shown by the Singaporean authorities in Nagaenthran's case is truly shocking." Ćerimović also added, "The government's determination to execute a man with an intellectual disability for importing a small amount of drugs is disproportionate and cruel, and deserves global condemnation." Further appeals from Malaysia and other parties. Nagaenthran's lawyer, M Ravi, lacks medical expertise and his claim of Nagaenthran's mental age being below 18 is not supported medically. The prison officers who knew Nagaenthran did not observe any abnormal behavior from him. Nagaenthran was able to communicate and request for things, indicating mental competence. Nagaenthran tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the postponement of his execution. The prison staff and prisoners are being regularly tested for COVID-19. The case has sparked further debate on the death penalty in Malaysia, with most Malaysians supporting the death penalty for serious crimes.

Nagaenthran's mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, filed a lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, alleging that he had previously, as attorney general, prosecuted her son and denied him a fair trial. However, she had to represent herself in the lawsuit as no lawyers in Singapore were willing to take on the case due to potential repercussions. The lawsuit was dismissed the day before Nagaenthran's execution, with the court criticizing it as baseless and an abuse of the legal process. Following the rejection, Nagaenthran was granted two hours to spend with his family in the Supreme Court building before being taken back to Changi Prison for his execution. Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil for Nagaenthran the night before his execution, with two Malaysian lawyers being questioned by the police for participating. Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a "horrible blotch" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that "blatantly" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit.

However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be "devoid of merit". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that "no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: "There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word." Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a "calculated attempt" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to "stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice."After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: "I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of "harassing" and "intimidating" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations. A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning.

Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness. Opposition to execution. Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran's execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran's case a "flagrant breach" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia's Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran's sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother's execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran's mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran's family. This allowed Nagaenthran's mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran's brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a "five-year-old child", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, "Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable."The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life.

After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.

They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals. After Nagaenthran's final appeal was heard on 1 March 2022, the court reserved judgment. Four weeks later, the appeal was dismissed, and the court criticized Nagaenthran's lawyers for abusing the court process. The court rejected evidence from two foreign psychologists and accepted that Nagaenthran had borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. Nagaenthran's lawyers had previously objected to the admission of psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021. Following the dismissal of the appeal, civil groups urged Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show mercy, with some accusing the government of violating international law. A protest was held at Hong Lim Park against the use of the death penalty. Nagaenthran's family and lawyers were reportedly devastated by the dismissal of the appeal, and his execution was set to be imminent. Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases.

"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival.

Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations. Nagaenthran's 36-year-old sister Sharmila said that the family was saddened and shocked at their loss, and they were dissatisfied with Nagaenthran's final sentence despite coming to terms with his death. The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran's sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran's remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh. Over 200 family members and friends were present at the funeral. Reportedly, Sharmila did not allow a single politician to attend the funeral, claiming they're coming only for publicity but did not offer assistance while Nagaenthran was on death row.In the year 2022 itself, a total of eleven executions, including Nagaenthran's, were officially carried out in Singapore, all for drug trafficking. Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve's director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a "victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its "relentless machinery of death" since it left "no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a "disgraceful act" which was "ruthlessly carried out" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively "non-serious" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice. Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was "the working of a criminal mind" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong. Hence, Nagaenthran lost his final bid to be re-sentenced. Clemency petition and first public attention. Nagaenthran later appealed to the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob for clemency, which would have commuted his sentence to life imprisonment if successful, but his plea was rejected on 1 June 2020, which finalized his death sentence. The last time clemency was granted in Singapore was in 1998, when 19-year-old Mathavakannan Kalimuthu was pardoned from execution despite being sentenced to hang for murdering a gangster in 1996. Mathavakannan was paroled and released in 2012 after serving 16 years of his life sentence due to good behaviour.During the time Nagaenthran was appealing for clemency, his case attracted international attention and many who opposed the death penalty asked Singapore to spare Nagaenthran's life; Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam (aged 57 in 2019) and family also joined in the efforts to plead for mercy. In a 2019 news report, Malaysian human rights lawyer N Surendran denounced Singapore for unfairly subjecting a mentally disabled man to a death sentence, and he, together with Nagaenthran's new lawyer M Ravi argued that there was no fair trial for Nagaenthran since his defence's psychiatric evidence was allegedly not fully considered compared to the reports of the prosecution's psychiatrists.Singapore's law minister K Shanmugam, in light of prior accusations that Singapore was unfairly mistreating Malaysian drug traffickers (due to the increasing number of Malaysians being executed for drug trafficking), argued that there is no inequality in treating foreigners and locals under the law for drug trafficking. He said the majority of Singaporeans favour the death penalty and it would be good for both sides if drug traffickers were caught by Malaysian authorities, as the offenders could be dealt with according to Malaysia's laws and not have to worry about Singapore's capital punishment. Shanmugam emphasised that there should be no special treatment for Malaysian death row prisoners as it would undermine the integrity of Singapore's law. Death warrant and stay of execution. Confirmation of execution date. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore since January 2020, there was an informal moratorium on executions, including Nagaenthran's execution, possibly out of fear of spreading infections in Singapore's Changi Prison, where all death row inmates, including Nagaenthran, were held on death row. This allowed Nagaenthran to live for at least one more year after his failed clemency appeal.. On 28 October 2021, in Nagaenthran's hometown in Ipoh, Nagaenthran's family received a letter (dated 26 October 2021) from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), which informed them that Nagaenthran's execution date was scheduled on 10 November 2021. SPS also stated they will facilitate and help explain the travelling arrangements to any of Nagaenthran's family members on the necessary procedures on quarantine and COVID-19 tests, as well as allowing the family to have extended daily visits with a prolonged duration of a few hours and a maximum of five visitors per visit to curb possible risks of COVID-19 infection within the prison walls, due to Singapore's worsening rate of local transmission within the community (affected by the mutated Delta variant).At the time Nagaenthran's death warrant was finalized, the last execution to be conducted in Singapore was on 22 November 2019, when 36-year-old Abd Helmi Ab Halim was executed for trafficking over 16g of heroin in 2015 despite appeals from Malaysia to commute his sentence. Opposition to execution. Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures.

Following Nagaenthran's execution, legal proceedings were initiated against his former lawyer, Violet Netto, for practicing without a valid certificate during his case and the appeals of two other death row inmates. Another lawyer, M Ravi, who also represented Nagaenthran, faced multiple professional disciplinary inquiries, contempt proceedings, and police investigations. Both lawyers were ordered to pay costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers for unnecessary expenses incurred during the case. Separately, activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated for organizing public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit. In response to the abuse of court processes in capital cases, the government passed a new law imposing strict regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, allowing only the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of execution and hear the applications. This law was supported by most, but criticized by Human Rights Watch for potentially cutting off inmates' chances to oppose their execution. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a "horrible blotch" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that "blatantly" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that "blatantly" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be "devoid of merit". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that "no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: "There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word." Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a "calculated attempt" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to "stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice."After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: "I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of "harassing" and "intimidating" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations.

However, she had to represent herself in the lawsuit as no lawyers in Singapore were willing to take on the case due to potential repercussions. The lawsuit was dismissed the day before Nagaenthran's execution, with the court criticizing it as baseless and an abuse of the legal process. Following the rejection, Nagaenthran was granted two hours to spend with his family in the Supreme Court building before being taken back to Changi Prison for his execution. Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil for Nagaenthran the night before his execution, with two Malaysian lawyers being questioned by the police for participating. Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution. "The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival.

The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that "blatantly" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be "devoid of merit". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that "no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: "There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word." Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a "calculated attempt" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to "stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice."After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: "I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of "harassing" and "intimidating" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations.

After Nagaenthran's final appeal was heard on 1 March 2022, the court reserved judgment. Four weeks later, the appeal was dismissed, and the court criticized Nagaenthran's lawyers for abusing the court process. The court rejected evidence from two foreign psychologists and accepted that Nagaenthran had borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. Nagaenthran's lawyers had previously objected to the admission of psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021. Following the dismissal of the appeal, civil groups urged Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show mercy, with some accusing the government of violating international law. A protest was held at Hong Lim Park against the use of the death penalty. Nagaenthran's family and lawyers were reportedly devastated by the dismissal of the appeal, and his execution was set to be imminent. Legal proceedings against Nagaenthran's former counsel. On 10 May 2022, it was reported that Violet Netto, the lawyer who represented Nagaenthran in his second-last appeal to the Court of Appeal, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer and solicitor without a valid practising certificate on at least three occasions, including Nagaenthran's case and the last-ditch appeals of another two death row inmates Pausi Jefridin and Roslan Bakar. It was decreed under the law that solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year they act in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and Netto's certificate was expired at the time she represented Nagaenthran. For this, she potentially faced the maximum sentence of six months' jail, a S$2,500 fine, or both if convicted of acting as a lawyer without a valid certificate.Not only that, M Ravi, the human rights lawyer who also represented Nagaenthran before Netto, was subjected to seven separate professional disciplinary inquiries which may result in him being fined, suspended or struck off the Bar as a lawyer, in addition to three contempt proceedings as well as a number of police investigations for the repeated abuse of court processes through Nagaenthran's case. Ravi was also given a travel ban which restricted him from going to Malaysia. Due to these above proceedings against Nagaenthran's former lawyers, the rights groups and Malaysian lawyers criticised Singapore for supposed harassment of lawyers and stated that Singapore should respect the criminals' rights to legal representation, since Nagaenthran's mother and another prisoner Datchinamurthy Kataiah find themselves, in two separate cases, without the representation of legal counsel to argue their cases.On 25 May 2022, the Court of Appeal released a court order, in which they ruled that Ravi and Netto should pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) as compensation to the unnecessary costs incurred by the lawsuits both lawyers made without solid evidence in Nagaenthran's case; Ravi was to bear 75% of the total cost while the remaining 25% would be covered by Netto. A small-scale public funding event was carried out to gather funds to help Ravi and Netto to discharge their fine; some activists criticised Singapore for punishing the two lawyers for merely fulfilling their duties for their former client. Also, Ravi, who also need to pay S$10,000 and S$12,000 for another two lawsuits separately, remained defiant and unapologetic, stating that he paid a heavy price in saving lives from capital punishment despite the government's condemnation of his errors. Police probe of activists. On 27 June 2022, it was reported that several people including activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated by police for illegally organising three public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit to show their opposition to the death penalty and support for drug traffickers Abdul Kahar Othman and Nagaenthran before their executions on 30 March 2022 and 27 April 2022 respectively. Han and Howe were also asked by police to submit their anti-death penalty slogan shirts, handphones and other possessions as evidence for upcoming police investigations. Passing of the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill. In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate's execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal. The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022. While this law was supported by most like Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, there were criticisms from Human Rights Watch that Singapore did so to cut off inmates' chances to oppose their execution and access to last chances of justice. Following Nagaenthran's execution, legal proceedings were initiated against his former lawyer, Violet Netto, for practicing without a valid certificate during his case and the appeals of two other death row inmates. Another lawyer, M Ravi, who also represented Nagaenthran, faced multiple professional disciplinary inquiries, contempt proceedings, and police investigations. Both lawyers were ordered to pay costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers for unnecessary expenses incurred during the case. Separately, activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated for organizing public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit. In response to the abuse of court processes in capital cases, the government passed a new law imposing strict regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, allowing only the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of execution and hear the applications. This law was supported by most, but criticized by Human Rights Watch for potentially cutting off inmates' chances to oppose their execution. "The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life. They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred.

Nagaenthran's lawyer, M Ravi, lacks medical expertise and his claim of Nagaenthran's mental age being below 18 is not supported medically. The prison officers who knew Nagaenthran did not observe any abnormal behavior from him. Nagaenthran was able to communicate and request for things, indicating mental competence. Nagaenthran tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the postponement of his execution. The prison staff and prisoners are being regularly tested for COVID-19. The case has sparked further debate on the death penalty in Malaysia, with most Malaysians supporting the death penalty for serious crimes. Background and early life. Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called "King", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance — for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness.

The Metropolitan Cattle Market was relocated to a new site in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues at the Smithfield location. The new market, located on a former royal dockyard in Deptford, was built to accommodate increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. The market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once, with three large piers for disembarking animals. The site, which originally covered 22 acres and was later expanded to 30 acres, had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market was opened in 1872 and most livestock was slaughtered at the Deptford market by 1880. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall and included services such as bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and a pub. Trading was done through private bargain and the buyers were mainly wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. The market handled a significant portion of London's live cattle trade, with the largest number of cattle ever landed in one year being 224,831 (1897) and the largest number of sheep being 783,440 (1882). Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel—as in its repeal of the Corn Laws—had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era ("the first globalisation").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases—had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically naïve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy—a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to "schedule" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide. The main cattle market in London was historically located at Smithfield, but due to overcrowding and public health issues, it was moved to a new site in Islington called the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the mid-19th century. This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle. The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues. The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered animals for buyers within 10 days, and most of the meat was resold at Smithfield. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. In the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers bypassed the marketing system by taking advantage of a regulations loophole. The market slaughtered 16.5 million animals in total. Cattle boats from the Continent arrived at Deptford on Sundays and Wednesdays, and the market purchased three paddle steamers to convey more than 1.6 million animals. Animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon upon landing, and hides, horns, fleeces, and offal were disinfected. The market's employment conditions were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth, who found that the market had about 110 direct employees and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and had irregular hours and precarious employment.

However that may be, Plimsoll argued it was up to the customer to decide.  She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly — even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or £4 per head of cattle (≝ £5002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market's trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that "foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free — it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

The text is a collection of academic works and primary sources related to the meat and livestock industry, primarily focusing on the trans-Mississippi West and the North Atlantic meat trade from the late 1800s to early 1900s. The sources cover various topics, including the transportation and handling of livestock, regulations such as the 28-hour law, and the economic effects of diseases on the meat industry. Some specific examples include the origins of ranching in western Canada, the misrepresentation of meat in the British market, and the role of the postal service in the meat trade. The sources include annotated bibliographies, government bulletins, and magazine articles. The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues. The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered animals for buyers within 10 days, and most of the meat was resold at Smithfield. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. In the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers bypassed the marketing system by taking advantage of a regulations loophole. The market slaughtered 16.5 million animals in total. Cattle boats from the Continent arrived at Deptford on Sundays and Wednesdays, and the market purchased three paddle steamers to convey more than 1.6 million animals. Animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon upon landing, and hides, horns, fleeces, and offal were disinfected. The market's employment conditions were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth, who found that the market had about 110 direct employees and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and had irregular hours and precarious employment. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law; the buyers took away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces: most of the meat they resold at Smithfield.  By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).  Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations — that animals need not be put up for sale on market days — to bypass the marketing system altogether.  See The Beef Trust, below.. Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford. Cattle boats. Cattle boats from the Continent — over a thousand a year — came up the Thames on Sundays and Wednesdays.As the transatlantic cattle trade developed (see below), large ocean-going cattle steamers came into use, but these were reluctant to come alongside.  Accordingly the market purchased three paddle steamers (named Racoon, Taurus and Claude Hamilton) into which cattle were transshipped at Gravesend.  Between them, those vessels conveyed more than 1.6 million animals to Deptford. Jack the Ripper, Deptford cattle boat man. One of the many theories about Jack the Ripper was that he was a Portuguese cattle attendant on a boat from Porto.  When it docked at Deptford, a Whitechapel murder ensued, or so insisted a customs official who claimed to see a statistical correlation.  His persistence irritated the police, but his theory was noticed by Queen Victoria.  "The Queen fears the Detective Department is not as efficient as it might be...  Have the cattle boats & passenger boats been examined?" Veterinary. On landing, animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon who took their pulse and temperature.  Suspects were set aside for observation.  If one animal in a cargo was found to be contagious, it was slaughtered at once and its carcase sterilised by steam in an iron digester; its companions were put with the suspects.  Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.  The Essex man, needing a good steed, had been induced by a glowing advertisement to pay £30 for a horse, viewable at Deptford Market.  He did not realise it was in no condition to be ridden away. George Philcox. To find a superintendent for the market the City interviewed 25 candidates, and chose a 28-year old Southend station-master, George Philcox.  Philcox was in charge of the market for the next 40 years; when he died in 1912, it soon closed.  Apparently an able and popular man, it was said "The market made him, and in turn he made it". Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.

Specific examples include the transportation of cattle from the western US to the eastern US, the impact of the British market on European agriculture, and the role of meat production in Argentina on the US industry. The sources include government bulletins, magazine articles, and academic papers. The text also mentions the impact of contagious diseases on livestock, such as pleuro-pneumonia, and the regulations surrounding the meat trade, such as the 28-hour law. The text also touches on the humanitarian reforms and the resistance to new slaughter technology in 19th century Britain. The text provides additional sources related to the meat and livestock industry, with a focus on transportation, regulations, and economic effects of diseases. It includes works discussing the impact of transportation on cattle health, such as the use of "palace cars" for the cattle trade and the development of Atlantic cattle-carrying. The sources also touch on the role of regulations in the meat industry, such as the exclusion of live animals coming from Germany and the importation of foreign cattle. The texts include firsthand accounts, such as accounts of the Deptford cattle market and the experiences of women in the market. The time period covered in these sources ranges from the 19th century to the early 20th century. The sources include government bulletins, magazine articles, and firsthand accounts.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Plimsoll advocated for the abolition of the live cattle trade due to poor animal welfare conditions and lack of commercial purpose. However, his campaign led to improved regulations instead. Critics like Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. Despite potential fraud and consumer prejudice, American chilled beef was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Plimsoll argued that customers should have the right to choose between chilled and British-grown beef. Perren acknowledged that fraud existed in the chilled meat trade, with some butchers selling Deptford-killed meat as English for a higher price. However, effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933. The transatlantic cattle trade led to cheaper bread due to the need for ballast in vessels carrying cattle, which was often filled with American grain. Ultimately, the live cattle trade declined due to an embargo on Argentine cattle and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, leading to the closure of the Foreign Cattle Market in 1913.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London underwent significant changes, including the appointment of a new superintendent, George Philcox, who led the market for 40 years until his death in 1912. The market employed about 110 direct workers and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who faced irregular hours and precarious employment due to the market's dependence on ship arrivals and changing animal disease regulations. Drovers, who were mostly former "ochre boys," were paid per vessel and could earn high wages, while slaughtermen earned high wages but faced brutalizing working conditions and long hours. Women, known as "gut girls," were employed to clean cattle and sheep intestines, a job that was originally done by men but was assigned to women after a strike for higher pay. The working conditions for these women were described as unpleasant and odorous. The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues. The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep.

George Philcox. To find a superintendent for the market the City interviewed 25 candidates, and chose a 28-year old Southend station-master, George Philcox.  Philcox was in charge of the market for the next 40 years; when he died in 1912, it soon closed.  Apparently an able and popular man, it was said "The market made him, and in turn he made it". Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth's researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. There is a record of market workers sending a wreath to the funeral of George Joseph Cooper MP, admired because at one time Argentina was put on the blacklist and he had tried very hard to get it removed.  In 1924, years after the market had closed, efforts were still being made to get it re-opened. Drovers. It was their job to drive the animals off the boats, or to transship them from the transatlantic steamers at Gravesend.   Nearly all the drovers begin their life in the market as "ochre boys", that is, boys who mark the animals with ochre for the butchers, and who are paid a few pence for so doing.  When they get old enough, and begin to pick up the drover's craft, they apply to the City Corporation for a licence, which is granted on satisfactory proof of good character on the payment of a fee of 5s, and is annually renewable without further payment.. Drovers at Deptford market were paid a lump sum per vessel, George Philcox told Booth.  They could unload a cattle boat in as little as 15 minutes. Some cattle, especially from Argentina, were very wild, and were best given "a wide berth". A man in regular employment could earn as much as £4 a week (about £520 purchasing power in 2018 money). Slaughtermen. These men, who killed and butchered the animals, worked in gangs of four, and earned very high wages for the era: £5 (≅ £6502018) a week was not uncommon. No slaughtering was done on Saturdays; on other days it varied according to demand, and for a rush order might last up to 20 hours on end.  The work was said to be brutalising "and conducive to drink".A carefully aimed blow at the head with a poleaxe was the usual method of stunning used in Britain.  While The Times reported favourably on the relative humanity practised at Deptford, it came from the skill acquired by regular repetition; it was not infallible.  A tanner, examining the lesions on a sample 100 cattle hides — albeit not from Deptford — noted that 45% showed signs of more than one blow i.e., they were not stunned by the first stroke.  An advocate of the Jewish shechita method (which was also used at the market) said that he had observed that it often took five blows to fell an ox at Deptford.That women slaughtered animals at Deptford is not supported by reliable sources. Women: the gut girls. One of the most unpleasant jobs was cleaning cattle and sheep intestines, which were used for making sausage skins (and, according to a later source, condoms).  Originally men's work, in about 1891 they went on strike for more pay: management responded by assigning the work to women.. Some 80-100 women and girls, aged 14 to 40, were employed daily; they worked for two firms that had contracted to buy all the gut offal from the market's slaughterhouses.  Writing for the Daily Telegraph, "A Lady Visitor", who claimed to have smelled some vile odours in her time, said the stink was insupportable.  Tubs of unwashed entrails were coarsely de-fatted by men. The women's share in the ugly business begins when the greasy, slimy intestinal skins [many yards long] come to them for the scraping off of all fat and substance still attaching to them. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London underwent significant changes and employed about 110 direct workers and 1,500 casual workers, including "gut girls" who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. This unpleasant and odorous job was originally done by men but was assigned to women after a strike for higher pay. The women worked for two firms that had contracted to buy all the gut offal from the market's slaughterhouses and made good wages. However, when Queen Victoria took an interest in the working conditions of the girls and the Duchess of Albany discovered that the gut firms had been processing entrails from outside the market, the City's markets committee banned it as a health risk, leaving the women unemployed. A charity, the Deptford Fund, had to be started to support them. The market was a significant part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw a shift from European to American livestock suppliers due to disease concerns. The American West, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, became the primary source of cattle, accounting for 95% of exports by 1884. Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for £10 or £12. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits. Canadian Pacific Railway facilitated cattle exports from Alberta and Assiniboia, while the Argentine beef industry transformed into a major exporter due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. From 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London. The main cattle market in London was historically located at Smithfield, but due to overcrowding and public health issues, it was moved to a new site in Islington called the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the mid-19th century. This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle. Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel—as in its repeal of the Corn Laws—had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era ("the first globalisation").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases—had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically naïve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy—a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to "schedule" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced significant changes in its livestock suppliers. As the North American surplus decreased, Argentina became the primary source of animals, surpassing Europe. This shift was due to the Argentine beef industry's transformation, which involved selective breeding and the introduction of alfalfa forage, resulting in high-quality cattle. From around 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.

However, the live meat trade faced challenges. The journey was long and difficult, causing significant losses during transportation. In 1895, the Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, resulted in only 32 animals arriving alive, leading to the vessel being prohibited from carrying live stock for a year. Additionally, the Beef Trust, a cartel of large Chicago meat packers, controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America by the early 20th century. They were accused of buying up shops in Smithfield Market, fixing British beef prices, and controlling lairages at Deptford Market, which negatively impacted the market.

Animal welfare during these journeys was also a concern. "Wild, untamed brutes" struggled with the sea voyage and had to be tamed and taught to eat hay in advance. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of good chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford.

The Australasian live trade also suffered from "terrible" losses, with 607 cattle and 57 sheep lost out of the total shipped. Despite these challenges, the Beef Trust maintained its control over the North Atlantic meat trade, but its influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw a shift from European to American livestock suppliers due to disease concerns. The American West, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, became the primary source of cattle, accounting for 95% of exports by 1884. Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for £10 or £12. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits. Canadian Pacific Railway facilitated cattle exports from Alberta and Assiniboia, while the Argentine beef industry transformed into a major exporter due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. From 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London. Forrest Capie and Richard Perren said that, although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were [just] the terminal stations of a great network of main German railway lines and branch lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia and extended right up to Bessarabian frontier. In the 1860s the Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before they reached their port of embarkation. . Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.  The Russian capital was more than 30° to the east of Deptford, and these animals may have come from much further still, since Saint Petersburg oblast raised few export-grade cattle.  They may have been driven to market from south Russia.  In 1872 the Russian Empire was blacklisted for cattle plague and no more Russian cattle could be landed, even at Deptford. Demise of European cattle trade. The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s — except for Iceland — after the British authorities faced the fact that too much livestock was really coming from places where disease was endemic "and the provincial authorities made no attempt to stamp it out". For example Prussia had stringent laws against animal disease but "the profits from smuggling cattle from Poland are too enticing.By then the United States had become the main supplier. From the United States. Of all the cattle ever landed at Deptford market, the largest proportion came from the U.S.A.  The practice started in 1878 when American cattle and pigs were "scheduled" for port slaughter. By 1913, when Deptford had closed, 3,144,400 American cattle had been landed there, besides sheep and pigs.Nearly all American livestock exports went to England. Americans sent livestock to England because they had a surplus that could not be absorbed by local demand.  When, eventually, it was, which happened by 1913, exportation ceased.  Writing in 1915, two senior American officials said: "Our beef surplus has vanished and our own people now require all that our farms and ranches produce". Upgrading livestock in the American West. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West.  But early Western cattle e.g. Texas longhorns, though hardy, made tough eating.  It cost exactly the same to ship a top quality steer from New York to London as a gristly one.  Consequently, it made economic sense for American shippers to export their best animals, as better able to absorb the cost of carriage. At first, export-grade cattle were to be found in the East only, where cattle breeds were similar to those of the British Isles.  British farmers were advised not to worry about imported Western livestock for the present, because it would not compete on quality.  But (as predicted) Western cattlemen realised they could capture lucrative markets by improving their stock — and did so.  The English export trade contributed to the demand for more and better cattle.Stockmen found profitable the exportation of only the choicest grade cattle and attained this quality by upgrading the range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood...  The trade therefore became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.   Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.  "On the western plains the ranches that succeeded the open range bought high priced sires with which to upgrade their old stock. The upturn in the quality of beef animals, with younger cattle going to the feedlot, meant better beef from the slaughter house and on the family table, all part of a general improvement". It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.  By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. Distances. Already in 1880 The Times was advising its readers that a 1,200 pounds (540 kg) steer from (say) Colorado, Wyoming or Montana could be conveyed to Deptford market — over 2,000 miles of land and 3,000 of ocean — for £10 or £12. It included cowboys' wages, rail fare, shipping freight and the landing charges at Deptford (which, thought the author, were rather extortionate).  All this added only 4d a pound to the carcase price of beef (≅£4.40 a kilo2018).Scientific American reported that, recently, five cattle-laden steamers had sailed from New York to England in one day. In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw significant changes with the addition of women workers, known as "gut girls," who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. However, after Queen Victoria took an interest in their working conditions and the discovery of outside entrails being processed, the market banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

The cattle in this new trade "come principally from Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado".. Some cattle came to Deptford from as far away as Oregon, though this was sporadic.  The English adventurer Moreton Frewen, writing to The Times, saidCroma, due at Deptford Saturday, the 25th, has on board a hundred fat bullocks, the first consignment of western American cattle that have as yet taken advantage of the cheap transportation afforded by the Great Lakes. The majority of them were bred by myself and brother in Wyoming in 1881, but some few which can be distinguished by their brand ... are from far distant Oregon, and, having walked through from there to Wyoming in 1882, were purchased by me at the end of their long march.  It is [remarkable] that beasts calved more than 6,000 miles away on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, matured in Wyoming and fattened on Lake Superior, should have been destined after crossing the Atlantic on the hoof, to "terminate their engagements" in the Thames. Significance to the West. The exportation of cattle to England had a discernible impact on the American livestock industry.  While not all American exports went to Deptford, London was the most important market.  Wrote John P. Huttman:The impact of foreign demand for U.S. meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds". As noted, the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.. Further, some British agriculturalists, shielded until recently from American competition — first by distance, then by quality issues — found it attractive to go in for American ranching themselves. They "fought competition at its source and engaged directly in American ranching, until by 1884 it was estimated that 'one-sixth of all our herds are now owned by Englishmen'".  And British investors, attracted by the fabulous profits sometimes realised in the West, made an important contribution to its development. From Canada. A major export industry at the time, range cattle came from Alberta and Assiniboia and went east on the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The St. Lawrence River route meant that cattle started the voyage in calm waters and comparatively cool weather. "Most of the losses of cattle in shipments from Atlantic ports were due to delay and neglect prior to shipping and occurred during the first few days of the crossing".  For many years Canadian livestock was considered disease-free and could be landed freely, but it was scheduled for slaughter at Deptford from 1892 on.  It did western ranchers little harm:The movement of high quality to the British market continued unabated. These great range-bred cattle had to be slaughtered within the port holding pens anyway, because they were too wild to ship conveniently to provincial butchers.Exports to England rose from 115,000 cattle in 1900 to 160,000 in 1905, but petered out after a severe winter depleted half the range-cattle industry's working capital. From Argentina. As the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford's main supply of animals came from Argentina.  Formerly, Argentine cattle "were of an inferior breed, their chief characteristics being thick hides and well-developed horns"; they were slaughtered locally for their hides, bones and tallow. Two things transformed the Argentine beef industry into the greatest exporter in the world: selective breeding and alfalfa (lucerne) forage.From about 1888 live cattle and sheep were shipped as deck cargo from Buenos Aires, carpenters knocking up temporary stalls and pens.  Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.

This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle. Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel—as in its repeal of the Corn Laws—had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era ("the first globalisation").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases—had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically naïve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy—a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to "schedule" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Plimsoll campaigned against the transatlantic cattle trade due to its dangers and cruelty to animals. He pointed out the instability of cattle ships in stormy weather, the suffering of animals due to poor transportation conditions, and the use of cruel methods to make animals stand up. Plimsoll called for the abolition of the trade. Although his campaign was unsuccessful, it led to some improvements in British and American regulations. The cattle trade was dominated by the Beef Trust, which established a liner system for regular and coordinated shipments. However, even in these improved conditions, animals still faced difficulties such as accumulation of dung and urine, freezing seawater, and lengthy journeys. Plimsoll's allegations were largely confirmed by a government inquiry. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Plimsoll advocated for the abolition of the live cattle trade due to poor animal welfare conditions and lack of commercial purpose. However, his campaign led to improved regulations instead. Critics like Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. Despite potential fraud and consumer prejudice, American chilled beef was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Plimsoll argued that customers should have the right to choose between chilled and British-grown beef. Perren acknowledged that fraud existed in the chilled meat trade, with some butchers selling Deptford-killed meat as English for a higher price. However, effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933. The transatlantic cattle trade led to cheaper bread due to the need for ballast in vessels carrying cattle, which was often filled with American grain. Ultimately, the live cattle trade declined due to an embargo on Argentine cattle and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, leading to the closure of the Foreign Cattle Market in 1913. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cattle trade, dominated by the Beef Trust, involved transporting animals from the US and Canada to Britain. The journey included travel by train, often for over 28 hours without proper rest, food, or water, and by ship, where animals faced harsh conditions such as freezing seawater and overcrowding. Plimsoll criticized the trade for its dangers and cruelty, and while his campaign for abolition was unsuccessful, it led to improvements in British and American regulations. A government inquiry confirmed Plimsoll's allegations of poor treatment of animals. The trade's primary purpose, according to Plimsoll, was to enrich dishonest traders, rather than serving a rational commercial purpose. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the live cattle trade, dominated by traders prioritizing profit over animal welfare, faced criticism from Samuel Plimsoll. The trade, which shipped animals from the US, Canada to Britain, involved harsh conditions and lengthy journeys resulting in injured and deceased animals. Plimsoll advocated for abolition, but his campaign led to improved regulations instead. In Canada, the trade was described as wasteful and unprofitable, with animals arriving in poor condition. Plimsoll argued that the trade had no rational commercial purpose, as imported beef could be cheaper, easier, and in better condition. An alternative was American chilled meat, which was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Despite being cheaper, American chilled beef sold at a premium due to potential fraud and consumer prejudice. Plimsoll maintained that chilled meat was as good as, if not better than, Deptford-killed beef. Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. However, once cold-storage was available, chilled meat could be kept for an additional 14 days, and livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival. The chilled trade was also larger, making the live animal trade less appealing.

. A government official wrote: "Under the present system not a train is brought to any great market without having many crippled beeves, and several dead ones". In Canada. There was no 28-hour law in Canada and rail journeys were immense. The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was "sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain "gaunt and shrunken". Whether economic justification for live cattle trade. Plimsoll's case. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders.  He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not — namely "best Scotch", "town-killed", or "English-fed" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut ("dressed") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently — as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it. A writer to The Times said:I know a family in this town of good position who after much anxious thought and weighing all the chances of being poisoned, &c, timorously resolved one day to try this American beef. Unfortunately, the servants heard of the great experiment. The joint, a fine one, was duly served; the family ate and liked it... But, would you believe it, Sir, not one of the four servants would touch it!  By the Edwardian era two authors said "the West-End folk are very large customers for chilled beef of the highest quality", which suggests it could be quite palatable.  However that may be, Plimsoll argued it was up to the customer to decide.  She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly — even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.

He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or £4 per head of cattle (≝ £5002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market's trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that "foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free — it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Plimsoll advocated for the abolition of the live cattle trade due to poor animal welfare conditions and lack of commercial purpose. However, his campaign led to improved regulations instead. Critics like Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. Despite potential fraud and consumer prejudice, American chilled beef was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Plimsoll argued that customers should have the right to choose between chilled and British-grown beef. Perren acknowledged that fraud existed in the chilled meat trade, with some butchers selling Deptford-killed meat as English for a higher price. However, effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933. The transatlantic cattle trade led to cheaper bread due to the need for ballast in vessels carrying cattle, which was often filled with American grain. Ultimately, the live cattle trade declined due to an embargo on Argentine cattle and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, leading to the closure of the Foreign Cattle Market in 1913.

Youngkin's environmental and energy actions include withdrawing from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, proposing a nuclear reactor, and altering the permit-issuing process, which was criticized by environmental groups. He vetoed healthcare bills, contradicting national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation. In education, he reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges, facing criticism for pitting student groups against each other. Regarding LGBTQ+ rights, Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports it legally, and he hosted a private Pride event without inviting LGBTQ+ legislators, which was boycotted. He also declined to issue a Pride Month proclamation. In response to the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade, Youngkin refused to discuss hypotheticals regarding Obergefell v. Hodges. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, which would make Virginia the only US state with misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount. After the replacement policies regarding transgender students' rights in schools were announced by the Youngkin administration, most Virginia school districts had not adopted them, with some refusing due to belief of violation of state law. Critics argue that the policies may not meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill, and may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act and a 2020 court ruling. Shortly after the policies were announced, thousands of students protested by walking out of school.

In terms of education budget, both Youngkin and McAuliffe campaigned on increasing the budget, but Youngkin's platform was criticized for lacking details and focusing more on cultural issues. After taking office, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a record-breaking biennial state budget that allocated $19.2 billion to education, exceeding the amount that Republicans had initially wanted. The budget included a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years, one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers, and $1.25 billion for school construction and maintenance. The Virginia Preschool Initiative was also expanded. He has also backed the idea of repealing both collective bargaining rights for public employees and the requirement that all public works use project labor agreements. Education. Youngkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies. According to Politico, Youngkin "hung his campaign on education". The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into "a cultural war zone". Cultural issues and curriculum. Throughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state. Politifact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms. The publication wrote, "Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students." Critics of Youngkin noted that he sent his own children to private schools where resources promoting critical race theory have been recommended. Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as "ground zero for Youngkin's victory", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as "a transphobic dog whistle".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order "targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students."This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as "a dumbing down of standards". Youngkin called the program a "left-wing takeover of public education", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes – a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign. James Lane, Virginia Superintendent at the time, and NPR, both disputed this characterization of the program. The Virginia Math Pathways Initiative would have prioritized data science and data analytics over calculus while still offering students the opportunity to enroll in calculus at an accelerated pace. Although education officials within the Northam administration explored the potential benefits of detracking students prior to the 11th grade, no plans to do so were ever adopted, and in April 2021, those officials explained that the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative was not designed to eliminate advanced math classes at any grade level. Youngkin's administration has taken a firm stance against hypotheticals, as seen in his response regarding the potential reversal of the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, making Virginia the only state with misdemeanor penalties for exceeding the legal amount. This proposal was influenced by a 2021 recommendation from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. In voting rights, Youngkin has continued restoring rights to former felons, but an automatic restoration amendment failed due to Republican opposition. Youngkin also campaigned for various candidates in the 2022 federal midterms, including those who embraced false claims about the 2020 election, which drew criticism from moderate Republicans. Regarding former Maine governor Paul LePage, who is known for racist comments, Youngkin initially claimed ignorance of the situation.

After becoming governor, Youngkin established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools, which received national attention and criticism for being viewed as divisive, authoritarian, and unfairly targeting educators. The tipline was part of a broader push to address critical race theory in the state's curriculum. However, it was argued that a bill signed by Youngkin had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law. The administration received criticism for not responding to inquiries about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used and denying FOIA requests. In November 2022, it was reported that the administration had closed down the tipline as tips had dried up. Additionally, Youngkin attempted to amend a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board, aiming to hold the board accountable for their handling of sexual assault cases in the school system. However, the amendment was not successful. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin "has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law." Tipline for "divisive practices". During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as "divisive practices" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report "any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools." Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would "catalogue it all" and begin "rooting it out".The tipline was described by The Washington Post as "part of a broader push by Youngkin to identify and root out what he says are elements of critical race theory in the state’s curriculum." The publication further reported that the tipline was viewed by "a teachers union, Democrats in the General Assembly, some parents and other observers...as divisive, authoritarian and unfairly targeting educators." Virginia Republicans have defended the tipline by comparing it to systems that previous governors of the state had set up for people to report violations of business regulations and health protocols. On January 26, a spokesperson for Youngkin tweeted that critics of the tipline had mischaracterized it and described the tipline as "a customary constituent service."A week after the tipline debuted, CNN reported that the initiative had drawn national attention. Colin Jost derided the tipline on Saturday Night Live during Weekend Update, and John Legend encouraged opponents of the initiative to co-opt the tipline, tweeting, "Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced. We are parents too." Several media outlets reported that critics of Youngkin were spamming the tipline. Describing it as a "snitch line", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would "backfire" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by "Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.On February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was "responding" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the "working papers and correspondence" exemption in Virginia's FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the "working papers and correspondence" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin's office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had "quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up". The second lawsuit is still ongoing. Loudoun County School Board proposal. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members. A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at "holding [the board] to account" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier. Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign. After being elected, Youngkin established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools, which was criticized for being divisive, authoritarian, and unfairly targeting educators. It was part of a broader push to address critical race theory in the state's curriculum, but a signed bill had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law. The administration received criticism for not responding to inquiries about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used and denying FOIA requests. The tipline was closed down in September 2022 due to a lack of tips.

Youngkin attempted to amend a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board, aiming to hold the board accountable for their handling of sexual assault cases in the school system. However, the amendment was not successful. The amendment was criticized as an attempt to subvert the election results and an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.

In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools, established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. The new policies require student-access to school facilities and programs to be determined by biological sex, and mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender. The policies also mandate that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun. These actions are expected to face court challenges as several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had "quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up". The second lawsuit is still ongoing. Loudoun County School Board proposal.

A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at "holding [the board] to account" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier. Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign. In response to Youngkin's proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office. The Washington Post reported that Youngkin's effort had "stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia." The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the "more controversial actions" that Youngkin had taken and led to "one of the harshest partisan eruptions" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin's term. Legal scholar A.E. Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia's Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s. The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Repeal of protections for transgender students. In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools. These protections had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. That bill requires that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with "model policies" developed by the Virginia Department of Education. Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes. The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student. Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin's policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students. It has been suggested that Youngkin's policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot "encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student’s parent, including information related to gender."The Youngkin administration framed its replacement of the Northam administration's policies as part of a "commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students." The Washington Post noted that Youngkin's actions fit into a national trend among Republicans, writing that "at least 300 pieces of legislation" curtailing the rights of transgender Americans had been introduced throughout the country in 2022, mostly focusing on children. Despite the legal requirement that they do so, most Virginia school districts had failed to adopt the Northam administration's model policies by the time that the Youngkin administration's replacement policies were announced. Other school districts have refused to adopt the Youngkin administration's model policies, expressing the view that these policies are in violation of state law.Youngkin's actions are expected to face court challenges. Although the 2020 bill signed by Northam did not specify what Virginia's model policies for the treatment of transgender students should be, it stated that the policies should "address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices" and that the policies should protect transgender students from bullying and harassment. Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet this criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law.

Youngkin's 2022 budget includes $1,000 bonuses for teachers, $1.25 billion for school construction, and an expansion of the Virginia Preschool Initiative to include younger children and higher-income families. To address teacher shortages, Youngkin issued an executive order to make it easier for certain individuals to become teachers. Youngkin supports expanding charter schools and has proposed $100 million for re-establishing lab schools, which he wants to open to partnerships with community colleges and private universities. He also advocates for revising school funding to allocate per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools instead of to the public school boards for the districts where the students reside. However, not all of his proposals have been adopted. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers. This plan was chosen over the one preferred by Republicans, which would have paired a more modest 8% salary increase for teachers over two years with 1% bonuses.School construction and maintenance received $1.25 billion in the 2022 biennial state budget. This exceeds the amount that had been allotted for these needs in Northam's outgoing budget proposals but is a small fraction of the $25 billion that the Virginia Department of Education says it would take to fully replace the state's oldest schools.The Virginia Preschool Initiative was expanded by the 2022 biennial state budget. This program provides preschool for many low-income children in the state. Prior to 2022, the program only served children aged four or older, and only families earning less than the federal poverty line could qualify. The 2022 state budget that Youngkin signed lowered the age eligibility to include three year olds and raised the income threshold to 300% of the federal poverty line. Teacher shortages. In September 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order directing education officials in his administration to combat Virginia's teacher shortages by easing the process of gaining a teaching license in the state. The order aims to fill vacancies by focusing in large part on recruiting retired teachers, people whose teaching licenses have expired, people with out-of-state teaching licenses, college students in teacher training programs, and military veterans seeking to transition into teaching careers. The order also provides additional funding to school districts with the most severe teacher shortages in Virginia and seeks to bolster in-school child care options for teachers.The Washington Post reported that "Youngkin’s actions to loosen standards regarding who can become a teacher mirror efforts in other states, including Florida and Arizona, as the nation faces a catastrophic teacher shortage." According to the same publication, some educator groups in Virginia have criticized aspects of Youngkin's executive order, arguing that it could "allow unqualified individuals to teach children", while education policy experts have argued that teacher shortages have been exacerbated in Virginia by education-related culture war issues that Youngkin has escalated during his governorship. Charter schools and lab schools. While running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term. After the election, The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that Youngkin's actual goal for charter schools would be to increase the number in Virginia "to match North Carolina, which has more than 200." Only seven charter schools currently exist in Virginia, one of the lowest amounts in the country, and Youngkin has backed proposed legislation that would shift the authority to approve new charter schools from local school boards to newly created "regional charter school divisions". These divisions would have nine voting members, eight appointed by the Virginia State Board of Education, and one appointed by local school boards within the region.The state budget that Youngkin signed for 2022 includes $100 million for re-establishing lab schools in Virginia. These K-12 public schools, which are separate from charter schools, had previously existed in the state and had continued to be allowed under Virginia law before Youngkin came into office, but none remained operating in the state by the start of Youngkin's term. Previous lab schools in Virginia had been established as partnerships with institutions of higher learning; only public colleges and universities with teacher training programs were allowed to enter into these partnerships. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget removed the requirement that all lab schools in the state act as teacher training programs. It also opened lab school partnerships to be formed with community colleges or certain private universities. Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears had to break a tie vote in the State Senate for this budget amendment to be approved by the General Assembly. Youngkin has additionally advocated for allowing private businesses to enter into lab school partnerships. He has said that lab schools could be either newly established or converted out of existing schools and has supported legislation that would direct the Virginia State Board of Education to "give substantial preference" to lab school applications filed by historically black colleges or universities. Under that legislation, the same preference would be given to applications seeking to establish lab schools in "underserved communities".Youngkin supports revising how Virginia public schools are funded, so that per pupil funding for any students attending lab schools in the state would go to the institutions operating the schools attended by those students instead of going to the public school boards for the districts where those students reside. An amendment proposed by Youngkin for the 2022 state budget would have enacted this plan but was not adopted by the General Assembly. After the replacement policies regarding transgender students' rights in schools were announced by the Youngkin administration, most Virginia school districts had not adopted them, with some refusing due to belief of violation of state law. Critics argue that the policies may not meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill, and may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act and a 2020 court ruling. Shortly after the policies were announced, thousands of students protested by walking out of school.

In terms of education budget, both Youngkin and McAuliffe campaigned on increasing the budget, but Youngkin's platform was criticized for lacking details and focusing more on cultural issues.

Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet this criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law. It has been reported that Youngkin's model policies may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act, which bans schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, and that Youngkin's policy mandating that students use restrooms corresponding with their biological sex may be unenforceable due to the 2020 court ruling in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, which mandates that students in Virginia be allowed to use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity.Shortly after the Youngkin administration's policies were announced, several thousand students from over ninety Virginia schools protested the policies by engaging in walkouts. Organizers of the walkouts stated that the Youngkin administration's policies "will only hurt students in a time when students are facing unparalleled mental health challenges, and are a cruel attempt to politicize the existence of LGBTQIA+ students for political gain." Education budget. Youngkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average. Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennual education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually. The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state's achievement gaps.In contrast to McAuliffe, who introduced much of his education platform concurrently with his announcement to run in the Democratic primary, Youngkin did not begin sharing proposals for state spending on education until months after securing the Republican nomination. McAuliffe criticized Youngkin for not releasing budget details until late in the campaign and argued that spending on education in Virginia could be threatened by the extent of Youngkin's tax cut proposals. The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin's education platform was "far lighter on details" than McAuliffe's and that it largely focused on cultural issues over budgetary proposals. Youngkin began offering specific proposals for education spending late in the summer of 2021, only a few months before the election. These proposals included $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.Youngkin inherited a record surplus in state revenue from Northam, which was projected to continue growing during the state's then-upcoming budget cycle. As a result of this surplus, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a biennial state budget in 2022 that committed $19.2 billion to education, a record for the state even when accounting for inflation. This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats. In exchange for getting much of their desired education spending enacted, Democrats agreed to enact several of Youngkin's tax cut proposals.Incorporated into the budget compromise was an outgoing proposal of Northam's to enact a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers. This plan was chosen over the one preferred by Republicans, which would have paired a more modest 8% salary increase for teachers over two years with 1% bonuses.School construction and maintenance received $1.25 billion in the 2022 biennial state budget. This exceeds the amount that had been allotted for these needs in Northam's outgoing budget proposals but is a small fraction of the $25 billion that the Virginia Department of Education says it would take to fully replace the state's oldest schools.The Virginia Preschool Initiative was expanded by the 2022 biennial state budget.

Politifact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms. The publication wrote, "Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students." Critics of Youngkin noted that he sent his own children to private schools where resources promoting critical race theory have been recommended. Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as "ground zero for Youngkin's victory", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as "a transphobic dog whistle".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order "targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students."This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as "a dumbing down of standards". Youngkin called the program a "left-wing takeover of public education", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes – a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign. James Lane, Virginia Superintendent at the time, and NPR, both disputed this characterization of the program. The Virginia Math Pathways Initiative would have prioritized data science and data analytics over calculus while still offering students the opportunity to enroll in calculus at an accelerated pace. Although education officials within the Northam administration explored the potential benefits of detracking students prior to the 11th grade, no plans to do so were ever adopted, and in April 2021, those officials explained that the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative was not designed to eliminate advanced math classes at any grade level. Youngkin's education platform was a major focus of his campaign, with an emphasis on parental involvement and opposition to supposed critical race theory teaching, even though fact-checkers found no evidence of it in state curriculum standards. He also opposed transgender student protections and planned to repeal related policies. His first official action as governor was to ban critical race theory in schools and related materials, and cancel the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to decrease suspension rates for Black students, promote cultural competency, and close the racial achievement gap. However, critics claimed the math initiative would have "dumbed down" standards and eliminated advanced high school math classes, though officials denied this. Youngkin also expressed intentions to address collective bargaining rights for public employees and project labor agreements. Youngkin, upon becoming governor, banned critical race theory in schools and canceled the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to shift focus to data science and analytics while still offering calculus. Critics, including education officials, disputed claims that the initiative would "dumb down" standards or eliminate advanced math classes. Later, Youngkin signed a bill allowing parents to review and opt out of material with "sexually explicit content," and urged colleges to consider political diversity in hiring. He also enlisted a conservative think tank to assist in revising history and social sciences standards, and advocated for a bill to reverse admissions process reforms aimed at increasing diversity at two Governor's Schools. Additionally, he established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools. This led to The Washington Post writing that Youngkin had "demonstrated uncommon flexibility on an issue that for others...represents a bright line." Youngkin's refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his own party has elicited criticism from some moderate Republicans, such as Liz Cheney, David Jolly, and Bill Kristol.Among the candidates Youngkin campaigned for during the midterms was former Maine governor Paul LePage, who was seeking a nonconsecutive third term in office. During his previous tenure as governor, LePage had drawn controversy for a series of comments that both Republican and Democratic politicians condemned as racist; these comments included LePage stating that "the enemy right now...are people of color or people of Hispanic origin." Youngkin initially claimed to be unaware of these comments. He later condemned the comments but defended his choice to campaign for LePage, claiming that LePage had apologized. As reported by The Washington Post, LePage had not actually apologized for most of the comments.Hours after it was reported that Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, was the victim of a politically motivated assault that left him with a fractured skull, Youngkin appeared at a campaign appearance in support of a Republican congressional candidate running in the 2022 federal midterms, where he stated, "Speaker Pelosi’s husband – they had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re gonna go do." Virginia Democrats condemned Youngkin for choosing to speak against the Pelosis so soon after the attack. When asked if he wanted to apologize for the comment, Youngkin chose not to do so but stated, "a terrible thing happened to the speaker’s husband and it should never have happened and we wish him a speedy recovery. The first lady and I keep him in our prayers." Time magazine wrote that Youngkin and other Republicans who used the assault to engage in criticism of the Pelosis had "highlighted the devolved state of American political discourse", while Don Scott, the Democratic leader in Virginia's House of Delegates, stated that Youngkin's response to the assault was part of a long trend in which he felt that "Youngkin's espoused Christian values didn't match his actions". A few days after his initial comment, Youngkin stated that he "didn't do a great job" of condemning the attack and apologized for his rhetoric in a handwritten letter to Nancy Pelosi. Approval Ratings. The following are polls of Glenn Youngkin's approval rating among Virginians.



## question

How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact?

## ground_truth

Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.

## generated_answer

Youngkin calls for better protection against pollution, supports cleaning the Chesapeake Bay, establishes a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority, revises the state's permit-issuing process, and withdraws from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

After his election, Youngkin took several actions related to the environment and energy. He withdrew Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, calling it a "carbon tax," and proposed building a small modular nuclear reactor in Southwest Virginia. He also reevaluated Virginia's membership in the initiative due to potential legal limitations. Youngkin called for better protection against pollution, support for cleaning the Chesapeake Bay, and establishing a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat sea-level rise. However, he opposed a bill aimed at improving flood preparedness and attempted to rescind a ban on single-use plastics, which environmental groups criticized. Youngkin also revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects, transferring authority from citizen review boards to the Department of Environmental Quality. In 2022, Youngkin vetoed bills related to health care, such as setting a statute of limitations on medical debt collection and prohibiting health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use, despite broad bipartisan support. His vetoes contradicted national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation. Youngkin's environmental and energy actions include withdrawing from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, proposing a nuclear reactor, and altering the permit-issuing process, which was criticized by environmental groups. He vetoed healthcare bills, contradicting national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation. In education, he reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges, facing criticism for pitting student groups against each other. Regarding LGBTQ+ rights, Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports it legally, and he hosted a private Pride event without inviting LGBTQ+ legislators, which was boycotted. He also declined to issue a Pride Month proclamation. In response to the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade, Youngkin refused to discuss hypotheticals regarding Obergefell v. Hodges. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, which would make Virginia the only US state with misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount. He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade.After winning the election, Youngkin said that he would use an executive action to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market. Youngkin has called the initiative a "carbon tax" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year; this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards.In his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to "gut" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.In April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is "a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage."Additional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were "only responsible" for permitting decisions when projects were "considered to be controversial". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.Only a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was "angering business groups". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental groups. Health care. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use. Both bills had passed the state legislature with broad bipartisan support. Youngkin explained his veto of the latter bill by claiming that such a policy would have caused higher costs for consumers. According to The Washington Post, this claim conflicted with national studies showing that the policy would have decreased costs for consumers. The publication also noted that Youngkin's veto of that bill was in opposition to "the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan study commission". Immigration. Youngkin advocates for private businesses to partner with lab schools and supports legislation that prioritizes applications from historically black colleges or universities and underserved communities. He proposed redirecting per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools, but the proposal was not adopted. In 2022, Youngkin signed laws allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, mandating digital floor plans for public schools, requiring the reporting of certain misdemeanor crimes committed by students on school grounds, and implementing measures to prevent hazing in colleges and universities. Regarding climate change, Youngkin is unclear about its cause but supports adaptation efforts and an "all of the above approach" to energy. He has withdrawn Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, citing cost savings for ratepayers, despite potential revenue loss for the state.

The drug, manufactured in clandestine labs throughout the United States and obtained from other Hells Angels chapters in multipound quantities, was delivered to Omaha in motorcycles and motorcycle parts, cars and vans. The conspiracy began in December 1972 and is suspected in the unsolved murder of Joseph Sackett, who was found dead in a field after being shot execution-style in August 1979. An eighteen-month investigation culminated in a series of raids on ten locations in Omaha, one in Council Bluffs, Iowa and another in Santa Rosa, California on February 28 in which around eighty officers from federal, state, county and municipal law enforcement agencies made six arrests and recovered a cache of rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons, as well as narcotics ranging from marijuana to cocaine. Four Hells Angels – Gary D. Apker, James "Jim Bob" Cronin, Calvin Davenport and Raymond "Buzzard" Gearhart – and Janice Fitzgerald, the widow of slain Hells Angels member Leslie Fitzgerald, were convicted of felony firearms violations and drug possession on November 30, 1981.The Omaha Police Department (OPD) initiated a three-year undercover investigation targeting a cocaine distribution network in the Omaha metropolitan area. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became involved in the investigation, called Operation Zookeeper, in July 1982. A federal grand jury indicted forty-three individuals, many of them Hells Angels, in 1983. By the end of the year, fifteen members of the drug ring had pled guilty, and many of the others were later convicted.Arrests were made during a series of coordinated raids carried out in Omaha on May 2, 1985, as part of Operation Roughrider, an FBI investigation of the Hells Angels that commenced three years prior. An undercover FBI agent, Kevin P. Bonner, infiltrated the club for twenty-six months and made drug transactions with numerous chapters as part of the investigation, which resulted in the indictments of a total of 133 Hells Angels members and associates in eleven states on narcotics trafficking and racketeering charges. The raids, involving approximately a thousand law enforcement personnel, also led to the seizure of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, hashish, PCP and LSD valued at $2 million, as well as weapons including submachine guns and anti-tank weaponry.Fifteen Hells Angels members and associates were arrested in the Omaha area on October 17, 1990, after being indicted on charges including interstate and foreign travel in support of racketeering enterprises, money laundering, manufacturing and distribution of a controlled substance, and felony possession of a firearm. The arrests, which came during a series of simultaneous raids on fourteen locations including the club's Omaha headquarters, were the culmination of a two-year investigation. The raids also resulted in confiscation of rifles, a .22 caliber automatic pistol, $800,000 worth of drugs, $200,000 in cash as well as Hells Angels paraphernalia. Hells Angels members Dale Ray Haley and Lamont Kress, the club's former East Coast regional treasurer, along with associates Timothy S. Egan, Mary Lee and Rodney Rumsey were convicted on May 15, 1992, of drug trafficking, money laundering and illegal weapons possession. Haley was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, Kress, Egan and Rumsey were sentenced to fifteen years and eight months', and Lee was sentenced to twelve years and three months'. Five others negotiated plea bargains, and another was acquitted. Nevada. The River Run Riot occurred on April 27, 2002, at the Harrah's Casino & Hotel in Laughlin, Nevada. Members of the Hells Angels and the Mongols motorcycle clubs fought each other on the casino floor. As a result, Mongol Anthony Barrera, 43, was stabbed to death, and two Hells Angels, Jeramie Bell, 27, and Robert Tumelty, 50, were shot to death. On February 23, 2007, Hells Angels members James Hannigan and Rodney Cox were sentenced to two years in prison. Cox and Hannigan were captured on videotape confronting Mongols members inside the casino. A Hells Angel member can be clearly seen on the casino security videotape performing a front kick on a Mongol biker member, causing the ensuing melee.. However, prior to this altercation, several incidents of harassment and provocation were noted in the Clark County, Nevada Grand Jury hearings as having been perpetrated upon The Hells Angels. Members of the Mongols accosted a vendor's table selling Hells Angels trademarked items, had surrounded a Hells Angel and demanded he remove club clothing. In addition, nine witnesses claimed the fight began when a Mongol kicked a member of the Hells Angels. During the investigation, the chapter's leadership transitioned from long-time Hells Angels member "Diamond" Dan Bifield to recent inductee Mark "Lightning" Baker after Bifield was voted out as president. Law enforcement began the operation when Bifield made a drug deal with an informant in 2011 and arrested twenty people — sixteen men and four women — in a series of raids in June 2012. The last of the sixteen convicted were sentenced in June 2013; the group was sentenced to more than 100 years imprisonment collectively. Virginia. Four New York metropolitan area Hells Angels members and one prospect were convicted of ambushing and wounding two southern Virginia-based Pagans members at a motel near Greenville on September 10, 2018. The attack happened as the rival gangs happened to be staying at the same motel while passing through the area, and led to one Pagan being shot and the other beaten with a hammer. Dominick J. Eadicicco and club prospect Anthony Milan pleaded guilty to malicious wounding by a mob and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and were sentenced to eight years in prison, while Nathaniel A. Villaman, Joseph Anthony Paturzo and Richard E. West all pleaded guilty to malicious wounding by a mob and were given four year sentences during the trials held in Staunton in January and February 2019. Washington. The Hells Angels founded a Washington state Nomads chapter on 16 July 1994.In 2001 Hells Angels Rodney Lee Rollness, a former Hells Angel, and Joshua Binder murdered Michael "Santa" Walsh, who had allegedly falsely claimed to be a member of the Hells Angels. Paul Foster, hoping to join the Hells Angels, aided in the murder by luring Walsh to a party at his house and helping cover up the crime. West Coast leader Richard "Smilin' Rick" Fabel, along with Rollness and Binder, were also convicted of various racketeering offenses. After the Hells Angels' involvement in drug trafficking and collaborations with the Patriarca crime family, several incidents occurred involving the motorcycle club. In 2002, Christopher J. Brennan, a Pagans member, was charged with attempted murder but served 90 days for reckless endangerment. In 2003, four Hells Angels were arrested in a nationwide investigation, with charges including drug and firearm possession. Violent incidents in the club's history include a 1969 battle with police and a 1975 kidnapping.

Following these incidents, several Hells Angels members were accused of various crimes. Leary was charged with assault and battery but acquitted. Two members were accused of raping a woman in 2004. Costin and Duda pleaded guilty to assaulting an off-duty police lieutenant in a bar. Ranieri fled from police during a traffic stop but was later arrested. Franco, a member with a criminal record, was found with a firearm and ammunition in 2011 and sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2013 for possessing a firearm after a felony conviction.

In 2013, two members of the Salem Hells Angels chapter and two members of the Red Devils, a Hells Angels support club, were arrested for kidnapping, mayhem, and extortion. The victim was assaulted with a ball-peen hammer, causing permanent injury, and forced to resign from the Red Devils. Barr, Eliason, Weymouth, and DeFronzo pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit violent crimes in 2015 and were sentenced to imprisonment.

The Hells Angels were also involved in a conflict with Lucifer's Henchmen MC in 1974, resulting in the fatal shooting of David A. Urban and the wounding of Mark W. Veherbon. The murder remains unsolved, but Lynn police believe it was due to a conflict over an incident at a local café. The conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded as a result of the investigation. Murder of Cynthia Garcia. On October 27, 2001, full-patch Hells Angels members Kevin J. Augustiniak and Michael Christopher "Mesa Mike" Kramer, and prospective member Paul Merle Eischeid murdered Cynthia Yvonne Garcia, a forty-four-year-old mother of six who verbally disrespected the club and its members while in an intoxicated state during a party at the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Mesa. After beating Garcia unconscious, the three bikers loaded her into the trunk of a car and drove her into the desert near the Salt River where they stabbed her twenty-seven times and attempted to decapitate her. Garcia's body was discovered on October 31. Kramer contacted ATF agent John Ciccone the following month and, without disclosing his crime, offered to become an informant. After moving to Los Angeles, California and infiltrating the club's San Fernando Valley chapter by posing as an Arizona drug runner, Kramer offered the ATF information on Garcia's killing in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Fourteen months after becoming an informant, he signed a plea agreement to serve five years of probation for the murder. Eischeid fled the country following his indictment for the killing in 2007 and was placed on the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was apprehended in the San Isidro district of Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 3, 2011, after being tracked by the USMS, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and Interpol. Eischeid was extradited to Arizona in July 2018 after exhausting all of his appeals in the Argentine legal system. Augustiniak pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in October 2011 and was sentenced to twenty-three years and six months' imprisonment on March 30, 2012. Conflict with the Mongols. Joshua William Harber, a member of the Hells Angels chapter in Ventura, California, was shot in the face outside a bar in Cave Creek on June 8, 2002, and died later that day at John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix. Harber's unidentified killer fled the scene in a car after the shooting. While Phoenix Police Department detectives investigated several motives for the murder, including the possibility of retaliation by the Mongols for the killing of a Mongol by the Hells Angels at the River Run riot in Laughlin, Nevada on April 27, 2002, the crime has become a cold case.Cave Creek Hells Angels chapter president Daniel Leroy "Hoover" Seybert was shot to death outside a bar in Phoenix on March 22, 2003. The autopsy report showed that Seybert was shot in the head at close range by a small caliber handgun which was located during the investigation in Seybert's back pocket. The homicide has never been solved and there have been various theories regarding the reason for Seybert's killing. It has been speculated that he was killed by the Mongols, by the Hells Angels as part of an internal conflict, or by the ATF in relation to Operation Black Biscuit. Two days after Seybert's death, a Mongols member was stabbed in the back and wounded at a gas station in Reno, Nevada by a suspected Hells Angels member in a possible revenge attack.Seven Hells Angels – including the Tucson chapter president, the former Mesa chapter president and other leaders – were arrested in Arizona on various charges on December 3, 2003, following a two-year investigation of the club by the ATF. Five of those were indicted at the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on federal racketeering and firearms charges stemming from the River Run riot. The raids in Arizona were carried out as part of a coordinated operation which led to the arrests of at least fifty-five Hells Angels members and associates in five Western states by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Two Arizona Angels – Rodney Cox and Calvin Schaefer – were among six HAMC members convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to stand trial. Schaefer was sentenced to four years and three months in a federal prison on January 12, 2007, for committing a violent crime in the aid of racketeering. Cox was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on February 23, 2007, after pleading guilty to the same charge. Charges were dismissed against thirty-six others.Patrick Michael Eberhardt, treasurer of the Hells Angels' Cave Creek chapter, was shot dead and a club hangaround was wounded when a group of six Hells Angels were fired upon while riding their motorcycles in Phoenix on February 7, 2015.

No one has ever been arrested in the case, which police consider an open investigation.Hells Angels associate Howard Hammer was contracted by loanshark James Broderick III to collect a $1,500 loan from a delinquent debtor in late December 2015. When the individual failed to pay the debt and falsely claimed to be the acting president of the New York Hells Angels chapter, he was stabbed eight times, beaten with a hammer and blinded in one eye in a New Milford hotel room on January 25, 2016. Broderick and Hammer were arrested on May 27, 2016. Hammer refused to identify those involved in the assault, although an investigation revealed that members of the Hells Angels' Bridgeport chapter had attacked the victim in connection with the extortion scheme. Hammer pleaded guilty to conspiracy to participate in the collection and attempted collection of an extension of credit by extortionate means on December 2, 2016, and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years' imprisonment on June 1, 2017. Broderick pleaded guilty to the same charge on December 7, 2016, and was sentenced to two years' on June 29, 2017. Racketeering. Daniel Bifield and two Bridgeport Hells Angels associates, including Daniel's father Richard Bifield, were convicted of conspiring to make and collect extortionate loans, and Hobbs Act violations on August 4, 1981, for their involvement in a loansharking operation headed by Francis "Fat Franny" Curcio, a made member of the Genovese crime family. As an inmate awaiting sentencing, Daniel Bifield and three others escaped from the Bridgeport Correctional Center on September 23, 1981. He became the subject of an international manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and, at one point, a body found in the East River in New York City was incorrectly identified as that of Bifield. After spending several weeks in the United States, he fled to the Bahamas. Successfully managing to elude his pursuers, Bifield finally returned to the U.S. in late January 1982 and went to Denver, Colorado, where he was eventually apprehended by United States Marshals Service (USMS) and FBI agents on February 5, 1982. Bifield was sentenced two weeks after his capture to two consecutive twenty-year prison sentences on the extortion charge. He was then found guilty on June 10, 1982, of escape from the custody of the United States Attorney General, and was sentenced to an additional five years' imprisonment to be served consecutively.Thirty-seven members and associates of the Bridgeport Hells Angels were arrested on racketeering and drug trafficking charges on May 2, 1985, in connection with a three-year FBI investigation of the club known as Operation Roughrider. The arrests took place in three cities across Connecticut. Among those indicted was an officer of the Bridgeport PD, Joseph Seamons. Two law enforcement officers were injured during the raids; state trooper Angel Gonzalez was wounded when a suspect fired at him through the door of a house in Stratford, and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official suffered a broken toe while using a sledgehammer to break through an armored clubhouse door in Bridgeport. An undercover FBI agent, Kevin P. Bonner, infiltrated the club for over two years and made drug deals with various chapters during the investigation. The operation involved around a thousand law enforcement personnel, and resulted in the arrests of a total of 133 Hells Angels members and associates during approximately fifty coordinated raids carried out in eleven states. The raids also led to the seizure of $2.6 million worth of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, hashish, PCP and LSD, as well as weapons including Uzi submachine guns and rocket launchers. Thirty-five of those charged were convicted – including Roger "Bear" Mariani, Robert "Red Dog" Redmann and Joseph Whelan, who were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. One Hells Angel, Robert Banning, became a cooperating witness. In 1986, detective Nicholas Barone of the Connecticut State Police received intelligence indicating that he and H. James Pickerstein, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, were to be physically harmed by the HAMC in retaliation for their efforts in the investigation and subsequent prosecutions. These attempts at violence were to be funded by the Hells Angels' Oakland, California chapter. As a result, Barone was subject to intense security for an extended period of time. Illinois. Sosa died of multiple head and internal injuries, and his body was found in the back of his parked car by three passing youths the following afternoon. Three other Hells Angels – Jack Forbes, Russell J. Kutzer and Carlos Pini – were later apprehended on the same charges.Bridgeport Hells Angels members Frank D'Amato and Salvatore Saffioti were killed and another, Donald "Big Red" Meredith, was left wounded in critical condition when they were shot with a .44 Magnum carbine by Donald E. Krosky after they forced their way into a hotel and bar in Sandy Hook, Newtown on July 31, 1975. The three Hells Angels, armed with knives, had been contracted by the building's owner Charles Framularo to evict Krosky, who rented and managed the premises. Krosky, who was associated with the rival Huns Motorcycle Club, was charged with two counts of murder and one count of assault with intent to murder on November 10, 1975; he was freed on a $100,000 bail bond.

Bartolomeo then killed another Devil's Disciples member, William "Cat" Michaels, on July 29, 1995. Michaels was riding his motorcycle on Route 18 in Weymouth when Bartolomeo accelerated an automobile into him. The operation culminated with the arrests of sixteen Hells Angels members and associates during raids on ten locations, including the Salem chapter clubhouse, on September 5, 1996. Quantities of cocaine and methamphetamine were also seized. All sixteen people indicted were convicted. Domey was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment in 1997 after pleading guilty to running a criminal enterprise that sold cocaine and methamphetamine.

Thirteen Hells Angels members and a fourteenth man affiliated with the Destroyers motorcycle gang were ultimately indicted on charges of assault, kidnapping, robbery, motor vehicle theft and chop shop activity in relation to a Denver-based organized crime ring. The five-month investigation into the ring involved eleven state and federal law enforcement agencies, and began in July 2019 after former HAMC member Joshua O'Bryan began offering investigators details on the Denver chapter's alleged involvement with interstate drug trafficking, gunrunning, prostitution and money laundering. O'Bryan allegedly survived an ambush by a group of Hells Angels at a stashhouse in Erie on June 28, 2019, after he was expelled from the club due to suspicions he was cooperating with law enforcement, which emerged when he was arrested on firearms charges following a police raid on his motorcycle shop in Lakewood.

Oregon. Police have stated that the Hells Angels have avoided Oregon since 1967, when the state was ceded to the Gypsy Jokers to quell a San Francisco, California-area drug war between the clubs.Hells Angels prospect Robert "Bugeye Bob" McClure was convicted of quadruple murder and sentenced to four consecutive life terms in July 1994 for the shootings of Margo Compton, her six-year-old twin daughters, Sylvia and Sandra, and Gary Seslar, the son of her boyfriend, in Gaston on August 7, 1977. McClure's alleged accomplice in the killings, Hells Angels hangaround Benjamin "Psycho" Silva, was never charged in the case; prosecutors felt it wasn't worth the expense and effort as he was already on death row for the 1981 kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of two college students in Lassen County, California. Odis "Buck" Garrett, the Hells Angels Vallejo, California chapter president, ordered the killings of Compton and her daughters in retaliation for her testimony against several Hells Angels in a 1976 San Francisco prostitution trial. Garrett, a one-time millionaire methamphetamine dealer already serving a life term in California on a narcotics conviction, was found guilty on four counts of murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences in prison in July 1995. Garrett died in prison aged seventy-four on February 12, 2017. Pennsylvania. An alliance between the Pagans and the Philadelphia crime family has historically prevented the Hells Angels from establishing a presence in the Philadelphia area. In March 2002, a South Philadelphia tattoo parlor owned by a Pagans member who had been involved in a brawl with the Hells Angels on Long Island, New York the previous month was firebombed in what authorities suspect was a retaliatory attack by the Angels. A HAMC member was stabbed numerous times during a fight between the rival clubs in Northeast Philadelphia in November 2002. The unattended clubhouse of the Sons of Satan, a Pagans support club, was destroyed by a pipe bomb explosion in Rapho Township on December 13, 2002. The case has yet to be officially solved, although authorities believe it to be the work of the Hells Angels.A HAMC chapter was formed in West Philadelphia in 2004 after four high-ranking Pagans members – Mark "Slow Poke" Mangano, Anthony "Mint-Condition" Mengine, Thomas "Thinker" Wood and James "Slim Jim" Wysong – patched over the year before. On January 1, 2005, Hells Angels member Vincent "Honcho" Heinrich was airlifted to Cooper University Hospital after being assaulted by a group of Pagans outside a bar in Woodland Township, New Jersey, allegedly prompting the Angels' New York-based East Coast leader John "The Baptist" Lo Franco to declare war on the Philadelphia Pagans chapter. Wood, the Philadelphia Hells Angels vice-president, was shot dead while driving his GMC pickup truck on the Schuylkill Expressway after he and fellow HAMC member Byron "B&E" Evans departed a go-go bar in the early hours of January 15, 2005. Two men in a Chevrolet Suburban began firing at Evans, who was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and Wood swerved in an attempt to shield Evans when he was fatally shot in the head. Pagans members Robert "Go Fast" Gray and Steven "Gorilla" Mondevergine were questioned by police in relation to the murder, which has gone unsolved. On October 31, 2005, Pagans members allegedly stole a sign standing in front of the Hells Angels' clubhouse, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. The Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter, consisting of twelve members and approximately five prospects, was disbanded during a meeting in New York on November 18, 2005. Law enforcement believe the demise of the chapter was a result of poor leadership by LoFranco, who ordered the outmatched Hells Angels to carry out a war against the better-established Pagans. Rhode Island. The Hells Angels' Rhode Island chapter was formed in Providence on September 5, 1992. The Hells Angels have established a working relationship with the Providence faction of the Patriarca crime family, acting as enforcers for the Mafia.Christian A. Rufino, a member of the New Rochelle, New York ("New Roc City") chapter of the Hells Angels, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison after being convicted on a federal firearms charge in April 2012. Thirty-five of those charged were convicted – including Roger "Bear" Mariani, Robert "Red Dog" Redmann and Joseph Whelan, who were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. One Hells Angel, Robert Banning, became a cooperating witness. In 1986, detective Nicholas Barone of the Connecticut State Police received intelligence indicating that he and H. James Pickerstein, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, were to be physically harmed by the HAMC in retaliation for their efforts in the investigation and subsequent prosecutions. These attempts at violence were to be funded by the Hells Angels' Oakland, California chapter. As a result, Barone was subject to intense security for an extended period of time. Illinois. Four leading members of the Hells Angels in northern Illinois were arrested and charged with numerous crimes including violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 2005, following a four-year federal investigation into the club. At least three were convicted; Melvin "Road" Chancey (president of the Chicago chapter from 1997 to 1999) was sentenced to nine years in prison, David G. "Pulley" Ohlendorf (president of the Spring Valley chapter from 2003) was sentenced to four years in prison and Richard A. Abrams (a former president of both the Rockford and Spring Valley chapters) was sentenced to three years in prison during trials in June and July 2006. Their group carried out the June 25, 1994 shooting of a rival club president in Cook County, threatened to bomb a rival gang's clubhouse in Kankakee in March 1995, and planned two murders in Peoria and Joliet, crimes they committed to protect sales of cocaine and methamphetamine with a street value of $624,000 from 1993 through 2002. Indiana. In 2016, law enforcement received public backlash for heavily patrolling the area where the HAMC was holding a charity for educational programs for children with special needs. Citizens took issue with authorities summoning the Chicago area's SWAT team and helicopter unit for the relatively small bike night, which attracted about eighty motorcycles to the small bar where the event was hosted. One HAMC member summed up the public's feelings in an interview:. "As far as what we view as the excessive law enforcement build-up that's always present at our events, they've made it clear to us that they don't want motorcycle clubs in Porter County ... We do understand the need for law enforcement in our society, however what happened Thursday night was a waste of their talents and a waste of our tax dollars.". The Angel then once again reaffirmed that the main purpose of his club was for men to ride motorcycles together and that this was a purely charitable event. He then spoke about how his chapter is working to support the communities that support his club. Kentucky. In October 1988, Ralph "Sonny" Barger, the Hells Angels' Oakland (California) chapter president and reputed national leader, and Michael Vincent "Irish" O'Farrell, the former Oakland president, were convicted of plotting to carry out bomb attacks in Louisville and elsewhere against members of the Outlaws. Three other club members were also found guilty on lesser charges, while five others were acquitted. The government contended the Hells Angels planned the attacks in revenge for the murder of John Cleve Webb, a member of Hells Angels' Anchorage (Alaska) chapter, who was shot outside a Jefferson County bar on August 12, 1986. A Louisville Outlaws member later pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in Webb's death. Maryland. Pagans member Christopher J. Brennan shot and wounded three Hells Angels at a bar in Deale on May 30, 2002, when he fired shots from a van with a .32 caliber pistol. Brennan pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and was sentenced to ninety days in jail in November 2002 after prosecutors dropped additional other charges, which included attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, due to "a distinct lack of witness cooperation".Three members of the North Beach Hells Angels chapter – chapter president John Anthony Beal, vice-president Lewis James Hall and Cornelius Wood Alexander, as well as Hall's wife Traecy Eugenia Hall – were indicted on federal drug and firearm charges, and were arrested by the ATF during a series of simultaneous raids on July 24, 2003. Federal agents uncovered seventeen firearms, over 270 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest and methamphetamine during the raids. According to affidavits filed in federal court, two undercover ATF agents who had infiltrated the Warlocks witnessed Beal sell cocaine to two Warlocks members at the Hells Angels' clubhouse on May 3, 2003. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover the entrance to the New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains nobody knows how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door. A club lawyer said they intended to sue the city of New York for false arrest and possible civil rights violations. Drug trafficking. A methamphetamine trafficking network run by members and associates of the Hells Angels' Rochester chapter operating in Western New York from 2002 through July 9, 2010 was dismantled after an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Genesee County Sheriff's Office, the New York State Police, the City of Batavia Police Department, and the Village of LeRoy Police Department. James Henry McAuley, Jr., the vice-president of the Rochester chapter and the leader of the drug ring, was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison in July 2016. Richard W. Mar, the former president of the club's Monterey (California) chapter, supplied the Rochester Hells Angels with methamphetamine and trafficked the drug to New York from California; he was sentenced to ten years in federal prison in August 2016. Rochester Hells Angels members Richard E. Riedman and Jeffrey A. Tyler, and three associates – Donna Boon (McAuley's wife), Gordon Montgomery and Paul Griffin – pleaded guilty to drug trafficking offenses based on their roles in the conspiracy; Riedman was sentenced to thirty-seven months in prison, Tyler to eighteen months in prison, Boon to three years probation and twelve months of home incarceration, Montgomery to sixty months in prison, and Griffin to probation.

Stone was sentenced to twelve months in prison on charges related to the case. North Carolina. North Carolina's first Hells Angels chapter was founded in Durham on July 24, 1973. This was then followed by the Charlotte chapter, which was chartered on October 19, 1978, and was formed by Michael Franklin "Thunder" Finazzo – a member of the Hells Angels' elite "Filthy Few" from Omaha, Nebraska – and others. Charlotte was home to numerous motorcycle gangs at the time, including the Outlaws, but under Finazzo's leadership, the Hells Angels were able to take control of much of the city's criminal rackets and operated drug, prostitution and motorcycle theft rings throughout the state. During the Hells Angels' international rally held at a private campground on Kerr Lake on July 4, 1981, journalists covering the event for The Charlotte Observer were assaulted by Hells Angels members. Staff reporters Robin Clark and Tex O'Neill were punched and photographer Mark Sluder was forced to turn over his film at knifepoint. The attack was stopped when O'Neill alerted FBI agents who were also observing the rally. Michael Finazzo and his lieutenant Tyler Duris "Yank" Frndak were found shot dead and stuffed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile 88 in Randolph County on September 26, 1981. At the time, Finazzo was considered by police to be among the ten most powerful members of the club. Although the murders remain unsolved, police believe that the killings were related to a feud with the Outlaws or a power struggle within the Hells Angels. Club members from across the United States, as well as Canada, Denmark, England and the Netherlands, attended the burials of both men, which took place in Marshville on October 1, 1981. Finazzo's successor as chapter president, Fred Martin Scarnechia, and another Hells Angel, Thomas Lee Campbell, pistol-whipped undercover DEA agent John Landrum amidst a scuffle during a drug deal sting operation, in which Scarnechia was also stabbed, at Scarnechia's home in Fort Mill, South Carolina on July 27, 1982. Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an explosive ordnance disposal unit from the Fort Jackson Army base was required to disarm the trap. Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting the federal agent on January 6, 1983. The Hells Angels have been involved in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, violence, and murder. In addition to the incidents mentioned in the previous text, in the 1980s and 1990s, authorities conducted several operations against the Hells Angels, resulting in the seizure of large quantities of illegal drugs, weapons, and the arrest and conviction of numerous members. These operations involved the infiltration of the club, undercover purchases of drugs, and the use of informants. Some members were sentenced to prison for possession and distribution of drugs, while others were sentenced as part of racketeering and loansharking investigations. Some government witnesses entered the Federal Witness Protection Program. The Hells Angels also took over criminal activities previously overseen by the Patriarca crime family's Boston faction. In 2007, a joint investigation by several law enforcement agencies resulted in the arrests of six club members on various charges. One member was sentenced to prison for possessing a firearm and a silencer. The Hells Angels' criminal activities have resulted in severe consequences for its members and have required significant law enforcement efforts to combat.

However, prior to this altercation, several incidents of harassment and provocation were noted in the Clark County, Nevada Grand Jury hearings as having been perpetrated upon The Hells Angels. Members of the Mongols accosted a vendor's table selling Hells Angels trademarked items, had surrounded a Hells Angel and demanded he remove club clothing. In addition, nine witnesses claimed the fight began when a Mongol kicked a member of the Hells Angels. Regardless of which minor physical incident can be said to have "caused the melee", it is clear that The Hells Angels had come to confront the Mongols concerning their actions..

Fitzgerald's killer was acquitted of second-degree murder by reason of self-defense.Jay Witt was sentenced to thirty-to-forty years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of manslaughter, use of a weapon and possession of a weapon by a prohibited person in connection with the death of Hells Angels member William "Willy" John Furlong, who died after being shot three times at the Omaha chapter's clubhouse on July 14, 2013. Witt died at the Nebraska State Penitentiary on September 25, 2019, aged fifty-three. Murders. Hells Angels member Orval Hinz, along with Ronald Eugene Kirby and Robert Walker, was charged with first-degree murder after Gilbert Arthur Batten, Jr. was shot in the head and killed at a house in Omaha on September 20, 1968. Kirby – who was in a dispute with Batten's acquaintance James Lynch over a woman named Judy Dunbar – testified that Hinz and Walker accompanied him as he went to Lynch's home armed with a .22 caliber survival rifle, and that Batten was killed when the rifle accidentally fired as the trio assaulted Batten and Lynch. The Hells Angels have been involved in various criminal activities, including murder and drug trafficking. In Nebraska, members Orval Hinz, Ronald Eugene Kirby, and Robert Walker were charged with first-degree murder after Gilbert Arthur Batten, Jr. was shot in 1968. Thomas Edward "Red" Nesbitt was convicted of murdering Mary Kay Harmer in 1975. The Hells Angels have also been involved in methamphetamine distribution, with a conspiracy in Omaha using violence to monopolize the trade. This resulted in the arrests of ten members and associates in 1981 and the unsolved murder of Joseph Sackett in 1979. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs set up a front operation in Omaha in 1969, leading to arrests and convictions of Hells Angels members for selling narcotics. These criminal activities have resulted in severe consequences for its members and have required significant law enforcement efforts to combat. (119 words) Thirty-five of those charged were convicted – including Roger "Bear" Mariani, Robert "Red Dog" Redmann and Joseph Whelan, who were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. One Hells Angel, Robert Banning, became a cooperating witness. In 1986, detective Nicholas Barone of the Connecticut State Police received intelligence indicating that he and H. James Pickerstein, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, were to be physically harmed by the HAMC in retaliation for their efforts in the investigation and subsequent prosecutions. These attempts at violence were to be funded by the Hells Angels' Oakland, California chapter. As a result, Barone was subject to intense security for an extended period of time. Illinois. Four leading members of the Hells Angels in northern Illinois were arrested and charged with numerous crimes including violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 2005, following a four-year federal investigation into the club. At least three were convicted; Melvin "Road" Chancey (president of the Chicago chapter from 1997 to 1999) was sentenced to nine years in prison, David G. "Pulley" Ohlendorf (president of the Spring Valley chapter from 2003) was sentenced to four years in prison and Richard A. Abrams (a former president of both the Rockford and Spring Valley chapters) was sentenced to three years in prison during trials in June and July 2006. Their group carried out the June 25, 1994 shooting of a rival club president in Cook County, threatened to bomb a rival gang's clubhouse in Kankakee in March 1995, and planned two murders in Peoria and Joliet, crimes they committed to protect sales of cocaine and methamphetamine with a street value of $624,000 from 1993 through 2002. Indiana. In 2016, law enforcement received public backlash for heavily patrolling the area where the HAMC was holding a charity for educational programs for children with special needs. Citizens took issue with authorities summoning the Chicago area's SWAT team and helicopter unit for the relatively small bike night, which attracted about eighty motorcycles to the small bar where the event was hosted. One HAMC member summed up the public's feelings in an interview:. "As far as what we view as the excessive law enforcement build-up that's always present at our events, they've made it clear to us that they don't want motorcycle clubs in Porter County ... We do understand the need for law enforcement in our society, however what happened Thursday night was a waste of their talents and a waste of our tax dollars.". The Angel then once again reaffirmed that the main purpose of his club was for men to ride motorcycles together and that this was a purely charitable event. He then spoke about how his chapter is working to support the communities that support his club. Kentucky. In October 1988, Ralph "Sonny" Barger, the Hells Angels' Oakland (California) chapter president and reputed national leader, and Michael Vincent "Irish" O'Farrell, the former Oakland president, were convicted of plotting to carry out bomb attacks in Louisville and elsewhere against members of the Outlaws. Three other club members were also found guilty on lesser charges, while five others were acquitted. The government contended the Hells Angels planned the attacks in revenge for the murder of John Cleve Webb, a member of Hells Angels' Anchorage (Alaska) chapter, who was shot outside a Jefferson County bar on August 12, 1986. A Louisville Outlaws member later pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in Webb's death. Maryland. Pagans member Christopher J. Brennan shot and wounded three Hells Angels at a bar in Deale on May 30, 2002, when he fired shots from a van with a .32 caliber pistol. Brennan pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and was sentenced to ninety days in jail in November 2002 after prosecutors dropped additional other charges, which included attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, due to "a distinct lack of witness cooperation".Three members of the North Beach Hells Angels chapter – chapter president John Anthony Beal, vice-president Lewis James Hall and Cornelius Wood Alexander, as well as Hall's wife Traecy Eugenia Hall – were indicted on federal drug and firearm charges, and were arrested by the ATF during a series of simultaneous raids on July 24, 2003. Federal agents uncovered seventeen firearms, over 270 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest and methamphetamine during the raids. According to affidavits filed in federal court, two undercover ATF agents who had infiltrated the Warlocks witnessed Beal sell cocaine to two Warlocks members at the Hells Angels' clubhouse on May 3, 2003. After the Hells Angels' involvement in drug trafficking and collaborations with the Patriarca crime family, several incidents occurred involving the motorcycle club. In 2002, Christopher J. Brennan, a Pagans member, was charged with attempted murder but served 90 days for reckless endangerment. In 2003, four Hells Angels were arrested in a nationwide investigation, with charges including drug and firearm possession. Violent incidents in the club's history include a 1969 battle with police and a 1975 kidnapping.

Following these incidents, several Hells Angels members were accused of various crimes. Leary was charged with assault and battery but acquitted. Two members were accused of raping a woman in 2004. Costin and Duda pleaded guilty to assaulting an off-duty police lieutenant in a bar. Ranieri fled from police during a traffic stop but was later arrested. Franco, a member with a criminal record, was found with a firearm and ammunition in 2011 and sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2013 for possessing a firearm after a felony conviction.

In 2013, two members of the Salem Hells Angels chapter and two members of the Red Devils, a Hells Angels support club, were arrested for kidnapping, mayhem, and extortion. The victim was assaulted with a ball-peen hammer, causing permanent injury, and forced to resign from the Red Devils. Barr, Eliason, Weymouth, and DeFronzo pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit violent crimes in 2015 and were sentenced to imprisonment.

The Hells Angels were also involved in a conflict with Lucifer's Henchmen MC in 1974, resulting in the fatal shooting of David A. Urban and the wounding of Mark W. Veherbon. The murder remains unsolved, but Lynn police believe it was due to a conflict over an incident at a local café.

These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983–84 season, which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.In February 1982, NBC canceled Tom Snyder's The Tomorrow Show and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian David Letterman. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his weekday morning talk show effort for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), Late Night with David Letterman proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise that continues to this day.. In 1984, the huge success of The Cosby Show led to a renewed interest in sitcoms, while Family Ties and Cheers, both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings (the latter ranking at near dead last among all network shows during the 1982–83 season), saw their viewership increase from having Cosby as a lead-in. The network rose from third place to second in the ratings during the 1984–85 season and reached first place in 1985–86, with hits The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, 227, Night Court, Highway to Heaven, and Hunter. The network's upswing continued late into the decade with ALF, Amen, Matlock, L.A. Law, The Hogan Family, A Different World, Empty Nest, Unsolved Mysteries, and In the Heat of the Night. In 1986, Bob Wright was appointed as chairman of NBC.. In 1985, NBC became the first American television network to broadcast programs in stereo. NBC started repairing its old affiliations that were previously wooed by ABC, such as Savannah, Temple and Columbia, followed by Jacksonville in 1988. It also repaired WOWT, a station formerly affiliated with CBS, in 1986.In the fall of 1987, NBC conceived a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations, under the brand "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", consisting of five sitcoms that each aired once a week, and were produced by various production companies contracted by NBC. The series included Marblehead Manor (from Paramount Television, airing Mondays), centering on a mansion owner and the people who live with him; She's the Sheriff (from Lorimar-Telepictures and airing Tuesdays), a comeback vehicle for Suzanne Somers which cast her as a widowed county sheriff; a series adapted from the George S. Kaufman play You Can't Take It with You (airing Wednesdays), starring Harry Morgan; Out of This World (from MCA Television and airing Thursdays), which starred Maureen Flannigan as a teenager born to an alien father and human mother that develops supernatural abilities on her 13th birthday; and a revival of the short-lived 1983 NBC series We Got It Made (produced by Fred Silverman for MGM Television and closing out the week on Fridays), as part of an ongoing trend at the time in which former network series were revived in first-run syndication. The sitcom checkerboard concept was first tested on station KCRA in Sacramento early in 1986, and consists of five different shows in the checkerboard pattern, such as The New Gidget, One Big Family, Mama's Family, Throb and It's a Living (two of these, as Mama's Family and It's a Living are syndicated revivals of the network sitcoms that were axed early in the decade).The package was aimed at attracting viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, 7:00 p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived as a result of the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30 p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Under Fred Silverman's leadership at NBC, the network faced difficulties in producing hits and maintaining affiliate stations, with many of the shows he greenlit failing to gain popularity. This led to several NBC affiliates defecting to other networks, particularly in smaller markets like Yuma, Arizona, where it took many years to get another local NBC affiliate. The network's cancellation of the 1980 Summer Olympics coverage further exacerbated its problems. Silverman's leadership was heavily criticized, both externally and internally, leading to his resignation in 1981.

Grant Tinker and Brandon Tartikoff took over and inherited a schedule with aging dramas and few sitcoms. Tartikoff demonstrated patience with promising programs, such as Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, and Cheers, which had poor ratings but desirable demographics. The A-Team became the network's biggest hit during this period.

In 1982, NBC gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to David Letterman, who launched Late Night with David Letterman, which proved successful and served as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise. The Cosby Show's success in 1984 led to renewed interest in sitcoms, and Family Ties and Cheers saw increased viewership due to Cosby as a lead-in. In Wheeling, NBC ultimately upgraded its affiliation when it partnered with WTOV-TV in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, overtaking former affiliate WTRF-TV in the ratings by a large margin. Other smaller television markets like Yuma, Arizona waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate (first with KIVA, and later KYMA). The stations in Baltimore, Columbia, Dayton, Jacksonville, Savannah, and Temple, however, have since rejoined the network, although El Dorado went to a full-time Fox affiliate after a long association with ABC, Green Bay switched to CBS several years after being associated with ABC, and Bakersfield, where it went to ABC several years after it was a CBS affiliate. In case of Rapid City, the KOTA calls now resist on a station owned by Gray Television.After President Jimmy Carter pulled the U.S. team out of the 1980 Summer Olympics, NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network's future in doubt. It had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.The press was merciless towards Silverman, but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC's "Proud as a Peacock" image campaign created a parody song called "Loud as a Peacock", which was broadcast on Don Imus' program on WNBC radio in New York. Its lyrics blamed Silverman for the network's problems ("The Peacock's dead, so thank you, Fred"). An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, though technology eventually allowed its wide propagation to the Internet in later generations from a few remaining copies. Saturday Night Live writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled "A Limo For A Lame-O", where he presented a chart with the top-10 rated programs for that season and commented that there was "not one N" on the list. Silverman later admitted he "never liked Al Franken to begin with", and the sketch ruined Franken's chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of SNL following his 1980 departure (with the position going to Jean Doumanian, who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985). Tartikoff's turnaround. Fred Silverman eventually resigned as entertainment president in the summer of 1981. Grant Tinker, a highly regarded producer who co-founded MTM Enterprises with his former wife Mary Tyler Moore, became the president of the network while Brandon Tartikoff became the president of the entertainment division. Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms, but showed patience with promising programs. One such show was the critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues, which suffered from poor ratings during its first season. Rather than canceling the show, he moved the Emmy Award-winning police drama from Steven Bochco to Thursdays, where its ratings improved dramatically. He used the same tactics with St. Elsewhere and Cheers. Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher-rated competition because of their desirable demographics, upscale adults ages 18–34. While the network claimed moderate successes with Gimme a Break!, Silver Spoons, Knight Rider, and Remington Steele, its biggest hit during this period was The A-Team, which, at 10th place, was the network's only program to rank in the Nielsen Top-20 for the 1982–83 season, and ascended to fourth place the following year. These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983–84 season, which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.In February 1982, NBC canceled Tom Snyder's The Tomorrow Show and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian David Letterman. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his weekday morning talk show effort for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), Late Night with David Letterman proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise that continues to this day..

The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.. That year, in 1987, NBC is planning on to increase output of in-house productions for next year, such as a series of half-hour dramedies, and made an experimental sitcom lineup for Thanksgiving weekend (November 29) that would consist of four sitcoms on the lineup, which consists of Night Court, Beverly Hills Buntz, Family Ties and My Two Dads, and the low ratings for NBC's daytime lineup caused by the creation of the new soap opera that was set for spring 1988, Generations. At the same time, NBC confirms its plans to integrate its NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications, with Enterprises merchandising and foreign sales becoming part of NBC-TV and guest relations and studio tours were added to the Corporate Communications branch, and a new operation service, NBC Operations & Services was created.NBC aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. The 1988–89 season saw NBC have an astounding 17 series in Nielsen's year-end Top 30 most-watched network programs; it also ranked at first place in the weekly ratings for more than 12 months, an unprecedented achievement that has not been duplicated since. 1989 however, also served as NBC's final year of covering Major League Baseball (the primary package would move over to CBS for the next four years before NBC regained the rights), having done so in some shape or form since 1947. Nevertheless, the network continued its hot streak into the early 1990s with new hits such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Blossom, and Law & Order. "Must See TV". In 1991, Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment to take an executive position at Paramount Pictures. In the course of a decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. Some blamed Littlefield for losing David Letterman to CBS after naming Jay Leno as the successor to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, following the latter's retirement as host in May 1992. Things turned around with the launches of new hit series such as Mad About You, Wings, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER and Will & Grace.. One of Tartikoff's late acquisitions, Seinfeld initially struggled from its debut in 1989 as a summer series, but grew to become one of NBC's top-rated shows after it was moved to Thursdays in the time slot following Cheers. Seinfeld ended its run in 1998, becoming the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings for a single television season. Only two other shows had finished their runs at the top of the ratings, I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show. Consequently, Friends emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast. It dominated the ratings, never leaving the top five watched shows of the year from its second through tenth seasons and landing on the number-one spot during season eight in the 2001–02 season as the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings. Cheers spinoff Frasier became a critical and commercial success, usually landing in the Nielsen Top 20 – although its ratings were overshadowed to a minor extent by Friends – and went on to win numerous Emmy Awards (eventually setting a record for a sitcom that lasted until it was overtaken by Modern Family in 2014).

NBC's comedy offerings experienced success in the 2015-16 season with the debut of "Superstore" and the continued success of "The Blacklist" and the Chicago franchise. The network also found a hit in the comedy-drama "This Is Us" in the 2016-17 season. During the 2017-18 season, NBC saw further success with "Ellen's Game of Games" and the return of "Will & Grace." The network also premiered several shows in the 2018-19 season, including "The Titan Games," "Manifest," "Songland," and "New Amsterdam," all of which were renewed for additional seasons. However, the network's dominance in the 2010s faded during the 2019-20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a disruption in production and leading to a move to the second position in the Nielsen ratings. NBC reclaimed its status as the top-rated network in 2022. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings for a single television season. Only two other shows had finished their runs at the top of the ratings, I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show. Consequently, Friends emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast. It dominated the ratings, never leaving the top five watched shows of the year from its second through tenth seasons and landing on the number-one spot during season eight in the 2001–02 season as the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings. Cheers spinoff Frasier became a critical and commercial success, usually landing in the Nielsen Top 20 – although its ratings were overshadowed to a minor extent by Friends – and went on to win numerous Emmy Awards (eventually setting a record for a sitcom that lasted until it was overtaken by Modern Family in 2014). In 1994, the network began branding its strong Thursday night lineup, mainly in reference to the comedies airing in the first two hours, under the "Must See TV" tagline (which during the mid- and late 1990s, was also applied to NBC's comedy blocks on other nights, particularly on Tuesdays).. Between September 1994 and September 1996, NBC would affiliate with several stations that were affected by the 1994–96 United States broadcast TV realignment, which was triggered as a result of Fox's acquisition of rights to the NFL in December 1993. Several of those stations, including WBAL-TV, WHDH (Boston), and WCAU (Philadelphia), were involved in an affiliation deal between Westinghouse Broadcasting and CBS, KSHB-TV (Kansas City), which is one of the stations involved in an affiliation deal between New World Communications and Fox, WCBD-TV (Charleston), which was involved in an affiliation deal between Allbritton Communications and ABC  and WGBA-TV (Green Bay), WPMI-TV (Mobile) and KHNL (Honolulu), which was part of an agreement between Fox and SF Broadcasting.By the mid-1990s, NBC's sports division, headed by Dick Ebersol, had rights to three of the four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, Major League Baseball and the NBA), the Olympics, and the national powerhouse Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. The NBA on NBC enjoyed great success in the 1990s due in large part to the Chicago Bulls' run of six championships at the hands of superstar Michael Jordan. However, NBC Sports would suffer a major blow in 1998, when it lost the rights to the American Football Conference (AFC) to CBS, which itself had lost rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) to Fox four years earlier; the deal stripped NBC of National Football League (NFL) game telecasts after 59 years and AFC games after 36 years (dating back to its existence as the American Football League prior to its 1970 merger with the NFL).. Littlefield left NBC in 1998 to pursue a career as a television and film producer, with the network subsequently going through three entertainment presidents in three years. Littlefield was replaced as president of NBC Entertainment by Scott Sassa, who oversaw the development of such shows as The West Wing, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Fear Factor. After Sassa was reassigned to NBC's West Coast Division, Garth Ancier was named as his replacement in 1999. Jeff Zucker then succeeded Ancier as president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. New century, new problems. At the start of the 2000s, NBC's fortunes started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and Just Shoot Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Between the 2001–02 and 2004–05 seasons, NBC became the first major network to air select dramas in letterbox over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost. In the 2011-12 season, NBC's broadcast of the Super Bowl and the success of The Voice, Smash, and Sunday Night Football helped the network break its eight-year streak in fourth place in the 18-49 demographic. However, the network's midseason ratings suffered in 2013, falling to fifth place during the February sweeps period. Despite this, NBC became the No. 1 network in the 18-49 demographic in the 2013-14 season for the first time since 2003-04, due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football, and new hits like The Blacklist and Hannibal. The network also saw improvement in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season. The 2015-16 season was successful for NBC with the launch of new dramas Blindspot and Chicago Med, and the continued success of The Blacklist and the Chicago franchise. The network also found success in the new comedy Superstore. The 2016-17 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of comedy-drama This Is Us and the continued growth of the Chicago franchise. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and Just Shoot Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Between the 2001–02 and 2004–05 seasons, NBC became the first major network to air select dramas in letterbox over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost. Overall, NBC retook its first-place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.. On the other hand, NBC was stripped of the broadcast rights to two other major sports leagues: it lost Major League Baseball to Fox after the 2000 season (by that point, NBC only had alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and World Series), and, later, the NBA to ABC after the 2001–02 season. After losing the NBA rights, NBC's major sports offerings were reduced to the Olympics (which in 2002, expanded to include rights to the Winter Olympics, as part of a contract that gave it the U.S. television rights to both the Summer and Winter Olympics through 2012), PGA Tour golf events and a floundering Notre Dame football program (however, it would eventually acquire the rights to the National Hockey League in May 2004).. In October 2001, NBC acquired Spanish-language network Telemundo from Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment for $2.7 billion, beating out other bidders including CBS/Viacom. The deal was finalized in 2002.In 2003, French entertainment conglomerate Vivendi Universal sold 80% of its film and television subsidiary, Vivendi Universal Entertainment, to NBC's parent company, General Electric, integrating the network with Vivendi Universal's various properties (Universal Pictures film studio, Canal+ television networks, & Universal Parks & Resorts theme & amusement parks & resorts) upon completion of the merger of the two companies under the combined NBC Universal brand. NBC Universal was then owned 80% by General Electric and 20% by Vivendi. In 2004, Zucker was promoted to the newly created position of president of NBC Universal Television Group. Kevin Reilly became the new president of NBC Entertainment.In 2004, NBC experienced a three on a match scenario—Friends and Frasier ended their runs; Jerry Orbach, who had played Lennie Briscoe in its hit Law & Order, died suddenly later that year)—and shortly afterward was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits. In particular, Friends spin-off Joey, despite a relatively strong start, started to falter in the ratings during its second season.. In December 2005, NBC began its first week-long primetime game show event, Deal or No Deal; the series garnered high ratings, and became a weekly series in March 2006. Otherwise, the 2005–06 season was one of the worst for NBC in three decades, with only one fall series, the sitcom My Name Is Earl, surviving for a second season; the sole remaining anchor of the "Must See TV" lineup, Will & Grace also saw its ratings decline. That season, NBC's ratings fell to fourth place, behind a resurgent ABC, Fox (which would eventually become the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the 2007–08 season), and top-rated CBS (which led for much of the remainder of the decade). During this time, all of the networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by cable television, home video, video games, and the Internet, with NBC being the hardest hit.. The 2006–07 season was a mixed bag for the network, with Deal or No Deal remaining strong and Heroes becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (from West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin) lost a third of its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually canceled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, The Office and 30 Rock, also pulled in modest successes and went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years.

Radio. Earliest stations: WEAF and WJZ. During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The creation of WEAF in 1922 offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of "chain" or "networking" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.. New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.. In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. Red and Blue Networks. RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shutting down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.. WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the "Red Network" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the "Blue Network" mostly carried sustaining – or non-sponsored – broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.. In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the "RCA Building" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures. Chimes. In the early 1920s, radio broadcasting began consolidating, with radio manufacturer RCA acquiring New York's WEAF from AT&T and transferring Westinghouse's WJZ to RCA. WEAF served as a lab for AT&T's Western Electric, which developed audio transmission technologies. WEAF was successful with a regular schedule of programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs. In 1923, RCA attempted to transmit audio between cities via telegraph lines, but it failed due to interference. AT&T sold WEAF and its embryonic network to RCA in 1925, allowing RCA to use AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. RCA, GE, and Westinghouse then created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1926, which was split into the Red and Blue Networks in 1927, focusing on commercially sponsored entertainment and non-sponsored broadcasts, respectively. NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks in 1927 and 1931, carrying Red and Blue Network programming. NBC moved to 711 Fifth Avenue in 1927 and then to the Rockefeller Center in 1933, where it became the lead tenant in the RCA Building. In the 1930s, NBC outgrew its facilities on Fifth Avenue and developed a shortwave radio network called the NBC White Network. General Electric, an early shareholder in NBC's parent company RCA, divested itself from RCA, leading to RCA becoming the lead tenant at the Rockefeller Center's RCA Building. The iconic NBC chimes were adopted in 1931, initially intended as a system cue for switching stations, and later used by the NBC television network and even licensed to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations. It was sold to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). After selling NBC's radio holdings to Westwood One in 1987, GE proceeded to sell off individual radio stations to various companies, including Emmis Communications, Westinghouse, and Susquehanna Radio Corporation, by 1989. NBC Radio News moved to Mutual's Arlington, Virginia, facility, with engineering operations and the affiliate relations department following suit. Further consolidation in 1992 led to joint production of newscasts during overnights and weekends, and both networks airing generic sportscasts. In 1994, Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting, which then acquired 25% of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity was subsequently acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1996, leading to CBS Radio Network falling under Westwood One management. The Mutual/NBC newsroom in Arlington closed in 1998, with CBS Radio News originating "NBC"-branded newscasts from New York. Westwood One launched NBC News Radio in 2003, which became a full-time operation in 2012 after acquiring Dial Global. NBC Sports Radio was launched in 2014 as a Dial Global/NBC Sports joint venture but ended 24/7 programming in 2018 and was shut down in 2020. Cumulus Media acquired Dial Global in 2013, reverting to the Westwood One name and merging it into Cumulus Media Networks. NBC News Radio ended operations in December 2014 after Cumulus announced a content-sharing deal with CNN as part of the pending launch of Westwood One News. Since 2016, iHeartMedia has produced "NBC News Radio"-branded newscasts via a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal. Television.

In the context of NBC's history, the network was once closely associated with David Sarnoff, who used it as a platform to sell consumer electronics. NBC and RCA introduced all-electronic television to the public at the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt appearing on television for the first time. NBC began transmitting network programs in 1

After a series of limited, incompatible color broadcasts (mostly scheduled during the day), CBS abandoned the system and broadcasts. This opened the door for the RCA-compatible color system to be adopted as the U.S. standard. RCA convinced the FCC to approve its color system in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming within days of the commission's decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, The Marriage.. In 1955, NBC broadcast a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's beloved play, on the Producers' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.. In 1956, NBC started a subsidiary, California National Productions (CNP), for merchandising, syndication and NBC opera company operations with the production of Silent Services. By 1957, NBC planned to remove the opera company from CNP and CNP was in discussion with MGM Television about handling syndication distribution for MGM series.During a National Association of Broadcasters meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program The Bell Telephone Hour, which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.. In 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color. Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as Walt Disney Presents) on ABC; however, ABC president Leonard Goldenson said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.. By 1963, much of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of I Dream of Jeannie and Convoy), and began billing itself as "The Full Color Network." Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the 1966–67 season. Days of Our Lives became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.. NBC contracted with Universal Studios in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, See How They Run, which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, The Hanged Man, aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.In 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. After CBS abandoned its incompatible color broadcast system in the early 1950s, NBC quickly adopted the RCA-compatible color system and began broadcasting color programs. NBC started with a few shows in 1954, including "The Marriage," and aired the first live color production of "Peter Pan" in 1955. NBC's success with color programming led to the establishment of a subsidiary, California National Productions, for merchandising and syndication operations. By 1963, most of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, and the network began branding itself as "The Full Color Network." NBC's commitment to color broadcasting led to the acquisition of the broadcast rights to the classic film "The Wizard of Oz" in 1967, which had previously been a staple of CBS's color broadcasts. After the U.S. entered World War II, commercial programming on NBC was limited and telecasts were reduced. However, NBC started regularly transmitting a few programs to affiliated stations in Philadelphia and Schenectady from 1944, with "The Voice of Firestone Televues" being the first regularly scheduled show. "The War As It Happens," initially a local program, was also transmitted to multiple cities on the NBC Television Network in April 1944. On V-E Day in 1945, WNBT broadcast extensive news coverage and remotes from New York City, promoting the event in advance.

Post-war, NBC's television network expanded from four stations, with the 1947 World Series boosting local television sales. By the early 1950s, NBC had achieved success in television, launching shows like Today, The Tonight Show, and Wide Wide World. NBC commissioned Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera for television, "Amahl and the Night Visitors," which was a major hit.

Although CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the U.S., their system was incompatible with black and white sets, leading to its abandonment. NBC, ready with color programming, began the transition to the RCA-compatible color system within days of its approval by the FCC in December 1953. NBC's first program to air all episodes in color, "The Marriage," began in the summer of 1954, and a live color production of "Peter Pan" was broadcast in 1955. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.In 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.. The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS, and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society. 1970s doldrums. The 1970s started strongly for NBC thanks to hits like Adam-12, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Ironside, The Dean Martin Show, and The Flip Wilson Show. However, despite the success of such new shows as the NBC Mystery Movie, Sanford and Son, Chico and the Man, Little House on the Prairie, The Midnight Special, The Rockford Files, Police Woman, and Emergency!, as well as continued success from veterans like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Wonderful World of Disney, the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade. Disney, in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put 60 Minutes up against the program in the Sunday 7:00 p.m. time slot in the 1975–76 season.. In 1974, under new president Herbert Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, miniseries and specials. This failed to attract the desirable 18–34 demographic, and simultaneously alienated older viewers. None of the new prime-time shows that NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal, all failing in the face of established competition. The network's lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show, NBC's Saturday Night – which would be renamed Saturday Night Live in 1976, after the cancellation of a Howard Cosell-hosted program of the same title on ABC – which replaced reruns of The Tonight Show that previously aired in its Saturday time slot.. In 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice president at RCA, and a desperate NBC lured Fred Silverman away from top-rated ABC to turn its fortunes around. With the notable exceptions of CHiPs, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Diff'rent Strokes (and its spin-off The Facts of Life), Real People, and the miniseries Shōgun, Silverman was unable to pull out a hit. Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch (such as Hello, Larry, Supertrain, Pink Lady and Jeff, The Krofft Superstar Hour, season six of Saturday Night Live, and The Waverly Wonders).

NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff.

Chimes. The iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as "the fourth chime", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations staffed by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G'-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference General Electric (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose radio station in Schenectady, New York, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network. As an example, it is incorporated into the theme music used by NBC News. In the late 1930s, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached an agreement with NBC for B&O to be allowed to NBC's tones to summon the railroad's passengers to dinner on its trains. New beginnings: The Blue Network becomes ABC. In 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency's creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.. After Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either "Blue" or "Blue Network", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply "NBC". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. In the 1930s, NBC outgrew its facilities on Fifth Avenue and developed a shortwave radio network called the NBC White Network. General Electric, an early shareholder in NBC's parent company RCA, divested itself from RCA, leading to RCA becoming the lead tenant at the Rockefeller Center's RCA Building. The iconic NBC chimes were adopted in 1931, initially intended as a system cue for switching stations, and later used by the NBC television network and even licensed to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations. It was sold to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). After being formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red becoming NBC Red Network, Inc., both networks separated their operations in 1942. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). NBC, on the other hand, became home to many popular performers and programs during the golden age of radio. However, in the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies, leading to many NBC performers, including Jack Benny, jumping to CBS. NBC stars also began migrating to television, causing a decline in NBC's radio programming. In response, NBC launched The Big Show in 1950, but it only lasted two years due to declining radio audiences. NBC's last major radio programming push was Monitor, which began on June 12, 1955. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either "Blue" or "Blue Network", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply "NBC". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the "American Broadcasting Company" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed. Defining radio's golden age. NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included Vic and Sade, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve, One Man's Family, Ma Perkins and Death Valley Days. NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique clear-channel national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.. In the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers – including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra – jumped to CBS.. In addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theater on the network became television's first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of simulcasting. Two of the concerts were historic firsts – the first complete telecast of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and the first complete telecast of Verdi's Aida (starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.. Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, The Big Show's initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell advertising time during the middle half-hour of the program each week).. NBC's last major radio programming push, beginning on June 12, 1955, was Monitor, a creation of NBC President Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, who also created the innovative programs Today, The Tonight Show and Home for the companion television network.

The representation of light in painting varies depending on the genre and technique used. In interior paintings, light creates intimate environments with contrasts of light and shadow, while in still life, artists can manipulate light at will for dramatic effects. Exterior paintings, such as landscapes, seascapes, and skyscapes, are enveloped in a luminous atmosphere that changes based on the time of day, weather, and environmental conditions. Artists often paint en plein air to capture their impressions directly. The human figure in painting is affected by light, which influences volume, generates different limits, and alters skin color. In abstract painting, light is used in a subjective way to convey concepts or sensations of the artist. During the Renaissance, there was a shift towards naturalistic representation of reality, including the study of light. This was evident in the use of linear perspective, chiaroscuro, and gradation to indicate depth, volume, and lighting effects. The oil painting technique became popular, providing greater chromatic richness and facilitating the representation of light. Renaissance light, often intense in the foreground and diminishing towards the background, was used as a tool to measure and order reality, shaping a plastic space through naturalistic representation. The first theoretical treatises on the representation of light in painting also emerged during this period. These artists and theorists emphasized the interdependence of light and color, and the use of light and shadow to create relief in painting. The representation of light in painting, including the human body and inanimate objects, is crucial for creating visual images on canvas. In abstract painting, light is used subjectively to convey concepts or sensations. The chronological factor is also significant in painting, with light playing a role in depicting specific times of day, which became more precise with advancements in artificial lighting. The first light of the day, dawn, was initially used sparingly but gained popularity in the 17th century, often creating a spherical effect. The text discusses various ways to harmonize colors in painting, including using warm and cool thermal ranges, complementary colors, and broken ranges. Warm colors include red, orange, purple, yellowish green, and black, while cool colors consist of blue, green, violet, and white. Complementary colors create the greatest chromatic contrast, and broken ranges involve neutralizing primary colors with their complementary colors to produce intense luminous effects.

The text also explains how the quality and appearance of light representation in a painting depend on the technique used. Different techniques and materials produce different light effects. For example, in drawing, light effects are achieved through black-white duality, while in oil painting, colors are dissolved in an oily binder, producing vivid colors and intense brightness. Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil and a binder, while watercolor uses transparent pigments diluted in water. Acrylic paint uses a plastic binder, which produces fast drying and flat colors.

Finally, the text mentions that light has different considerations depending on the pictorial genre. In interiors, light tends to create intimate environments with contrasts of light and shadow, while in exteriors, light has different incidences on objects and people. In still life paintings, artists can manipulate light at will, often with dramatic effects.

In Christianity, light is a significant symbol that represents various concepts such as divine omnipresence, truth, virtue, salvation, eternity, and heavenly world. It is also associated with Jesus and Mary, representing the Sun and Dawn, respectively. In Orthodox Christianity, light is considered not just a symbol but a "real aspect of divinity." The symbolism of light is used in various forms, including stained glass, halos of saints, and rays of light in paintings to depict divine grace, miracles, or revelations. Over time, the symbolism of light evolved from transcendental or divine light to identifying it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness, or rebirth, and opposing it to ignorance, evil, and death. In the 19th century, German Romantics related light to nature in a pantheistic sense, while in the 20th century, a more scientific view of light prevailed. According to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, Raphael "has given enchanting, loving and sweet light, so that his figures appear beautiful, pleasing and intricate in their contours, and endowed with such relief that they seem to move." Some of his lighting solutions were quite innovative, with resources halfway between Leonardo and Caravaggio, as seen in The Transfiguration (1517-1520, Vatican Museums, Vatican City), in which he divides the image into two halves, the heavenly and the earthly, each with different pictorial resources. In the Liberation of Saint Peter (1514, Vatican Museums, Vatican City) he painted a nocturnal scene in which the light radiating from the angel in the center stands out, giving a sensation of depth, while at the same time it is reflected in the breastplates of the guards, creating intense luminous effects. This was perhaps the first work to include artificial lighting with a naturalistic sense: the light radiating from the angel influences the illumination of the surrounding objects, while diluting the distant forms.. Outside Italy, Albrecht Dürer was especially concerned with light in his watercolor landscapes, treated with an almost topographical detail, in which he shows a special delicacy in the capture of light, with poetic effects that prelude the sentimental landscape of Romanticism. Albrecht Altdorfer showed a surprising use of light in The Battle of Alexander at Issos (1529, Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the appearance of the sun among the clouds produces a supernatural refulgence, effects of bubbling lights that also precede Romanticism. Matthias Grünewald was a solitary and melancholic artist, whose original work reflects a certain mysticism in the treatment of religious themes, with an emotive and expressionist style, still with medieval roots. His main work was the altar of Isenheim (1512-1516, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar), in which the refulgent halo in which he places his Risen Christ stands out. Between Gothic and Renaissance is the unclassifiable work of Bosch, a Flemish artist gifted with a great imagination, author of dreamlike images that continue to surprise for their fantasy and originality. In his works — and especially in his landscape backgrounds — there is a great skill in the use of light in different temporal and environmental circumstances, but he also knew how to recreate in his infernal scenes fantastic effects of flames and fires, as well as supernatural lights and other original effects, especially in works such as The Last Judgment (c. 1486-1510, Groenige Museum, Bruges), Visions of the Beyond (c. 1490, Doge's Palace, Venice), The Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1500-1505, Museo del Prado, Madrid), The Hay Chariot (c. 1500-1502, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or The Temptations of Saint Anthony (c. 1501, Museum of Fine Arts, Lisbon). Bosch had a predilection for the effects of light generated by fire, by the glow of flames, which gave rise to a new series of paintings in which the effects of violent and fantastic lights originated by fire stood out, as is denoted in a work by an anonymous artist linked to the workshop of Lucas van Leyden, Lot and his daughters (c. 1530, Musée du Louvre, Paris), or in some works by Joachim Patinir, such as Charon crossing the Styx Lagoon (c. 1520-1524, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or Landscape with the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (c. 1520, Boymans Van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam). These effects also influenced Giorgione, as well as some Mannerist painters such as Lorenzo Lotto, Dosso Dossi and Domenico Beccafumi. Mannerism. At the end of the High Renaissance, in the middle of the 16th century, Mannerism followed, a movement that abandoned nature as a source of inspiration to seek a more emotional and expressive tone, in which the artist's subjective interpretation of the work of art became more important, with a taste for sinuous and stylized form, with deformation of reality, distorted perspectives and gimmicky atmospheres. In this style light was used in a gimmicky way, with an unreal treatment, looking for a colored light of different origins, both a cold moonlight and a warm firelight. Mannerism broke with the full Renaissance light by introducing night scenes with intense chromatic interplay between light and shadow and a dynamic rhythm far from Renaissance harmony. In Byzantine and Romanesque art, there was a focus on the aesthetic value of light, particularly in the form of shines and reflections from gold and precious stones, which were seen as a representation of divine light. This was also true of Gothic art, where light played a strong symbolic role and was often associated with divinity and beauty. The use of stained glass in Gothic architecture, for example, created dynamic plays of light and color within the space of the buildings. In medieval miniatures, light was also important, with bright and brilliant colors used to create luminous images without the need for shading or chiaroscuro. However, in painting, light was not as prominent and did not have a direct connection to reality. The aesthetics of light in medieval art was influenced by scholarly philosophy and scientific advances in optics and the physics of light. In contrast to the "proper light" of medieval art, the "illuminating light" of modern and contemporary art is characterized by a focus on light as a means of illuminating and revealing the subject. This symbolism of light passing through glass is the same concept that was applied to Gothic stained glass, where light symbolizes divine omnipresence. Another symbolism related to light is that which identifies Jesus with the Sun and Mary as the Dawn that precedes him. In addition to all this, in Christianity light can also signify truth, virtue and salvation. In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be "plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called "illumination".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a "real aspect of divinity," according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires.. In Christian iconography, light is also present in the halos of the saints, which used to be made —especially in medieval art — with a golden nimbus, a circle of light placed around the heads of saints, angels and members of the Holy Family. In Fra Angelico's The Annunciation, in addition to the halo, the artist placed rays of light radiating from the figure of the archangel Gabriel, to emphasize his divinity, the same resource he uses with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. On other occasions, it is God himself who is represented in the form of rays of sunlight, as in The Baptism of Christ (1445) by Piero della Francesca. The rays can also signify God's wrath, as in The Tempest (1505) by Giorgione. On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Grünewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects — generally made with gold leaf — was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death. Descartes spoke of an "inner light" capable of capturing the "eternal truths", a concept also taken up by Leibniz, who distinguished between lumière naturelle (natural light) and lumière révélée (revealed light).In the 19th century light was related by the German Romantics (Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) to nature, in a pantheistic sense of communion with nature. For Schelling, light was a medium in which the "universal soul" (Weltseele) moved. For Hegel, light was the "ideality of matter", the foundation of the material world.Between the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed.

Vermeer, known as the "painter of light," specialized in depicting calm and tranquil interior scenes with a pale luminosity. He used pointillé to enhance objects and create a unique reflection of light on their surfaces. Vermeer's light is natural, with a yellowish tone, and forms the figures and objects in his works. Shadows are integrated into the luminous space, and the painting serves as an organized structure for the circulation and diffusion of light.

In contrast, Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens had different approaches to light. Hals had a Caravaggist phase with a bright and diffuse luminosity, while Jordaens had a style characterized by bright and fantastic coloring with strong contrasts of light and shadow. Between 1625 and 1630, Jordaens deepened the luminous values of his images.

Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou, used artificial candlelight in his works, influenced by Rembrandt.

Landscape painting was a prominent genre in Holland during this century, with artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde specializing in capturing atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. His work was channeled in the tenebrist naturalism, assuming its most characteristic features: expressive use of light and chiaroscuro, dramatism of the scenes and figures of round anatomy. His most famous work is Judith beheading Holofernes (two versions: 1612-1613, Museo Capodimonte, Naples; and 1620, Uffizi, Florence), where the light focuses on Judith, her maid and the Assyrian general, against a complete darkness, emphasizing the drama of the scene. In the 1630s, established in Naples, his style adopted a more classicist component, without completely abandoning naturalism, with more diaphanous spaces and clearer and sharper atmospheres, although chiaroscuro remained an essential part of the composition, as a means to create space, give volume and expressiveness to the image. One of his best compositions due to the complexity of its lighting is The Birth of Saint John the Baptist (1630, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where he mixes natural and artificial light: the light from the portal in the upper right part of the painting softens the light inside the room, in a "subtle transition of light values" — according to Roberto Longhi — that would later become common in Dutch painting. Adam Elsheimer was noted for his light studies of landscape painting, with an interest in dawn and dusk lights, as well as night lighting and atmospheric effects such as mists and fogs. His light was strange and intense, with an enamel-like appearance typical of German painting, in a tradition ranging from Lukas Moser to Albrecht Altdorfer. His most famous painting is Flight into Egypt (1609, Alte Pinakothek, Munich), a night scene that is considered the first moonlit landscape; four sources of light are visible in this work: the shepherds' bonfire, the torch carried by Saint Joseph, the moon and its reflection in the water; the Milky Way can also be perceived, whose representation can also be considered as the first one done in a naturalistic way.. Georges de La Tour was a magnificent interpreter of artificial light, generally lamp or candle lights, with a visible and precise focus, which he used to place inside the image, emphasizing its dramatic aspect. Sometimes, in order not to dazzle, the characters placed their hands in front of the candle, creating translucent effects on the skin, which acquired a reddish tone, of great realism and that proved his virtuosity in capturing reality. While his early works show the influence of Italian Caravaggism, from his stay in Paris between 1636 and 1643 he came closer to Dutch Caravaggism, more prone to the direct inclusion of the light source on the canvas. He thus began his most tenebrist period, with scenes of strong half-light where the light, generally from a candle, illuminates with greater or lesser intensity certain areas of the painting. In general, two types of composition can be distinguished: the fully visible light source (Job with his wife, Musée Départemental des Vosges, Épinal; Woman spurring herself, Musée Historique Lorrain, Nancy; Madeleine Terff, Musée du Louvre, Paris) or the light blocked by an object or character, creating a backlit illumination (Madeleine Fabius, Fabius collection, Paris; Angel appearing to Saint Joseph, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nantes; The Adoration of the Shepherds, Musée du Louvre, Paris). In his later works he reduces the characters to schematic figures of geometric appearance, like mannequins, to fully recreate the effects of light on masses and surfaces (The Repentance of Saint Peter, Museum of Art, Cleveland; The Newborn, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rennes; Saint Sebastian cured by Saint Irene, parish church of Broglie).. Despite its plausible appearance, La Tour's lighting is not fully naturalistic, but is sifted by the artist's will; at all times he prints the desired amount of light and shadow to recreate the desired effect; in general, it is a serene and diffuse lighting, which brings out the volume without excessive drama. The light serves to unite the figures, to highlight the part of the painting that best suits the plot of the work, it is a timeless light of a poetic, transcendent character; it is just the right light necessary to provide credibility, but it serves a more symbolic than realistic purpose. During the Renaissance, particularly in Italy, there was a shift towards a more naturalistic representation of reality, which included the study of light in pictorial composition. Giotto's frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel featured a distinction between flat and curved surfaces through the use of gradients and the orientation of surfaces was indicated by varying tones. Giotto was also the first to represent sunlight in his work. Taddeo Gaddi depicted divine light in a night scene through contrasts of yellow and violet. In the Netherlands, artists such as the van Eyck brothers and Robert Campin focused on capturing various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen. Hubert van Eyck, in particular, developed a sense of saturation of light and created realistic landscapes with subtle light effects. Jan van Eyck captured an atmospheric luminosity in his works and developed the oil painting technique, which gave greater luminosity and depth to the painting. Other Dutch artists, such as Dirk Bouts, Petrus Christus, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, also excelled in the expression of light in their works. The use of canvas and oil painting became widespread during the Renaissance, providing greater chromatic richness and facilitating the representation of light effects. Renaissance light was often intense in the foreground and diminished towards the background. Vermeer imprinted his works — generally everyday scenes in interior spaces — with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres. He used a technique called pointillé, a series of dots of pigment with which he enhanced the objects, on which he often applied a luminosity that made the surfaces reflect the light in a special way. Vermeer's light softens the contours without losing the solidity of the forms, in a combination of softness and precision that few other artists have achieved.. Nicknamed the "painter of light", Vermeer masterfully synthesized light and color, he knew how to capture the color of light like no one else. In his works, light is itself a color, while shadow is inextricably linked to light. Vermeer's light is always natural, he does not like artificial light, and generally has a tone close to lemon yellow, which together with the dull blue and light gray were the main colors of his palette. It is the light that forms the figures and objects, and in conjunction with the color is what fixes the forms. As for the shadows, they are interspersed in the light, reversing the contrast: instead of fitting the luminous part of the painting into the shadows, it is the shadows that are cut out of the luminous space. Contrary to the practice of chiaroscuro, in which the form is progressively lost in the half-light, Vermeer placed a foreground of dark color to increase the tonal intensity, which reaches its zenith in the middle light; from here he dissolves the color towards white, instead of towards black as was done in chiaroscuro. In Vermeer's work, the painting is an organized structure through which light circulates, is absorbed and diffused by the objects that appear on the scene. He builds the forms thanks to the harmony between light and color, which is saturated, with a predominance of pure colors and cold tones. The light gives visual existence to the space, which in turn receives and diffuses it.. In Vermeer, light is never artificial: it is precise and normal like that of nature, and of an accuracy capable of satisfying the most scrupulous physicist. [...] This accuracy of light in Vermeer is due to the harmony of the coloring.. Other prominent Dutch painters were Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens. The former had a Caravaggist phase between 1625 and 1630, with a clear chromaticism and diffuse luminosity (The Merry Drinker, 1627-1628, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Malle Babbe, 1629-1630, Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), to evolve later to a more sober, dark and monochromatic style. Jordaens had a style characterized by a bright and fantastic coloring, with strong contrasts of light and shadow and a technique of dense impasto. Between 1625 and 1630 he had a period in which he deepened the luminous values of his images, in works such as The Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia (1628, Church of Saint Augustine, Antwerp) or The Fecundity of the Earth (1630, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). One should also mention Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou who worked not only in his native country but also in England and Germany. An excellent portraitist, in many of his works he used artificial candlelight or candle light, influenced by Rembrandt, as in Portrait of William III (1692-1697, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), Portrait of James Stuart, Duke of Lennox and Richmond (1692-1696, Leiden Collection, New York), Young Man and Woman Studying a Statue of Venus by Lamplight (c. 1690, Leiden Collection, New York) or Old Man Reading by Candlelight (c. 1700, Museo del Prado, Madrid).. A genre that flourished in Holland in an exceptional way in this century was landscape painting, which, in line with the mannerist landscape painting of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Joos de Momper, developed a new sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. Jan van Goyen was its first representative, followed by artists such as Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle and Adriaen van de Velde. Salomon van Ruysdael sought atmospheric capture, which he treated by tonalities, studying the light of different times of the day.

These effects have a strong dramatism, which emphasizes the scenes represented, generally of religious type, although they also abound in mythological scenes, still lifes or vanitas. One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and José de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Musée du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action.. Artemisia Gentileschi trained with her father, Orazio Gentileschi, coinciding with the years when Caravaggio lived in Rome, whose work she could appreciate in San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria del Popolo. His work was channeled in the tenebrist naturalism, assuming its most characteristic features: expressive use of light and chiaroscuro, dramatism of the scenes and figures of round anatomy. His most famous work is Judith beheading Holofernes (two versions: 1612-1613, Museo Capodimonte, Naples; and 1620, Uffizi, Florence), where the light focuses on Judith, her maid and the Assyrian general, against a complete darkness, emphasizing the drama of the scene. Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti ("Gerard of the Nights"). In works such as Christ before the High Priest (1617), Nativity (1622), The Prodigal Son (1623) or The Procuress (1625), he showed great mastery in the use of artificial light, generally from candles, with one or two light sources that illuminated the scene unevenly, highlighting the most significant parts of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness. Of his Christ on the Column, Joachim von Sandrart said: "the brightness of the candles and lights illuminates everything with a naturalness that resembles life so closely that no art has ever reached such heights".. One of the greatest exponents of the symbolic use of light was Rembrandt, an original artist with a strong personal stamp, with a style close to tenebrism but more diffused, without the marked contrasts between light and shadow typical of the Caravaggists, but a more subtle and diffuse penumbra. According to Giovanni Arpino, Rembrandt "invented light, not as heat, but as value. He invented light not to illuminate, but to make his world unapproachable". In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light. Rembrandtian light is a reflection of an external force, which affects the objects causing them to radiate energy, like the retransmission of a message. Although he starts from tenebrism, his contrasts of light and shadow are not as sharp as those of Caravaggio, but he likes more a kind of golden shadows that give a mysterious air to his paintings. In Rembrandt, light was something structural, integrated in form, color and space, in such a way that it dematerializes bodies and plays with the texture of objects. It is a light that is not subject to the laws of physics, which he generally concentrates in one area of the painting, creating a glowing luminosity. In his work, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light. According to Wolfgang Schöne, in Rembrandt light and darkness are actually two types of light, one bright and the other dark. He used to use a canvas as a reflecting or diffusing screen, which he regulated as he wished to obtain the desired illumination in each scene. His concern for light led him not only to his pictorial study, but also to establish the correct placement of his paintings for optimal visualization; thus, in 1639 he advised Constantijn Huygens on the placement of his painting Samson blinded by the Philistines: "hang this painting where there is strong light, so that it can be seen from a certain distance, and thus it will have the best effect". Rembrandt also masterfully captured light in his etchings, such as The Hundred Florins and The Three Crosses, in which light is almost the protagonist of the scene.. Rembrandt picked up the luminous tradition of the Venetian school, as did his compatriot Johannes Vermeer, although while the former stands out for his fantastic effects of light, the latter develops in his work a luminosity of great quality in the local tones. Vermeer imprinted his works — generally everyday scenes in interior spaces — with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres. He used a technique called pointillé, a series of dots of pigment with which he enhanced the objects, on which he often applied a luminosity that made the surfaces reflect the light in a special way. Vermeer's light softens the contours without losing the solidity of the forms, in a combination of softness and precision that few other artists have achieved.. Nicknamed the "painter of light", Vermeer masterfully synthesized light and color, he knew how to capture the color of light like no one else. In his works, light is itself a color, while shadow is inextricably linked to light. The Caravaggist School of Utrecht, including Terbrugghen, Van Baburen, and Honthorst, trained in Rome and adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects. They developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and compositional schemes. Rembrandt, a symbolic master of light, used a more diffused tenebrism with subtle contrasts and divine connotations. His light is structural, integrated with form, color, and space, and he concentrates it in specific areas to create glowing luminosity. Vermeer, the "painter of light," mastered the synthesis of light and color, capturing the color of light and using it as a protagonist in his works. His light creates calm and placid atmospheres in interior scenes. In his later works he reduces the characters to schematic figures of geometric appearance, like mannequins, to fully recreate the effects of light on masses and surfaces (The Repentance of Saint Peter, Museum of Art, Cleveland; The Newborn, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rennes; Saint Sebastian cured by Saint Irene, parish church of Broglie).. Despite its plausible appearance, La Tour's lighting is not fully naturalistic, but is sifted by the artist's will; at all times he prints the desired amount of light and shadow to recreate the desired effect; in general, it is a serene and diffuse lighting, which brings out the volume without excessive drama. The light serves to unite the figures, to highlight the part of the painting that best suits the plot of the work, it is a timeless light of a poetic, transcendent character; it is just the right light necessary to provide credibility, but it serves a more symbolic than realistic purpose. It is an unreal light, since no candle generates such a serene and diffuse light, a conceptual and stylistic light, which serves only the compositional intention of the painter.Another French Caravaggist was Trophime Bigot, nicknamed Maître à la chandelle (Master of the candle) for his scenes of artificial light, in which he showed great expertise in the technique of chiaroscuro. The Valencian artist José de Ribera (nicknamed lo Spagnoletto), who lived in Naples, fully assumed the Caravaggesque light, with an anti-idealist style of pasty brushstrokes and dynamic effects of movement. Ribera assumed the tenebrist illumination in a personal way, sifted by other influences, such as Venetian coloring or the compositional rigor of Bolognese classicism. In his early work he used the violent contrasts of light and shadow characteristic of tenebrism, but from the 1630s he evolved to a greater chromaticism and clearer and more diaphanous backgrounds. In contrast to the flat painting of Caravaggio, Ribera used a dense paste that gave more volume and emphasized the brightness. One of his best works, Sileno ebrio (1626, Museum of Capodimonte, Naples) stands out for the flashes of light that illuminate the various characters, with special emphasis on the naked body of the Sileno, illuminated by a flat light of morbid appearance.. In addition to Ribera, in Spain, Caravaggism had the figure of Juan Bautista Maíno, a Dominican friar who was drawing teacher of Philip IV, resident in Rome between 1598 and 1612, where he was a disciple of Annibale Carracci; his work stands out for its colorism and luminosity, as in The Adoration of the Shepherds (1611-1613, Museo del Prado, Madrid). Also noteworthy is the work of the still life painters Juan Sánchez Cotán and Juan van der Hamen. In general, Spanish naturalism treated light with a sense close to Caravaggism, but with a certain sensuality coming from the Venetian school and a detailing with Flemish roots. Francisco de Zurbarán developed a somewhat sweetened tenebrism, although one of his best works, San Hugo in the refectory of the Carthusian monks (c. 1630, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) stands out for the presence of white color, with a subtle play of light and shadow that stands out for the multiplicity of intensities applied to each figure and object.In Venice, Baroque painting did not produce such exceptional figures as in the Renaissance and Mannerism, but in the work of artists such as Domenico Fetti, Johann Liss, and Bernardo Strozzi one can perceive the vibrant luminism and the enveloping atmospheres so characteristic of Venetian painting.. The Caravaggist novelties had a special echo in Holland, where the so-called Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged, a series of painters who assumed the description of reality and the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio as pictorial principles, on which they developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and the search for new compositional schemes, resulting in a painting that stands out for its optical values. Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours.

It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving "an elevated style of landscape" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting. He also painted biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component, as in his Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time. An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one. Church was Cole's first disciple, who transmitted to him his vision of a majestic and exuberant nature, which he reflected in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner, whose atmospheric effects are seen in works such as In the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D. C.), a lake between mountains seen after a storm, with the sun's rays breaking through the clouds. Heade was devoted to country landscapes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, in meadows of endless horizons with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day, sometimes refracted by humid atmospheres. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism. Handicapped since childhood by polio, he focused on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon, in which light has a special role, a placid light that gives a sense of eternity, of time stopped in a serene perfection and harmony. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style. Bingham masterfully captured in his scenes of the Far West the limpid and clear light of dawn, his favorite when recreating scenes with American Indians and pioneers of the conquest of the West.. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, who excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, deserves special mention. One of his favorite genres was the seascape, in which he displayed a great interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day. His painting Moonlight. Wood Island Lighthouse (1894, Museum of Modern Art, New York) was painted entirely by moonlight, in five hours of work. Another important school was Belgian Luminism. In Belgium, the influence of French Impressionism was strongly felt, initially in the work of the group called Les Vingt, as well as in the School of Tervueren, a group of landscape painters who already showed their interest in light, especially in the atmospheric effects, as can be seen in the work of Isidore Verheyden. Later, Pointillism was the main influence on Belgian artists of the time, a trend embraced by Émile Claus and Théo van Rysselberghe, the main representatives of Belgian Luminism. Claus adopted Impressionist techniques, although he maintained academic drawing as the basis for his compositions, and in his work — mainly landscapes — he showed great interest in the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions, with a style that sometimes recalls Monet. Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as by the Baroque painter Frans Hals and Spanish painting. His technique was of loose and vigorous brushwork, with great luminous contrasts.A luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, more closely linked to the incipient Fauvism, in which Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, Jan Sluyters, and the early work of Piet Mondrian stood out. Korovin painted both urban landscapes — Parisian street scenes — and natural landscapes — summer images in Crimea — in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art. In Spain, the work of Aureliano de Beruete and Darío de Regoyos stands out. Beruete was a disciple of Carlos de Haes, so he was trained in the realist landscape, but assumed the impressionist technique after a period of training in France. An admirer of Velazquez's light, he knew how to apply it to the Castilian landscape — especially the mountains of Madrid — with his own personal style. Regoyos also trained with Haes and developed an intimate style halfway between pointillism and expressionism. Luminism and symbolism. From the mid-19th century until practically the transition to the 20th century, various styles emerged that placed special emphasis on the representation of light, which is why they were generically referred to as "luminism", with various national schools in the United States and various European countries or regions. The term luminism was introduced by John Ireland Howe Baur in 1954 to designate the landscape painting done in the United States between 1840 and 1880, which he defines as "a polished and meticulous realism in which there are no noticeable brushstrokes and no trace of impressionism, and in which atmospheric effects are achieved by infinitely careful gradations of tone, by the most exact study of the relative clarity of nearer and more distant objects, and by an accurate rendering of the variations of texture and color produced by direct or reflected rays".The first was American Luminism, which gave rise to a group of landscape painters generally grouped in the so-called Hudson River School, in which we can include to a greater or lesser extent Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Martin Johnson Heade, Fitz Henry Lane, John Frederick Kensett, James Augustus Suydam, Francis Augustus Silva, Jasper Francis Cropsey and George Caleb Bingham. In general, his works were based on bombastic compositions, with a horizon line of great depth and a sky of veiled aspect, with atmospheres of strong expressiveness. His light is serene and peaceful, reflecting a mood of love for nature, a nature largely in the United States of the time virgin and paradisiacal, yet to be explored. It is a transcendent light, of spiritual significance, whose radiance conveys a message of communion with nature. Although they use a classical structure and composition, the treatment of light is original because of the infinity of subtle variations in tonality, achieved through a meticulous study of the natural environment of their country. According to Barbara Novak, Luminism is a more serene form of the romantic aesthetic concept of the sublime, which had its translation in the deep expanses of the North American landscape.. Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting: in the former, the landscape — more centered in the New England area — is more peaceful, more anecdotal, with delicate tonal gradations characterized by a crystalline light that seems to emanate from the canvas, in neat brushstrokes that seem to recreate the surface of a mirror and in compositions in which the excess of detail is unreal due to its straightness and geometrism, resulting in an idealization of nature. Thus understood, Luminism would encompass Heade, Lane, Kensett, Suydam and Silva. Hudson River landscape painting, on the other hand, would have a more cosmic vision and a predilection for a wilder and more grandiloquent nature, with more dramatic visual effects, as seen in the work of Cole, Durand, Church, Bierstadt, Cropsey and Bingham. It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving "an elevated style of landscape" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting.

An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one. During the late 19th century, several artists from various countries, including the United States, explored the representation of light in their art. These artists, sometimes referred to as "luminists," emphasized light in their works, often using impressionist techniques. In the United States, Thomas Cole, considered the pioneer of the Hudson River School, aimed to create an elevated style of landscape with a moral message. Durand, known for his intimate and picturesque vision of nature, painted natural landscapes after turning away from engraving. Church, Cole's first disciple, reflected a majestic and exuberant nature in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner and captured atmospheric effects in his works. Heade was devoted to country landscapes with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism, focusing on the landscape of his native Gloucester with a placid light that gives a sense of eternity. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea.

Belgian and Dutch luminism also emerged during this time, with artists such as Émile Claus and Jan Toorop adopting impressionist techniques and focusing on the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions. In the 19th century, French artist Eugène Delacroix and English painters John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner were prominent figures in the art world. Delacroix, influenced by Rubens and the Venetian school, developed a proto-impressionist style, focusing on patches of light and color. Constable, known for capturing atmospheric phenomena, was credited with the invention of the "chiaroscuro of nature" and had a technique of interrupted strokes and touches of pure white. Turner, with his great intuition for light, created dramatic environments with a colored light that dissolved forms, making his works visually realistic. Richard Parkes Bonington, a British watercolorist and lithographer, and Caspar David Friedrich, a German painter with a pantheistic vision of nature, were also notable artists of the time.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, luminism developed in several countries, with artists capturing light in various ways. In Spain, Joaquín Sorolla mastered capturing the warm Mediterranean light, particularly in seascapes, and later adopted a more nuanced tonality and pointillist technique. The Sitges School in Catalonia, active from 1878 to 1892, preferred the vibrant Mediterranean light and atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast, creating harmonious compositions with subtle chromaticism and fluid brushstrokes. Symbolism, an artistic movement that emerged as a reaction to naturalism, used light symbolically to suggest spirituality or emotion, rather than as an objective representation of the material world. In the late 19th century, various artists explored the use of light, color, and brushwork in their art. In Italy, artists like Tranquillo Cremona, Mosè Bianchi, and Daniele Ranzoni used chromatic vibrations and blurred contours to depict their emotions, while Giovanni Segantini combined academic drawing with post-impressionist coloring and a focus on high-altitude light effects. In Germany, Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt explored impressionism with unique sensitivities to light, often influenced by their native regions. James Abbott McNeil Whistler in Great Britain created foggy, night scenes with artificial light effects, while John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam in the United States contributed with their distinct styles. Scandinavian impressionists, many trained in Paris, had a special sensitivity to light, often focusing on complex lighting effects and romantic themes. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin were known for their bright, vibrant chromatism and light reflections, while in Spain, Aureliano de Beruete and Darío de Regoyos adopted impressionist techniques in their Castilian and French landscapes. The Norwegian Johan Christian Dahl moved in the wake of Friedrich, although with a greater interest in light and atmospheric effects, which he captured in a naturalistic way, thus moving away from the romantic landscape. In his works he shows a special interest in the sky and clouds, as well as misty and moonlit landscapes. In many of his works the sky occupies almost the entire canvas, leaving only a narrow strip of land occupied by a solitary tree.Georg Friedrich Kersting made a transposition of Friedrich's pantheistic mysticism to interior scenes, illuminated by a soft light of lamps or candles that gently illuminate the domestic environments that he used to represent, giving these scenes an appearance that transcends reality to become solemn images with a certain mysterious air.. Philipp Otto Runge developed his own theory of color, according to which he differentiated between opaque and transparent colors according to whether they tended to light or darkness. In his work this distinction served to highlight the figures in the foreground from the background of the scene, which was usually translucent, generating a psychological effect of transition between planes. This served to intensify the allegorical sense of his works, since his main objective was to show the mystical character of nature. Runge was a virtuoso in capturing the subtle effects of light, a mysterious light that has its roots in Altdorfer and Grünewald, as in his portraits illuminated from below with magical reflections that illuminate the character as if immersed in a halo.. The Nazarene movement also emerged in Germany, a series of painters who between 1810 and 1830 adopted a style that was supposedly old-fashioned, inspired by Renaissance classicism — mainly Fra Angelico, Perugino and Raphael — and with an accentuated religious sense. The Nazarene style was eclectic, with a preponderance of drawing over color and a diaphanous luminosity, with limitation or even rejection of chiaroscuro. Its main representatives were: Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Franz Pforr. Also in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire there was the Biedermeier style, a more naturalistic tendency halfway between romanticism and realism. One of its main representatives was Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, an advocate of the study of nature as the only goal of painting. His paintings are brimming with a resplendent clarity, a meticulously elaborated light of almost palpable quality, as an element that builds the reality of the painting, combined with well-defined shadows. Other artists of interest in this trend are Johann Erdmann Hummel, Carl Blechen, Carl Spitzweg and Moritz von Schwind. Hummel used light as a stylizing element, with a special interest in unusual light phenomena, from artificial light to glints and reflections. Blechen evolved from a typical romanticism with a heroic and fantastic tone to a naturalism that was characterized by light after a year's stay in Italy. Blechen's light is summery, a bright light that accentuates the volume of objects by giving them a tactile substance, combined with a skillful use of color. Spitzweg incorporated camera obscura effects into his paintings, in which light, whether sunlight or moonlight, appears in the form of beams that create effects that are sometimes unreal but of great visual impact. Schwind was the creator of a diaphanous and lyrical light, captured in resplendent luminous spaces with subtle tonal gradations in the reflections. Lastly, we should mention the Danish Christen Købke, author of landscapes of a delicate light reminiscent of the Pointillé of Vermeer or the luminosity of Gerrit Berckheyde.. In Spain, it is worth mentioning Jenaro Pérez Villaamil, who became the first professor of landscape painting at the San Fernando Academy.  Influenced by English landscape painting — especially David Roberts — his work is characterized by his neat drawing, his graceful line and his freshness of stroke, in paintings and watercolors in which he portrays the Spanish landscape from a picturesque and archaeological perspective, with a certain component of nostalgia. In Italy in the 1830s the so-called Posillipo School, a group of anti-academic Neapolitan landscape painters, among whom Giacinto Gigante, Filippo Palizzi and Domenico Morelli stood out. These artists showed a new concern for light in the landscape, with a more truthful aspect, far from the classical canons, in which the shimmering effects gain prominence. Inspired by Vedutism and picturesque painting, as well as by the work of what they considered their direct master, Anton Sminck van Pitloo, they used to paint from life, in compositions in which the chromatism stands out without losing the solidity of the drawing. Realism. Artists like Tranquillo Cremona, Mosè Bianchi or Daniele Ranzoni tried to capture on canvas their feelings through chromatic vibrations and blurred contours, with characters and objects almost dematerialized. Giovanni Segantini, a personal artist who combined a drawing of academicist tradition with a post-impressionist coloring where the light effects have a great relief. Segantini's specialty was the mountain landscape, which he painted outdoors, with a technique of strong brushstrokes and simple colors, with a vibrant light that he only found in the high alpine mountains. In Germany, impressionism was represented by Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt. The first was more of a plenairist than strictly an impressionist, although more than landscape painting he devoted himself to genre painting, especially of religious themes, works in which he also showed a special sensitivity to light. Corinth had a rather eclectic career, from academic beginnings — he was a disciple of Bouguereau — through realism and impressionism, to a certain decadentism and an approach to Jugendstil, to finally end up in expressionism. Influenced by Rembrandt and Rubens, he painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes with a serene and brilliant chromatism. Slevogt assumed the fresh and brilliant chromatism of the Impressionists, although renouncing the fragmentation of colors that they made, and his technique was of loose brushstrokes and energetic movement, with bold and original light effects, which denote a certain influence of the baroque art of his native Bavaria.. In Great Britain, the work of James Abbott McNeil Whistler, American by birth but established in London since 1859, stood out. His landscapes are the antithesis of the sunny French landscapes, as they recreate the foggy and taciturn English climate, with a preference for night scenes, images from which he nevertheless knows how to distill an intense lyricism, with artificial light effects reflected in the waters of the Thames.In the United States, it is worth mentioning the work of John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam. Sargent was an admirer of Velázquez and Frans Hals, and excelled as a social portraitist, with a virtuoso and elegant technique, both in oil and watercolor, the latter mainly in landscapes of intense color. Cassatt lived for a long time in Paris, where he was related to the Impressionist circle, with whom he shared more the themes than the technique, and developed an intimate and sophisticated work, influenced by Japanese prints. Hassam's main motif was New York life, with a fresh but somewhat cloying style.. Mention should also be made of Scandinavian impressionism, many of whose artists were trained in Paris. These painters had a special sensitivity to light, perhaps due to its absence in their native land, so they traveled to France and Italy attracted by the "light of the south". The main exponents were Peder Severin Krøyer, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, and Anders Zorn. The former showed a special interest in highly complex lighting effects, such as the mixing of natural and artificial light. Gallen-Kallela was an original artist who later approached symbolism, with a personal expressive and stylized painting with a tendency towards romanticism, with a special interest in Finnish folklore. Zorn specialized in portraits, nudes and genre scenes, with a brilliant brushstroke of vibrant luminosity.. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin should be mentioned. Serov had a style similar to that of Manet or Renoir, with a taste for intense chromatism and light reflections, a bright light that extols the joy of life. Korovin painted both urban landscapes — Parisian street scenes — and natural landscapes — summer images in Crimea — in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art. In Spain, the work of Aureliano de Beruete and Darío de Regoyos stands out. Beruete was a disciple of Carlos de Haes, so he was trained in the realist landscape, but assumed the impressionist technique after a period of training in France. An admirer of Velazquez's light, he knew how to apply it to the Castilian landscape — especially the mountains of Madrid — with his own personal style. Regoyos also trained with Haes and developed an intimate style halfway between pointillism and expressionism. Luminism and symbolism.

In the early 20th century, Belgrade had a variety of popular kafanas and hotels, each with unique features and offerings. "Srpska kruna," known as the "people's university," was particularly notable and was replaced by "Park" restaurant after its demolition. However, "Park" later burned down in 2012. Other famous kafanas included "Babuna," "Bajlonijeva kafana," "Boem," "Bulevar," "Bums Keler," "Cvetkova mehana," and "Čukareva kafana," each with their own distinct characteristics and histories. In 1927, the Ministry of Finance banned nightlife after 23:00, imposing fines on those who stayed out past 11 PM. The text highlights the significance of these venues in Belgrade's social and cultural life, as well as the changes that occurred over time. After the economic collapse in the late 1980s, many traditional kafanas in Belgrade, such as "Atina," "Buffet of Hotel Bristol," "Grgeč," "Kasina," "Lion," "Mihajlovac," "Promaja," and "Tri lista duvana," have closed or been transformed. These kafanas were once gathering places for diverse groups, including journalists, writers, opera singers, actors, athletes, professional gamblers, and politicians. Some, like "Atina" and "Grgeč," were transformed into modern restaurants or stores, while others, like "Promaja," were forcefully demolished. This marked the end of an era in Belgrade's social life, as these kafanas were replaced by new commercial buildings or modern restaurants. By the 18th century, Belgrade had many kafanas and meyhanas, with a significant number in the German sector serving beer and the Serbian sector serving wine and rakia. Zemun, although historically separate, had its own establishments, including the White Bear Tavern. The term "kafana" comes from the Persian qahvah–khanah, meaning "coffee house." In the 19th century, kafanas became important social institutions in Belgrade, with various types offering different services and becoming gathering spots for different groups. They served as centers of political and cultural life, with some even turning into debate clubs for political parties. The codification of hospitality objects in 1847 and 1863 established rules for kafanas, including the prohibition of women ownership and work in certain types of kafanas. The White Bear Tavern in Zemun is considered the oldest surviving building in urban Belgrade, while the House at 10 Cara Dušana Street in Dorćol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade. After the economic collapse in the late 1980s, many traditional kafanas in Belgrade, including "Tri lista duvana," "Vidin kapija," "Zora," and "Žagubica," have closed or been transformed, marking the end of an era in Belgrade's social life. These kafanas were once gathering places for various groups and had cultural and historical significance. Some, like "Tri lista duvana," were famous and had a significant impact on the city's culture and history. They were replaced by new commercial buildings or modern restaurants. The kafanas were described as the first democratic space in the new society, open to everyone without the need for an invitation or membership.

Cultural and historical significance. Historian Dubravka Stojanović singles out kafanas from other institutions of the civil society (salons, clubs, associations), as the first institute of the new society, both in terms of chronology and importance. She described it as the first democratic space for which no "invitation" (literacy, membership card, party discipline) was needed. Due to the volatile history in the Balkans, various kafanas served as gathering places and recruitment centers for numerous wars and rebellions: "Crni Konj" (Zadarska Street; for individual fighters in the Serbian-Ottoman Wars), "Kragujevac" (Karađorđeva Street); Garibalidians, Italian volunteers in the Serbian-Turkish Wars of 1876–1878, "Zlatni Krst" (Serbian volunteers for the same conflict), etc.Kafanas were also important for the economy. First public places for drafting contracts and merchant treaties were kafanas. This is why they originally developed around the main merchant areas and old khans. They were socially important as they allowed for the poor classes to participate in economic activities, too. Most important in this sense were "Zisina kafana" (opened before 1826 in Savamala), "Kod Paje kantardžije" and nearby "?". Kafanas hosted numerous firsts in Belgrade: bank (First Serbian Bank, in "Staro Zdanje", went bankrupt in 1875), exchange office, labor market, stock exchange (in "Bosna", corner of Karađorđeva and Travnička, in 1895), insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio. Every guild had "its own" kafana.Kafana's importance in Belgrade's history is such that numerous historical or anecdotal events occurred in them:. 1834 - the first game of billiard in Belgrade was held in "?".. 1859 - the first assembly after the return of Prince Miloš Obrenović to the throne was held in "Velika Pivnica", so as many future parliamentary sessions.. 1867 - official celebration of the complete handing over of the city by the Ottomans to the Serbs was held at the "Kod Rajića junaka serbskog". 1876 - Russian colonel Nikolay Nikolayevich Raevsky the Younger signed application as a volunteer in the Serbian army against the Turks in the "Crni Konj". Raevsky was Tolstoy's inspiration for Count Aleksei Vronsky in Anna Karenina.. 1876 - Red Cross of Serbia founded in "Građanska kasina".. 1881 - the first telephone line installed in "Tri lista duvana".. 1881 - Serbian Journalists Association founded in "Građanska kasina".. 1882 - the first light bulb lit in "Hamburg".. 1894 - Belgrade Stock Exchange opened in "Kasina" (later moved to "Bosna"), which also hosted parliamentary sessions due to the unrepresentative building of the Serbian assembly. This continued after the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, until the new assembly building was finished in 1936. Also hosted performances of the National Theatre in Belgrade until 1920.. 1896 - first public motion picture show in Serbia held in "Zlatni krst", on Terazije, on 6 June 1896, with Lumière brothers personally showing the film. King Aleksandar Obrenović was in the audience. The tickets were pricey and the films were screened for the next six months. The Lumière brothers' camera remained in Belgrade and is kept at Yugoslav Film Archive.. 1896 - first intercity phone line established from "Kolarac" to the city of Niš. On the Belgrade side there was a concert of the vocal ensemble "Stanković", while on the Niš side it was a singers' society "Branko".. 1900s - travelling cinemas began to show movies in "Kasina", where the first permanent cinema was opened in 1910.. 1900s - "Kolarac" was a regular meeting place of young officers headed by Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, who here plotted the 1903 May Coup, which ended with the deaths of king Alexander and queen Draga, and termination of the Obrenović dynasty in 1903. After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to close or transform. These kafanas were the first democratic space in the new society and open to all without the need for an invitation or membership. They were also gathering places and recruitment centers for various wars and rebellions, and served as the first public places for drafting contracts and merchant treaties. Kafanas played a significant role in Belgrade's history, hosting numerous firsts such as the first bank, exchange office, labor market, stock exchange, insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio, and more. Numerous historical or anecdotal events occurred in these kafanas, such as the first game of billiard, assembly, official celebration, signing of applications, founding of associations, installation of the first telephone line, and more. Kafanas also served as regular meeting places for young officers who plotted coups and ended dynasties. Historian Dubravka Stojanović highlights the importance of kafanas as the first institute of the new society, both in terms of chronology and importance.

After World War II, kafanas in Belgrade, such as "Kolubara", "Sokolac", "Bled", "Golf", "Hotel Moskva", "Kalenić", "Klub Književnika", "Kolarac", and "Lipov lad", served as gathering places for various groups of people and had unique atmospheres. However, by the 2020s, the "spirit of Čubura" disappeared as kafanas closed one by one, including the famed "Čuburska lipa" in early 2018. Some kafanas were transformed into other facilities, while others were taken over by different entities. The oldest still operational kafana in Belgrade, "?" (Question Mark), has been in operation since 1823 and is known for its tradition of cooked meals. These kafanas were once the heart of the city's social life and were highly esteemed among the intellectual elite, attracting famous musicians, writers, and artists.

Kafana "Amerika" was known for Turkish delight, chickpeas and čočeks, but also for introducing belly dancers and was notorious for prostitution. Hotel and restaurant "Balkan" on Terazije was built in 1935 on the location of the former "Simina kafana" from 1860. Ranked as the highest category 1, it was a meeting place of the businesspeople, and was one of the few here women were allowed to work. "Zlatni krst", also in Terazije, advertised itself in 1862 as having "12 rooms and stable for 30 horses".A custom of unusual, exotic and funny names continued, often countering some neighboring or well established venue: "Pivni izvor" [Beer Spring], "Bosfor" [Bosporus] (next to "Dardaneli" [Dardanelles]), "Engleska kraljica" [Queen of England], "Zemljotres" [Earthquake], "Crna mačka" [Black Cat] (next to "Bela mačka" [White Cat]), "Žurka" [Party], "Kod tri seljaka" [Chez Three Peasants], "Astronomska kugla" [Astronomy Ball], "Kod bombardovanja Beograda" [Chez Bombing of Belgrade], "Gusarski brod" [Pirate Ship], "Dva panja" [Two Logs], "Jeftinoća" [Cheapness], "Musa Kesedžija", "Radosan Srbin" [Joyful Serb], "Srpski vlakovođa" [Serbian Train Driver], "Crni Arapin" [Black Arab], "U modrim šumama" [In Blue Forests], "Kod dve misterije" [Chez Two Mysteries], "Kod Oroza" [Chez Trigger], "Vrući gavran" [Hot Raven], "Izgubljeno jagnje" [Lost Lamb] or "Kod žirafu vanevropsku zverku" [Chez giraffe, out-of-Europe beast].One of the most distinguished venues was '"Srpska kruna", built in 1869 and adapted into the hotel. It originated in 1853 at the corner of Knez Mihailova and Pariska streets. It was famous for its balls. Built by prince Alexander Karađorđević, it was sold to the Belgrade administration which moved in. The new building, located across the Kalemegdan Park, today hosts the Belgrade City Library. It was part of the colloquially styled "Kalemegdan group of hotels", due to their location. The venues began to develop after 1867 and full withdrawal of the Ottomans from the city. The group included the "Nacional" inn, later also a hotel, built in 1868. "Srpska kruna" architecturally preserved the appearance of the khan - squared, central inner yard - but in modern style. It had only 12 rooms but was famous for its large ceremonial hall, used for the European-style balls and concerts, though every ball had to start with the Serbian folk kolo Srbijanka. "Dardaneli" became the most popular kafana after the 1896 reconstruction, a pivot for actors, writers, singing societies, and the central point of city's urban spirit and bohemianism. It was founded in 1855 by Arif Bey, the Turk. Ownership changed a lot, being owned by a Serbian woman Stojana in 1858, as she received it as a dowry. It had billiard tables. Notable regular guests included Vojislav Ilić, Branislav Nušić, Antun Gustav Matoš, Stevan Sremac, Radoje Domanović, Janko Veselinović, Toša Jovanović, Đura Jakšić, and Milovan Glišić. It was affectionately called "people's university". When it was to be closed, regular guests organized "farewell ceremony" - some 70 people gathered, wearing fedoras and top hats, organized by the famous Bohemian actor Čiča Ilija Stanojević, and performed a dignified farewell "with great sadness and sorrow". It was demolished in 1901, a modern National Museum in Belgrade was built instead, so the clientele moved to "Velika Srbija" and the already established kafana hub, Skadarlija. In the 19th century, kafanas in Belgrade continued to evolve and cater to different groups, with some becoming notorious for specific offerings or activities. For example, the "Amerika" kafana was known for Turkish delight, chickpeas, čočeks, belly dancers, and prostitution. Meanwhile, the "Balkan" hotel and restaurant, built in 1935, was a meeting place for businesspeople and one of the few places where women were allowed to work. Other kafanas had creative and distinctive names, such as "Beer Spring," "Bosporus," "Queen of England," and "Chez Three Peasants." The "Srpska kruna" kafana, built in 1869, was particularly distinguished and was famous for its balls. When it was closed in 1901, its clientele moved to other kafanas in the city. In the 19th century, kafanas in Belgrade evolved into various types, each catering to different groups such as craftsmen, farmers, and traders. Some kafanas even became debate clubs for political parties. The first hotel, "Kod jelena," was built in 1843 and introduced European entertainment traditions. Kafanas allowed patrons to stay the night, and the first electrified streetlamp in 1893 marked the beginning of "proper nightlife." The kafanas had creative names, some referencing nearby buildings or businesses. The "Amerika" kafana was notorious for prostitution, while the "Balkan" hotel was a meeting place for businesspeople and one of the few places where women could work. After World War II, many traditional kafanas in Belgrade, such as "Kolarac" and "Polet," were replaced by new venues, including "Ruski car" in the Varoš Kapija area, which was popular among university professors and students. Originally named "Kod Ere," it was later renamed "Srpska kafana" and became a special place for the actors and staff of the Atelje 212 theater. Another popular kafana was "Stara Hercegovina," originally named "Skoplje," which was known as a "gastronomical Mecca" in Stari Grad. "Sunce," opened in 1966, became one of the most exclusive restaurants in the city, while "Šaran" in Zemun was originally a gathering place for local fishermen and ferry passengers. "Ušće," built in 1960, was a distinguished restaurant with a panoramic view of the city, and "Venecija" in Zemun was known for its fish soup and good ambience. "Zlatno burence," opened in 1866, was a gathering point for members of the Serbian Chetnik Organization and a recruitment center for volunteers in the Serbian-Turkish and Balkan Wars. However, by the 2020s, many of these kafanas had closed or been transformed, marking the end of an era in Belgrade's social life.

After World War II, Belgrade's nightlife dwindled due to the city's damage and population loss. However, new kafanas emerged near sports clubs and stadiums, such as "Mladi Proleter," "Sinđelić," "Obilić," and "Stadion," which became popular hangouts for footballers and athletes. Additionally, riverbank kafanas operated by fishermen in Zemun were another hub of nightlife.

During the same period, the "Lotos Bar" was renovated and opened in Zmaj Jovina Street, offering an "artistic program" that included various acts and barely dressed female dancers. It quickly became a sensation, attracting members of the new Communist political establishment and turning into a not-so-hidden prostitution locale.

It was announced that Lord Snowdon would attend the event, but he didn't show up. The venue was located at 17 Ive Lole Ribara Street (today Svetogorska), in the Jevrem Grujić's House, in Stari Grad. It was close to the Atelje 212 theatre, so at the opening almost the entire acting troop was present, so as the dramatists, authors, painters, etc., including Mira Trailović, Jovan Ćirilov, Ivan Tabaković, Dušan Matić. Founder of the disco was Lazar Šećerović, a translator, bon vivant and direct descendant of Jevrem Grujić. At the time of opening, other discos existed only in Paris, London and Milan, while it was 10 years before the famous Studio 54 in New York City was opened. Working hours were from 18:30 to 1:00, chaste compared to the modern times. The music was mostly soul: Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, The Temptations, Dusty Springfield. The venue was small, situated in the basement, but still was a major improvement in the nightlife offer in the city, credited with "democratization of fun".The club introduced several other "firsts", like girls without male companions, people dancing alone or after parties when selected groups would move to the upper floor for more quiet fun. The club was also called "Lola", after the street, and was hailed as the "only disco between Trieste and Vladivostok". Guests included members of the international jet-set who visited Belgrade: Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Catherine Deneuve, Judi Dench, Nina Ricci, Omar Sharif, Marisa Berenson, Alain Delon, Claudia Cardinale. During the day, rock bands were practicing in the club. The venue also hosted the first pop art exhibition in Yugoslavia, which included Roy Lichtenstein's graphics and Andy Warhol's lithographs.Opening was supported by the basketball club KK Crvena Zvezda. Though all the necessary permits were obtained, not everything went smooth. Municipal authorities debated about it, and some described it as a "lair for the young alcoholics, junkies, debauchers and rich kids." Owners claimed that the venue is a clean and decent location, adapted with taste which included the green Italian wallpapers and black floor linoleum. They also defended the club naming celebrities who were regular guests: Milena Dravić, Vera Čukić, Arsen Dedić, Branko Pleša, Biljana Nevajda. Neighboring citizens were against the club. They tried administratively to prevent it from being open but when that failed, they sabotaged the venue as they could, like throwing garbage at the guests who were entering the house. Concerns showed to be substantiated in the beginning, as the guests were making loud noise at the entrance and unbridled youngsters, mostly of wealthy parents, were causing too much of a commotion with their cars, vespas and motorbikes. Owners later placed two guards outside who had a specific duty to keep the noise down.The club came under the attack of numerous bans and regulations, including the one which allowed dancing, but banned music. The authorities also accused the club of playing "enemy music", of destroying the morality of the Socialist youth and declared it a CIA headquarters in Yugoslavia. Military generals in the state's Supreme Defense Council concluded that club has to be closed. Fighting both the authorities and the neighbors proved too much for the owners, so they closed the club in 1968. Still, it remains as the first such venue in entire Yugoslavia and the wider region of the Communist ruled states. For a while, secret parties continued to be organized. KST. KST, short for "Klub studenata tehnike", was unofficially established in 1952 for the students of three technical faculties (architecture, electrical engineering and civil engineering). It was located in one of the laboratories, almost in the basement, at 73 Bulevar Revolucije, today Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra.

Public reaction lacked the disputes and rage of the previous types of music, like jazz or contemporary dance in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It appeared that the older generations didn't perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS ("vocal-instrumental band").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it. One of the pioneer promoters was Nikola Karaklajić, chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. His TV show Concert for crazy young people was the most popular. It premiered in January 1967 and was aired once a month until 1969. Another popular TV show was Maksimetar (1970-1972). Among the printed media, the most influential was Džuboks, which debuted on 3 May 1966. Shy 1960s. Entry in the clubs was free or the fees were symbolic. Some had passes, but they were easily obtained. Still, the security guards had a great latitude letting someone in. People were searched and checked whether they are underage or intoxicated.

Predecessor of the future disco clubs opened in Vračar, in a private house at 33 Molerova Street in 1961, becoming one of the most important cultural hotspots in the late 1960s. The club was an offshoot of the Youth Theater DADOV, founded in 1958. The idea was that, through drinks and dance nights, the money for the theater will be collected. Once a week, a Club of the popular music lovers gathered here. The building itself was built in 1921 and was the pre-war house of the Tomić family. Performers, some of which launched their careers here, included Elipse, Safiri, Zlatni Dečaci, Dobri Drugovi, Crni Biseri, Crni Panteri (founded by the students from Congo Kinshasa), Boba Stefanović, etc.  When Crni Panteri performed Shake Your Hips, the ecstatic audience trashed and broke the furniture. The audience was mostly divided in two groups: the Beatles fans and the Rolling Stones fans. It was closed in the late 1970s. Youth Center - 202. Belgrade Youth Center, at 22 Makedonska Street, was opened in 1964, while Dancing Hall was introduced on 16 October 1966.

The disco was noted for the lack of problems or incidents and as a meeting place of the children from the wealthy families ("working class youth almost couldn't be seen in it"). In the late 1970s, it became the gathering place for the punk enthusiasts. Kod Laze Šećera. First proper disco in Belgrade, "Kod Laze Šećera", was opened on 24 April 1967. It was announced that Lord Snowdon would attend the event, but he didn't show up. The venue was located at 17 Ive Lole Ribara Street (today Svetogorska), in the Jevrem Grujić's House, in Stari Grad.

At the time of opening, other discos existed only in Paris, London and Milan, while it was 10 years before the famous Studio 54 in New York City was opened. After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to decline. However, new types of gathering places, such as night clubs or "disko[teka]" in Serbian, started to emerge in the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. The penetration of rock and roll was slow at first, but it gained momentum and became popular among the youth. The first night clubs were small and located in private houses and apartments, with city authorities often trying to close them down. One of the pioneer promoters of rock and roll was Nikola Karaklajić, a chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. The first proper disco in Belgrade, "Kod Laze Šećera", was opened in 1967, followed by the Belgrade Youth Center's discothèque "202" in 1969. The public reaction to rock and roll and the accompanying way of dancing or dressing was generally cold and indifferent, with older generations not perceiving it as a problem. Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, and no one stopped the creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS ("vocal-instrumental band"). It was patterned after the wishes of the rich and opened with an idea to gather the rich and famous, pretty girls and show-business stars. It soon achieved a status of the "club for the famous". "Duga" was opened in 1981 in Zvezdara. It was the most exclusive venue in its time. The club was a rearranged basement of the private house and over 200,000 Deutsche Marks were spent on the adaptation which was work of architect Ilija Gligorijević. It was said that an average, rich customer would "spend per night as much as a factory worker earns in a year". However, one visitor ignored the fanciful dress code and artificial manners: legendary actor Zoran Radmilović, who lived in the vicinity, would regularly come in slippers for a coffee. JAT. One of the first barges, opened in the late 1970s. It was originally intended only for the employees of the JAT Airways, but soon became a gathering place for the regular clientele, becoming a famous venue in the city. It was derelict by the 2000s, when it was sold to a private owner. Before it was renovated, the barge detached and was taken by the river downstream. The owner took emergency measures to keep it afloat, but in January 2019 it sank under the heavy snowfall. The river barge itself was considered one of the best, produced in Smederevo. Other clubs. In the mid-1980s, an expansion of new disco clubs began. Best known were:. "Bezistan", in Terazije, in the basement of the venue later adapted into the McDonald restaurant which survived until today. Bezistan was different from other discos of the era and was the only "dancing club" in the city. When the popularity of the Italo disco reached Belgrade, Bezistan organized dance competitions for participant from the entire Yugoslavia. Band Zana was promoted here, while band Aska practiced choreography for their performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 1982. Bezistan was closed in 1989..

"London", in the neighborhood of the same name.. "Panorama", in Košutnjak.. "Šestica", on the 6th floor of the Beograđanka building in downtown Belgrade, hence the name [The Six]; It worked from 20:00 to 24:00 and though operational for only three years, it was quite popular as it provided patrons with an excellent view of the city. It was the only club at the time that was not located in an adapted utility room or a basement. Still, though it occupied almost the entire floor, it was notorious for stuffiness, as the highrise's windows couldn't open.. "Taš", replaced "Cepelin"; It had the so-called "Chivas booths", which introduced whiskey as a symbol of prestige in the Belgrade's night life. Knez worked as a DJ in Taš, before he became a popular singer. With "Duga" and "Nana" made the famous "triangle" of Belgrade's night life in the 1980s.The 1980s saw the origins of the splavovi, which will experience a full expansion later in the 1990s: "Argument", the first restaurant on splav. Opened in 1983 on Ada Ciganlija, it looked like a "railroad car", without any specificities. In the 1990s it was relocated to Ušće. It was later renamed and refurbished, but is still located there. Hence, many city chroniclers take 1983 as the year the splavovi were born.. "Hua Hua", also opened in 1983, close to the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija. It was the most popular splav in the 1980s. The venue was sold in 2013.. "Savski Galeb", originally opened in 1987, it was the first such facility on the Sava Quay, in Blokovi. It was actually an adapted old freight barge. Criminal 1990s.

It was announced that Lord Snowdon would attend the event, but he didn't show up. The venue was located at 17 Ive Lole Ribara Street (today Svetogorska), in the Jevrem Grujić's House, in Stari Grad. It was close to the Atelje 212 theatre, so at the opening almost the entire acting troop was present, so as the dramatists, authors, painters, etc., including Mira Trailović, Jovan Ćirilov, Ivan Tabaković, Dušan Matić. Founder of the disco was Lazar Šećerović, a translator, bon vivant and direct descendant of Jevrem Grujić. At the time of opening, other discos existed only in Paris, London and Milan, while it was 10 years before the famous Studio 54 in New York City was opened. The tickets were pricey and the films were screened for the next six months. The Lumière brothers' camera remained in Belgrade and is kept at Yugoslav Film Archive.. 1896 - first intercity phone line established from "Kolarac" to the city of Niš. On the Belgrade side there was a concert of the vocal ensemble "Stanković", while on the Niš side it was a singers' society "Branko".. 1900s - travelling cinemas began to show movies in "Kasina", where the first permanent cinema was opened in 1910.. 1900s - "Kolarac" was a regular meeting place of young officers headed by Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, who here plotted the 1903 May Coup, which ended with the deaths of king Alexander and queen Draga, and termination of the Obrenović dynasty in 1903. Also, the first book fair in the city was held here.. 1900s - the first individual public clock in Belgrade was placed in front of the "Kod Albanije".. 1905 - elementary school "Karađorđe" established in the "Gavrilović", which operated as school by day and as kafana in the afternoon and evening. Same thing happened few years later with the elementary school "Jovan Cvijić" and the "Lavadinović" kafana.. 1910s - members of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, including Gavrilo Princip, gathered in the "Zlatna Moruna" and planned their actions, including the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, used by Austro-Hungary as the pretext for World War I.. in time, various neighborhoods of Belgrade or important buildings, were named after the kafanas: Zeleni Venac, London, Lipov Lad, Mostar, Lion, Čukarica, Cvetko, Golf, Gospodarska Mehana, Dva Bela Goluba, Palace Albanija, Ruski Car, Mihajlovac, Žagubica, Park "Tri ključa", etc.As of 2023, on the administrative territory of Belgrade, there were 18 former or still operational catering and tourist facilities which were declared cultural monuments: Modern nightlife. Prolonged dance evenings "till dawn" (igranke) were the precursors of modern nightlife after World War II. In the new, Communist regime, new types of music became almost obligatory, like the kozaračko kolo, but in the period immediately following the Allied victory this music was mixed with Russian romances, jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. Western music especially became popular after the film Sun Valley Serenade with Glenn Miller's music reached Yugoslav cinemas. Dances included tango, waltz, foxtrot, slowfox, and especially popular trucking, or treskavac in Serbian ("shaking dance"). However, with political changes regime's attitude soon switched. By the end of 1945 the American music was labeled as "capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies". Accused of undermining discipline and public moral, the trucking was officially banned in the early 1946. By 1951 the state propaganda attacked boogie-woogie ("eccentric, vulgar and decadent"), while entire public campaign was orchestrated in 1952 against jazz, which "influenced the animal sensations". This first post war period of dance nights lasted from 1945 to 1963.First night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. First rock and roll news can be found in press already in 1956. Public reaction lacked the disputes and rage of the previous types of music, like jazz or contemporary dance in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It appeared that the older generations didn't perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS ("vocal-instrumental band").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it. One of the pioneer promoters was Nikola Karaklajić, chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. His TV show Concert for crazy young people was the most popular. After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to decline. However, new types of gathering places, such as night clubs or "disko[teka]" in Serbian, started to emerge in the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. The penetration of rock and roll was slow at first, but it gained momentum and became popular among the youth. The first night clubs were small and located in private houses and apartments, with city authorities often trying to close them down. One of the pioneer promoters of rock and roll was Nikola Karaklajić, a chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. The first proper disco in Belgrade, "Kod Laze Šećera", was opened in 1967, followed by the Belgrade Youth Center's discothèque "202" in 1969. The public reaction to rock and roll and the accompanying way of dancing or dressing was generally cold and indifferent, with older generations not perceiving it as a problem. Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, and no one stopped the creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS ("vocal-instrumental band"). The first barge with a DJ, "Duga," had a separate dance floor and seating booths, initially attracting a diverse crowd but later becoming a gathering place for criminals from Zemun and New Belgrade. Similarly, "Nana," originally an elegant nightclub, became known for not playing folk music and attracting foreign diplomats, but later became notorious for a murder connected to criminals and the secret police. "Lukas," opened in 1985, gained popularity in the 1990s and became a gathering place for two criminal clans, resulting in shootouts. "Industrija," a popular techno rave club, was known for its mixed clientele and for hosting foreign DJs despite international sanctions. These barges played a significant role in Belgrade's nightlife, with some becoming associated with criminal activity and others becoming symbols of the techno and rave scene.

After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to decline. These kafanas served as the first democratic space in the new society and played a significant role in Belgrade's history, hosting numerous firsts such as the first bank, exchange office, labor market, stock exchange, insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio, and more. They also served as gathering places and recruitment centers for various wars and rebellions, and regular meeting places for young officers who plotted coups and ended dynasties.

In the early 20th century, the first intercity phone line was established, connecting "Kolarac" in Belgrade to the city of Niš. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1910, and by the 1910s, members of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, including Gavrilo Princip, gathered in the "Zlatna Moruna" and planned their actions, including the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914.

In the 1900s, the first individual public clock was placed in front of the "Kod Albanije" and the first book fair in the city was held at "Kolarac". Elementary schools were established in existing kafanas, such as "Gavrilović" and "Lavadinović".

During the Communist regime after World War II, new types of music were promoted, but by the end of 1945, American music was labeled as "capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies". Trucking was officially banned in the early 1946 and by 1951, boogie-woogie and jazz were attacked by the state propaganda.

The first night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. The penetration of rock and roll was slow at first, but gained momentum and became popular among the youth.

As of 2023, on the administrative territory of Belgrade, there were 18 former or still operational catering and tourist facilities which were declared cultural monuments. Various neighborhoods and buildings In the 19th century, kafanas in Belgrade evolved into various types, each catering to different groups such as craftsmen, farmers, and traders. Some kafanas even became debate clubs for political parties. The first hotel, "Kod jelena," was built in 1843 and introduced European entertainment traditions. Kafanas allowed patrons to stay the night, and the first electrified streetlamp in 1893 marked the beginning of "proper nightlife." The kafanas had creative names, some referencing nearby buildings or businesses. The "Amerika" kafana was notorious for prostitution, while the "Balkan" hotel was a meeting place for businesspeople and one of the few places where women could work. It had billiard tables. Notable regular guests included Vojislav Ilić, Branislav Nušić, Antun Gustav Matoš, Stevan Sremac, Radoje Domanović, Janko Veselinović, Toša Jovanović, Đura Jakšić, and Milovan Glišić. It was affectionately called "people's university". When it was to be closed, regular guests organized "farewell ceremony" - some 70 people gathered, wearing fedoras and top hats, organized by the famous Bohemian actor Čiča Ilija Stanojević, and performed a dignified farewell "with great sadness and sorrow". It was demolished in 1901, a modern National Museum in Belgrade was built instead, so the clientele moved to "Velika Srbija" and the already established kafana hub, Skadarlija. At the time, Belgrade was divided into quarters, and the Bibija stream, flowing down the Skadarlija, was an administrative border between the quarters of Palilula and Dorćol. As Palilula limited music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dorćol section to continue with festivities.As "Velika Srbija" itself was soon demolished to make way for the "Hotel Moskva", Skadarlija became the central nightlife point of Belgrade. As of 2023, "Tri šešira", founded in 1864, is the oldest, still operational kafana in Skadarlija and second overall in Belgrade, after the "?" from 1823. Even older "Gospodarska Mehana", from 1820, was closed in 2013. It was situated close to the mouth of the Topčiderka into the Sava. One of the oldest, "Grčka Kraljica", was opened in 1835 and closed in 2007."Despotov Han" inn, predecessor of "Grčka Kraljica", holds the infamy as the first recorded brothel in Belgrade, dating from the 1840s. As the prostitution was always illegal, the sex workers had to move to the streets, while the venue continued as regular kafana. The last "officially unofficial" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the Čika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building. The house was demolished much later, in the early 1990s. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903.At the turn of the 19th and the 20th century, Belgrade had one hospitality or catering venue per 50 inhabitants. After World War I, new venues were completely westernized. New hotels, with popular restaurants, were "Splendid", "Astorija", "Union", "Luksor", "Palace", etc. The social divide remained, though. Members of the lower classes couldn't afford fancy venues, like hotels "Slavija" or "Imperijal", to order Wiener schnitzel or Hungarian goulash, to listen to German or French singers or to watch magicians, jugglers and other artists. They were visiting small cookshops, soup kitchens and lowest quality venues. Among the most luxurious and exclusive nightlife locales during the Interbellum was "Srpski Kralj", at the corner of Uzun-Mirkova and Pariska streets. The lavish hotel was described as an "ornament" of the city, with "equally beautiful interior and exterior". It was completely destroyed during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. After the war, the state nationalized the lot. Despite several initiatives, it was never rebuilt. Instead, restaurant "Park" was opened, with majority of the lot becoming restaurant's garden. It was later renamed to "Central Park", before it burned to the ground in December 2012.On 30 December 1927, Ministry of Finance of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes banned night life after 23:00: those who loiter and sit till the late hours, and it is past eleven, will be fined two dinars.

Africa. Uganda. Under President Idi Amin, many Ugandan people were killed, including minority groups. Many others were tortured. South Africa. Incidents of police brutality skyrocketed by 312% from 2011 to 2012 compared to 2001 to 2002, with only 1 in 100 cases leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action from 2011 to 2012.In 2015, as a result of police officers being accused of crimes such as rape, torture, and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget. The police commissioner at the time, Riah Phiyega, blamed the large number of claims "on a highly litigious climate".Police brutality has spread throughout Soweto. Nathaniel Julius was killed in Soweto by police officers from the El Dorado police station. He was a 16 year old boy with Down Syndrome, and was shot because he didn't respond to the police officer calling him. This action was not warranted because Nathaniel didn't have any weapons on him and he was just walking from the store after buying biscuits. Two police officers were arrested over Julius' death on murder charges, after mass protests against this in the area. South African police are commonly accused of excessive force, with ten deaths attributed to police the same year (2020). Ethiopia. Egypt. Police brutality was a major contribution to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Khaled Said's death, though little has changed since. One of the "demands" around which people decided to take to the streets in Egypt was "purging the Ministry of Interior" for its brutality and torture practices. After six months of reporting gang rape, a woman in Egypt is still seeking justice not only for herself, but also those who were witnesses in her favor and are jailed, tortured in pretrial custody. The lack of investigation into the Fairmont Hotel rape case of 2014 has also put the Egyptian authorities under condemnation. Reportedly, the prime witnesses of the case have been subjected to drug testing, virginity tests and publicly defamed, while their families suffer trauma. Asia. Bangladesh. On February 21, 1952, in Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, students from the University of Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College organized a demonstration to protest the decision to establish Urdu as the only state language. Despite the enforcement of Section 144, which banned public gatherings, the students assembled peacefully. However, police were ordered to disperse the crowd. This led to the use of tear gas and eventually live ammunition against the unarmed students. Several students, including Abdul Jabbar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat, and Abdus Salam, were killed in the crackdown.In May 2017, a man named Shamim Reja was killed by police in the Sonargaon police station. The victim's father claimed that his son was tortured in the police station as the police wanted Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 600,000. Police investigated and the officer-in-charge Arup Torofar, SI Paltu Ghush, and ASP Uttam Prashad were found guilty as charged.In Shahbag, Bangladesh on 26 January 2017, hundreds of protesters against the Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company were taken into custody with extreme force by police officers. The protesters were struck by police officers and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them. China. Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Associations such as Falun Gong have objected against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and which are dispersed by riot police. Chinese protesters have been able to systematize powerful group mobilizations with the use of social media and informal mass communication like Twitter and its Chinese counterparts Weibo.In Xintang, Canton Province (Guangzhou), protests over allegations of corruption and abuse of power abound in the country – they are the principal cause of discontent in the CCP the then-CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Xintang region, Canton Province (Guangzhou), is an influential textile hub, attracting thousands of workers from all over the country, and what lit the fuse was a complaint of mistreatment against a pregnant migrant worker. Protests on 20 February used a website to urge participants not to shout more anti-government slogans, but to go outside for a quiet walk in the places where they had been deciding to continue the protest. After a brutal police response, the authorities installed corrugated metal fences outside the restaurant and the home of dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. The text discusses several incidents of alleged police brutality and excessive force in various countries, including the UK and the US. In the UK, Julian Cole was left in a vegetative state after being struck with excessive force during an arrest in 2013, and Mzee Mohammed died in police custody in 2016. In the US, there have been numerous cases of police brutality, particularly against black individuals, such as the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in Iraq and the killing of Breonna Taylor. The text highlights concerns about police accountability and the disproportionate number of black people affected by police violence. The US has a significantly higher number of police killings compared to other Western countries, with a far greater number of black people being killed by police. The FBI has reported that black people make up a disproportionate number of those killed by police and assaulted by officers. A study published in The Lancet found that over 30,000 people were killed by police in the US between 1980 and 2018. The text discusses police brutality in various countries, with a focus on Greece, Hungary, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. In Greece, there have been numerous incidents of police brutality during protests, often resulting in severe injuries and a lack of medical assistance for victims. Hungary's police academy requires a high school diploma, a matriculation exam, and two years of study, which is longer than some countries but lacks sufficient practical training. Northern Ireland has a history of police brutality, particularly during the Troubles, and there are ongoing concerns about harassment and discrimination against Catholics. The Republic of Ireland's police force, the Garda Síochána, allows "reasonable force" but has faced international concern over excessive use of force and has implemented new procedures to address these issues. Italy has also faced issues with police brutality, including beatings, violence during demonstrations, and several murders. The text emphasizes the need for accountability, improved training, and addressing systemic issues to prevent police brutality. The text describes various incidents of police brutality in Greece, particularly during protests, with little accountability for the officers involved. It highlights the severe injuries and lack of medical assistance for victims, as well as the use of tactics such as human shields. Specific examples are given of protesters and journalists who have suffered injuries due to police actions. The text also briefly mentions police brutality in Hungary and its history of discrimination against the Roma minority, as well as the issue of police brutality in Northern Ireland. It is urged that authorities investigate these incidents and hold those responsible accountable, and improve police training programs to ensure ethical judgments and proportional use of force.

In South Africa, police brutality has been a persistent issue, with a significant increase in incidents and custodial deaths from 2011 to 2012. The high cost of civil liabilities due to police misconduct has also been a concern. In Egypt, police brutality was a major factor in the 2011 revolution, and there have been continued reports of excessive force, torture, and a lack of justice for victims. In Bangladesh, there have been instances of lethal force used against peaceful protesters, such as the 1952 Dhaka protests and the 2017 Shahbag protests. In China, politically motivated protests have been met with force, and there have been reports of social media being used to mobilize protesters. After the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 27.9% increase in police killings in Brazil, 17 organizations, including Observatório de Favelas, Maré Vive, Instituto Marielle Franco, Cesec, and Grupo de Estudo dos Novos Legalismos/UFF, filed a petition (ADPF 635) with Brazil's Supreme Court. The court suspended police operations, which reduced mortality rates by 72.5% and criminality rates by 37.9% to 47.7%. However, Rio de Janeiro's police, who complained about the decision, have not always followed the order, leading to incidents like the Jacarezinho Favela raid and Kathlen Romeu's killing. Similar issues of police brutality have occurred in Colombia, Chile, and Venezuela. In Chile, Carabineros de Chile has been accused of abuse, particularly towards students and the Mapuche people, while in Venezuela, security forces have reportedly used excessive force during protests. It was found through Kaiser Family Foundation research that almost half of Black Americans believe they have been victimized by law enforcement. The FBI 2019 Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, Table 42 reports that black persons were responsible for 37% of all officers killed from 2012 through 2019.According to a 2021 study published in The Lancet, more than 30,000 people were killed by police in the United States between 1980 and 2018. Around 2,500 of those killed by police from 2015 to 2022 were fleeing. Examples. Breonna Taylor was killed at the age of 26 when police forced entry into the apartment as part of an investigation into drug dealing operations. Officers said that they announced themselves as police before forcing entry, but Walker said he did not hear any announcement, thought the officers were intruders, and fired a warning shot at them and hit Mattingly in the leg, and the officers fired 32 shots in return. Walker was unhurt but Taylor was hit by six bullets and died. On 23 September, a state grand jury found the shooting of Taylor justified but indicted officer Hankison on three counts of wanton endangerment for endangering Taylor's neighbors with his shots.On 25 May 2020, George Floyd, an unarmed African American man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck for over nine minutes (9:29 seconds) while three other officers appeared to restrain his back and legs.
