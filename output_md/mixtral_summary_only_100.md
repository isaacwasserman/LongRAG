- Robert Picardo, born in Spain in 1919, pursued architecture after his initial plans to join the navy and study law were disrupted. He trained under architect Luis Moya Blanco during the Spanish Civil War and began his career by painting murals and illustrating architectural magazines. Known for his mastery of perspective, Picardo's work showed increasing sophistication and complexity. After qualifying in 1951, he collaborated on building preservation and restoration projects with architect Fernando Chueca Goitia. Inspired by the Alhambra in Granada, Picardo was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" in 1952, which aimed to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture.
- The text is about a Spanish architect, Picardo, who won the Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura in 2001 for his contributions to architectural renovation. The prize, awarded every two years since 1985, honors an architect who has made significant strides in preserving Spain's historical heritage. Picardo, the ninth winner, was praised for his knowledge of Spanish culture and his quiet, yet impactful, professional activity. He was married to Trinidad de Ribera Talavera and had five children. A US travel journalist described him as "a package of energy, wit, and imagination" with twinkling eyes. Picardo passed away in Madrid on July 27, 2010. In 1953, his sons donated a portrait of him, painted at the age of 34, to the academy.
- The text discusses several architectural projects by Picardo. The first project is a building in Arcos with dining and sitting rooms overlooking a river, featuring Andalucían architectural elements and ceramic tiles. Initially, 9 of the planned 18 guest rooms were built, with an extension added in 1974. The second project is a hosteria in Pedraza, converted from the Casa de la Inquisición, which only contains a restaurant and bar. Picardo renovated the exterior and interior, adding his signature open wooden gallery and rustic-style furniture. He also planned to expand the property with neighboring buildings, but the project was not realized. The third project is the conversion of the Palacio de los Comendadores in Alcañiz into a Parador, which involved renovating the oldest parts of the castle and adding 12 guest rooms. Picardo had to work within the limitations of the available space and the existing structure.
- Picardo was a renowned architect known for his restoration and modern building projects. He worked on several historic sites, including the Catedral de Cádiz, Real Monasterio de Santa María de Guadalupe, and Catedral de Santa María de Sigüenza. His designs combined classical and contemporary styles, as seen in his award-winning Fundación Juan March building in Madrid. Completed in 1975, this project features a simple, elegant design with alternating ribbon windows and marble cladding. The building houses various facilities, such as assembly halls, libraries, offices, and underground parking. Picardo also integrated artwork into the architecture and designed a garden for the property. The project received critical acclaim, with observers praising its proportions and spatial arrangement. Picardo considered this building his best work.
- José Luis Picardo was an acclaimed muralist and illustrator, particularly known for his detailed architectural drawings. His work was highly regarded by leading Spanish restoration architects, including Leopoldo Torres Balbás and Luis Menéndez-Pidal y Álvarez. In 1959, Picardo was commissioned to design a pack of baraja de naipes for the Spanish fashion brand Loewe, which are now collectors' items. He also created a set of wooden chess pieces in 1960.

Picardo was recognized by the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) with the publication of a book of his drawings in 1960. From the early 1960s to 1985, he dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de España, where he worked on the restoration and construction of historical buildings, creating luxurious modern hotels that maintained and embellished the monuments' ancient appearance. His work for Paradores is highly regarded by other professionals and hotel guests.
- Architect Picardo is known for his skilled restoration and construction of historical buildings for Paradores de Turismo in Spain, with his work influencing Portuguese architects as well. His first project, the Parador de Guadalupe, involved converting two ancient buildings into a hotel while preserving their original Mudéjar style. He used ancient construction techniques and incorporated decorative elements such as clay tile flooring and decorative wall tiles. The hotel opened in 1965 and Picardo was later invited back to add a new wing. He also designed a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén.
- The castle in Alcañiz, originally a military palace, was in disrepair but declared a National Monument in 1925. When Picardo was hired to renovate it into a Parador, he faced limited space and could only create 12 guest rooms. He converted the ground floor's entrance into a reception area and the old stables into a bar and cafetería. The main dining room was situated on the first floor, and guest rooms were on the second floor with raised areas for window viewing. Picardo focused on medieval design for the ground floor and a more palatial look for the upper floors. He also incorporated his characteristic ceramic murals and the emblem of the Order of Calatrava in the decoration. In 1975, Picardo designed a two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998, bringing the total to 38.

Picardo was also commissioned to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alcúescar in Cáceres, a medieval fortified residence with later Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque elements. He focused on converting a jumble of old buildings, mostly stables and coach houses, into a Hostería. Picardo demolished most of the service buildings, keeping a square structure with substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. He used many architectural elements from the demolished buildings in the new construction and made the lower ground floor of the kept building the bar and cafetería, with a doorway from the street as the main entrance to the Hostería.
- Architect Picardo was inspired by the consistent elements of Spanish architecture, as seen in the Alhambra in Granada. He was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" of 1952, which sought to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture. This inspiration guided much of his work, particularly in his designs for Paradores. During the 1950s, Picardo pursued personal ambitions, entering competitions and publishing uncommissioned building plans. He co-designed an apartment building near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas and built houses in Andalucían style on the Costa del Sol. He also received commissions for decorative mural paintings and illustrations in architectural textbooks. In 1959, he was commissioned to design a pack of playing cards for the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. Picardo was known for his skills as a draughtsman and muralist, and his published architectural drawings were highly regarded.
- The castle in Carmona, originally a Muslim structure, was transformed into a luxurious palace by Pedro I in the 14th century. However, it was abandoned after being severely damaged in earthquakes in 1504 and 1755. In the late 1960s, architect Picardo was commissioned to build a Parador, a state-owned hotel, on the castle grounds. The chosen location had previously been found to have a deep crack and subsidence due to the 1918 earthquake, but this was not discovered until construction began in 1969. After geological intervention, the ground was deemed stable enough for construction to continue with protective measures.

Picardo designed the Parador with a typical Hispanic-Arabic layout, including two central patios and four floors on the southern and eastern walls, which would house guest rooms. The building's exterior would have a historic appearance, while the interior would feature a palatial Mudéjar style with coffered ceilings, star lattice-work, and ceramic tiling. The original plan for 33 guest rooms was expanded to 102 due to a delay in construction. The main structure was made of concrete, clad with ashlar and brickwork, and topped with a clay pantile roof.
- In the 1960s, architect Picardo was commissioned to design a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén, Andalucía, which was built on a former Moorish fortress. The new wing, built in a simple hostería style, increased the number of guest rooms to 41, but its location on a steep hill and addition to the original design resulted in a complicated layout with many staircases and lifts. Picardo used stone, brick, timber, and iron to clad the building, giving the appearance of age and hiding the modern supporting structure. He also incorporated medieval elements in the interior design and used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior. The building was later extended in 1969 and 1973, adding service rooms and 24 more guest rooms, bringing the total to 43. The extension elongated the building, resulting in long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. The building was renamed Parador after the extension was completed and inaugurated in 1978.

- In 1975, architect Juan Picardo completed a notable building in Madrid, featuring sculptures by Eduardo Chillida, Pablo Serrano, and Joaquín Vaquero Turcios. The adjacent garden, also designed by Picardo, is a significant part of the project. In 1978, Picardo was commissioned to build a public indoor riding arena, the Sal de Equitación, for the Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Equestre in Jerez de la Frontera, his hometown. The arena, which references Andalusian architecture and culture, was completed in 1980. Later, Picardo and architect José García María de Paredes designed a secure display for Pablo Picasso's Guernica at the Museo Nacional del Prado, using armored glass and a steel polyhedron case to protect the painting.

- In 1981, a display case for Picasso's painting Guernica was created using 18mm triple armoured glass, despite it being smaller than the painting. The case was built with bevels meeting the floor, walls, and ceiling, and angled to avoid reflections. Illumination was placed inside the case. The painting was moved to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in 1992. Picardo, the architect, was elected to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1997 and gifted the academy a painting in 2000. He won the Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura in 2001 for his contributions to architectural renovation.

- The text discusses the work of architect Don José Luis Picardo on the Parador in Sigüenza, Spain. Picardo aimed to restore the medieval character of the exterior, and his work was completed in 1976. Further remodeling and modernization took place in 1990, but the Parador retained its original character. Picardo also worked on investigating and proposing plans for converting other old buildings into Paradores, although not all of these projects came to fruition during his lifetime. The text notes that rehabilitation projects during this time period, including Picardo's, were often carried out without archaeological research. Instead, they were planned based on historical and architectural research.

- The Ministry of Information and Tourism proposed turning part of a palace into a Hostería, which was constructed by Picardo. He decided to keep a square structure with substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults, converting its lower ground floor into a bar and cafetería. Three more floors were added, reusing architectural elements from the demolished buildings. A sgraffito image of the cross of the Orden de Santiago was installed above the main entrance. A new one-storey building was built to the rear, imitating similar buildings in the city, and service areas were excavated beneath the buildings. Picardo also designed a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden. The Hostería opened in 1971, and Picardo later re-roofed the palace and extended the original dining room area. The Hostería was closed in 1984, and the rest of the palace was converted into a Parador with 27 guest rooms, opening in 1989. Picardo was not involved in this work.

Picardo was also commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near Sevilla, including the Alcázar del Rey Don Pedro in Carmona, with a view to constructing a Parador. He chose the southeast of the vast castle area, a corner known as the Plaza de Armas (parade ground), to build the Parador. The castle was probably Muslim in origin and was restored in the 14th century into a lavish palace in Mudéjar style. It was used by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain during their final battles with the Moors in Granada but was abandoned after being severely damaged in earthquakes. Seven towers remained, but most of the connecting walls of the fortress were in ruins.

- In 1978, an extension designed by Picardo added 24 guest rooms to the Jaén Parador, a hotel in Spain, raising the total to 43. The extension's design was constrained by the land's layout and building height limits, resulting in long corridors and distances between areas. Picardo also designed the interior, creating medieval-style furniture, decorations, and tile patterns, using coats of arms and ceramic tiles to share the building's history and credit those involved. The architecture and design approach was later used in other Paradores projects.

The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, located in Andalucía, was built on a triangular site overlooking the Rio Guadalete. Picardo preserved the façades of buildings facing the Plaza de España and the castle while demolishing the rest, keeping seven 2.35-meter columns for reuse. A 15-centimeter crack from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake led to the construction of an independent patio deck. The building, featuring Andalucían architectural elements, has an entrance hallway, a patio, and terracing with seven columns. Picardo designed the interior furniture, fittings, lighting, and decoration, using ceramic tiles for both design and explanatory texts. Initially, only nine of the planned 18 guest rooms were built.

The hotel opened in 1965 and Picardo was later invited back to add a new wing. He also designed a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén.
- Architect José Luis Picardo reconstructed the Castillo de los Obispos de Sigüenza, preserving its historical elements while incorporating modern materials. He minimized exterior windows and added many window openings in the courtyard walls to allow light into the interior. The castle's north wall now features a main reception area, portico, and bedrooms with terraces. The northeast corner of the ground floor holds the main guest lounge, and the east side features a dining room with a vaulted ceiling and a bar on the courtyard side. Guest rooms and lounges are located on the upper floors, and Picardo's signature medieval-style interior decor is found throughout. A small monastic courtyard and banqueting hall were added at the southern end. Picardo built 80 guest rooms and two suites, providing lodging for 162 guests. A mural in the entrance hall details the castle's history and restoration. The Parador opened in 1976 and was later modernized while maintaining its original character.

- In the 1960s and 1970s, architect Fernando Picardo rehabilitated several castles and convents in Spain, including the Parador at Ciudad Rodrigo, without archaeological research to save on costs and time. This approach is now criticized by archaeologists and historians. Picardo's work at Sigüenza, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been particularly decried. Dr. María José Rodríguez Pérez has studied Picardo's work and described his objective as creating a convincing set design to evoke the historical era of interest to tourists, typically the medieval period. She has criticized new extensions designed to match monuments as "false history."

Picardo, however, saw his reconstructions as justifiable if they were Art. He used modern construction techniques and concealed them with traditional materials to make buildings look old. One Spanish academic has noted Picardo's impressive use of modern techniques while maintaining the traditional appearance. Despite current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores, particularly those at Jäen, Carmona, and Sigüenza, remain popular. Picardo also carried out restoration works on several other historical buildings in Spain, showcasing his knowledge of classical styles.
- The castle in Alcañiz, originally a military palace, was in disrepair but declared a National Monument in 1925. When Picardo was hired to renovate it into a Parador, he faced limited space and could only create 12 guest rooms. He converted the ground floor's entrance into a reception area and the old stables into a bar and cafetería. The main dining room was situated on the first floor, and guest rooms were on the second floor with raised areas for window viewing. Picardo focused on medieval design for the ground floor and a more palatial look for the upper floors. He also incorporated his characteristic ceramic murals and the emblem of the Order of Calatrava in the decoration. In 1975, Picardo designed a two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998, bringing the total to 38.

Picardo was also commissioned to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alcúescar in Cáceres, a medieval fortified residence with later Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque elements. He focused on converting a jumble of old buildings, mostly stables and coach houses, into a Hostería. Picardo demolished most of the service buildings, keeping a square structure with substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. He used many architectural elements from the demolished buildings in the new construction and made the lower ground floor of the kept building the bar and cafetería, with a doorway from the street as the main entrance to the Hostería.
- The castle in Carmona, originally a Muslim structure, was transformed into a luxurious palace by Pedro I in the 14th century. However, it was abandoned after being severely damaged in earthquakes in 1504 and 1755. In the late 1960s, architect Picardo was commissioned to build a Parador, a state-owned hotel, on the castle grounds. The chosen location had previously been found to have a deep crack and subsidence due to the 1918 earthquake, but this was not discovered until construction began in 1969. After geological intervention, the ground was deemed stable enough for construction to continue with protective measures.

Picardo designed the Parador with a typical Hispanic-Arabic layout, including two central patios and four floors on the southern and eastern walls, which would house guest rooms. The building's exterior would have a historic appearance, while the interior would feature a palatial Mudéjar style with coffered ceilings, star lattice-work, and ceramic tiling. The original plan for 33 guest rooms was expanded to 102 due to a delay in construction. The main structure was made of concrete, clad with ashlar and brickwork, and topped with a clay pantile roof.
- The Carmona Parador, designed by Picardo, is known for its clay pantile roof, decorative chimneys, limestone columns, ceramic tiling, and brick and marble/terracotta floors. The interior features a Hispanic-Arabic ambience with coffered ceilings, star lattice-work, and unique furniture and fixtures, all designed by Picardo. The building had structural issues since its inauguration in 1976, including cracks and lateral displacement, leading to underpinning and anchoring. Despite improvements and modernizations, the building remains at risk in case of water table rise or earthquakes.

Picardo was also involved in the investigation of old buildings for a new Parador in the Province of Guadalajara, considering the Castle of Sigüenza the best proposition despite being ruined. The castle, with Iberian, Roman, Visigothic, and Moorish origins, was enlarged and modified several times before declining and deteriorating. It was left in ruins for over three decades before Picardo started analyzing its condition in 1969.

- The text discusses several architectural projects by Picardo. The first project is a building in Arcos with dining and sitting rooms overlooking a river, featuring Andalucían architectural elements and ceramic tiles. Initially, 9 of the planned 18 guest rooms were built, with an extension added in 1974. The second project is a hosteria in Pedraza, converted from the Casa de la Inquisición, which only contains a restaurant and bar. Picardo renovated the exterior and interior, adding his signature open wooden gallery and rustic-style furniture. He also planned to expand the property with neighboring buildings, but the project was not realized. The third project is the conversion of the Palacio de los Comendadores in Alcañiz into a Parador, which involved renovating the oldest parts of the castle and adding 12 guest rooms. Picardo had to work within the limitations of the available space and the existing structure.
- Architect Picardo is known for his skilled restoration and construction of historical buildings for Paradores de Turismo in Spain, with his work influencing Portuguese architects as well. His first project, the Parador de Guadalupe, involved converting two ancient buildings into a hotel while preserving their original Mudéjar style. He used ancient construction techniques and incorporated decorative elements such as clay tile flooring and decorative wall tiles. The hotel opened in 1965 and Picardo was later invited back to add a new wing. He also designed a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina in Jaén.
- In 1978, an extension designed by Picardo added 24 guest rooms to the Jaén Parador, a hotel in Spain, raising the total to 43. The extension's design was constrained by the land's layout and building height limits, resulting in long corridors and distances between areas. Picardo also designed the interior, creating medieval-style furniture, decorations, and tile patterns, using coats of arms and ceramic tiles to share the building's history and credit those involved. The architecture and design approach was later used in other Paradores projects.

The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, located in Andalucía, was built on a triangular site overlooking the Rio Guadalete. Picardo preserved the façades of buildings facing the Plaza de España and the castle while demolishing the rest, keeping seven 2.35-meter columns for reuse. A 15-centimeter crack from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake led to the construction of an independent patio deck. The building, featuring Andalucían architectural elements, has an entrance hallway, a patio, and terracing with seven columns. Picardo designed the interior furniture, fittings, lighting, and decoration, using ceramic tiles for both design and explanatory texts. Initially, only nine of the planned 18 guest rooms were built.
- In the 1960s and 1970s, architect Fernando Picardo rehabilitated several castles and convents in Spain, including the Parador at Ciudad Rodrigo, without archaeological research to save on costs and time. This approach is now criticized by archaeologists and historians. Picardo's work at Sigüenza, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been particularly decried. Dr. María José Rodríguez Pérez has studied Picardo's work and described his objective as creating a convincing set design to evoke the historical era of interest to tourists, typically the medieval period. She has criticized new extensions designed to match monuments as "false history."

Picardo, however, saw his reconstructions as justifiable if they were Art. He used modern construction techniques and concealed them with traditional materials to make buildings look old. One Spanish academic has noted Picardo's impressive use of modern techniques while maintaining the traditional appearance. Despite current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores, particularly those at Jäen, Carmona, and Sigüenza, remain popular. Picardo also carried out restoration works on several other historical buildings in Spain, showcasing his knowledge of classical styles.
- The text discusses the work of architect Don José Luis Picardo on the Parador in Sigüenza, Spain. Picardo aimed to restore the medieval character of the exterior, and his work was completed in 1976. Further remodeling and modernization took place in 1990, but the Parador retained its original character. Picardo also worked on investigating and proposing plans for converting other old buildings into Paradores, although not all of these projects came to fruition during his lifetime. The text notes that rehabilitation projects during this time period, including Picardo's, were often carried out without archaeological research. Instead, they were planned based on historical and architectural research.
- Picardo was a renowned architect known for his restoration and modern building projects. He worked on several historic sites, including the Catedral de Cádiz, Real Monasterio de Santa María de Guadalupe, and Catedral de Santa María de Sigüenza. His designs combined classical and contemporary styles, as seen in his award-winning Fundación Juan March building in Madrid. Completed in 1975, this project features a simple, elegant design with alternating ribbon windows and marble cladding. The building houses various facilities, such as assembly halls, libraries, offices, and underground parking. Picardo also integrated artwork into the architecture and designed a garden for the property. The project received critical acclaim, with observers praising its proportions and spatial arrangement. Picardo considered this building his best work.
- The Carmona Parador, designed by Picardo, is known for its clay pantile roof, decorative chimneys, limestone columns, ceramic tiling, and brick and marble/terracotta floors. The interior features a Hispanic-Arabic ambience with coffered ceilings, star lattice-work, and unique furniture and fixtures, all designed by Picardo. The building had structural issues since its inauguration in 1976, including cracks and lateral displacement, leading to underpinning and anchoring. Despite improvements and modernizations, the building remains at risk in case of water table rise or earthquakes.

Picardo was also involved in the investigation of old buildings for a new Parador in the Province of Guadalajara, considering the Castle of Sigüenza the best proposition despite being ruined. The castle, with Iberian, Roman, Visigothic, and Moorish origins, was enlarged and modified several times before declining and deteriorating. It was left in ruins for over three decades before Picardo started analyzing its condition in 1969.
- The Ministry of Information and Tourism proposed turning part of a palace into a Hostería, which was constructed by Picardo. He decided to keep a square structure with substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults, converting its lower ground floor into a bar and cafetería. Three more floors were added, reusing architectural elements from the demolished buildings. A sgraffito image of the cross of the Orden de Santiago was installed above the main entrance. A new one-storey building was built to the rear, imitating similar buildings in the city, and service areas were excavated beneath the buildings. Picardo also designed a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden. The Hostería opened in 1971, and Picardo later re-roofed the palace and extended the original dining room area. The Hostería was closed in 1984, and the rest of the palace was converted into a Parador with 27 guest rooms, opening in 1989. Picardo was not involved in this work.

Picardo was also commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near Sevilla, including the Alcázar del Rey Don Pedro in Carmona, with a view to constructing a Parador. He chose the southeast of the vast castle area, a corner known as the Plaza de Armas (parade ground), to build the Parador. The castle was probably Muslim in origin and was restored in the 14th century into a lavish palace in Mudéjar style. It was used by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain during their final battles with the Moors in Granada but was abandoned after being severely damaged in earthquakes. Seven towers remained, but most of the connecting walls of the fortress were in ruins.
- Architect Picardo was inspired by the consistent elements of Spanish architecture, as seen in the Alhambra in Granada. He was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" of 1952, which sought to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture. This inspiration guided much of his work, particularly in his designs for Paradores. During the 1950s, Picardo pursued personal ambitions, entering competitions and publishing uncommissioned building plans. He co-designed an apartment building near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas and built houses in Andalucían style on the Costa del Sol. He also received commissions for decorative mural paintings and illustrations in architectural textbooks. In 1959, he was commissioned to design a pack of playing cards for the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. Picardo was known for his skills as a draughtsman and muralist, and his published architectural drawings were highly regarded.

True



## question

All of historians speak highly of Picardo's work, is this true? Why?

## ground_truth

False, because some people believe that Parrado destroyed the part of historical and architectural.

## generated_answer

 No, this is not entirely true. While Picardo's work is highly regarded by many, particularly for his mastery of perspective, restoration projects, and modern building designs, some historians criticize his approach to rehabilitating historical buildings.

- Robert Picardo, born in Spain in 1919, pursued architecture after his initial plans to join the navy and study law were disrupted. He trained under architect Luis Moya Blanco during the Spanish Civil War and began his career by painting murals and illustrating architectural magazines. Known for his mastery of perspective, Picardo's work showed increasing sophistication and complexity. After qualifying in 1951, he collaborated on building preservation and restoration projects with architect Fernando Chueca Goitia. Inspired by the Alhambra in Granada, Picardo was a signatory of the "Manifiesto de la Alhambra" in 1952, which aimed to create a distinctly Spanish form of modern architecture.

- The text is about a Spanish architect, Picardo, who won the Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura in 2001 for his contributions to architectural renovation. The prize, awarded every two years since 1985, honors an architect who has made significant strides in preserving Spain's historical heritage. Picardo, the ninth winner, was praised for his knowledge of Spanish culture and his quiet, yet impactful, professional activity. He was married to Trinidad de Ribera Talavera and had five children. A US travel journalist described him as "a package of energy, wit, and imagination" with twinkling eyes. Picardo passed away in Madrid on July 27, 2010. In 1953, his sons donated a portrait of him, painted at the age of 34, to the academy.

- Barcelona has 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods. The district of Ciutat Vella, the oldest part of the city, has the lowest socioeconomic level population and is the main tourist attraction due to its numerous monuments and ancient architecture. Eixample, which was built during the expansion of the old city, is a densely populated district and is known for its modernist architectural works and commercial activity. Sants-Montjuïc, the largest district, has a low population density, high percentage of green area, and includes the Montjuïc mountain and Zona Franca. Les Corts, originally an agricultural area, has a high rate of young people and middle class population, and is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, one of the largest districts, has the lowest population density and is a high status residential area with a predominance of single-family houses. Gràcia, with its high population density, has a high percentage of elderly people and lower-middle class population. Horta-Guinardó, originally an agricultural area and summer residences, has a low population density, young and lower-middle class population.
- The text describes four districts in Barcelona, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Horta-Guinardó, the oldest of the four, was once an agricultural area that became urbanized and industrialized in the early 1800s. It has a high population density and a large elderly population, with most residents being of lower-middle class. Nou Barris, the most recently created district, is located on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar and has a majority immigrant population that has suffered from real estate speculation and lack of assistance. Sant Andreu, which was once an agricultural and milling area, experienced industrialization in the mid-1800s and later received a wave of immigrant population. Sant Martí, another district that was once agricultural, underwent deindustrialization in recent decades and has seen an influx of new technology-based economic activities.

Historically, Barcelona's administrative division has changed over time. The city was first divided into four quarters in 1389, with a grid system that separated the northern and southern quarters along the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This division highlighted the social differences between the different parts of the city. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, and in 1769, the city was reformed to create five quarters, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century for political reasons.
- The Cerdà Plan, proposed in the mid-19th century, aimed to expand Barcelona with 16-meter tall buildings arranged in 20x20 block sectors, divided into districts and neighborhoods with specific facilities. The expansion was to be accompanied by better hygiene, circulation, and multipurpose design. However, due to opposition and real estate speculation, many of these plans were not realized. The city's interior also needed modernization, leading to plans like those of Miquel Garriga i Roca and Àngel Baixeras, which focused on realigning streets and creating major thoroughfares in the old city center.
- Barcelona has undergone several administrative divisions throughout its history. In the 15th century, it was divided into two quarters, which increased to five in the 18th century. The 19th century saw numerous divisions for political reasons, with the city divided into four districts in 1837 and ten in 1878. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, neighboring municipalities were added, and the city was reorganized into ten districts. In 1933, two more districts were added, and in 1984, the current division into ten districts was approved to decentralize the City Council. The last reform in 2006 established 73 neighborhoods, causing controversy due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods. Barcelona's history dates back to the 1st century BC when it was founded as Barcino by Roman colonizers.
- The 21st century has seen significant urban renewal in Barcelona, with a focus on new technology companies and the regeneration of areas like the Poblenou neighborhood and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to the recovery of the Besòs area and the creation of new parks and leisure spaces. The urban planning of the new millennium has reinforced the grid structure, leading to the emergence of new urban centers and the improvement of communications, including the high-speed train, expanded port and airport, and an automated metro network. Pedestrian transit has been facilitated through elevators and escalators, and new green spaces have been created, such as the Central Park of Nou Barris and the Diagonal Mar Park. In 2015, the drafting of a new Urban Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona began, with objectives including classifying metropolitan land, establishing building regulations, and defining areas for sustainable development.
- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban expansion due to population growth and poor health conditions caused by high population density within the city walls. After much public outcry, the walls were finally demolished in 1854, allowing for the city's territorial expansion. A competition was held for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias, but ultimately overruled in favor of Ildefons Cerdà's innovative plan. Cerdà's plan featured an orthogonal layout with wide streets, open spaces for gardens, and designated areas for public services and facilities. The buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan, and the distribution of the Eixample was divided into sectors, districts, and neighborhoods, each with their own designated public amenities. Although not all of Cerdà's plans were fully realized, his project had a significant impact on the development of Barcelona and was innovative for its time, particularly in its consideration of green spaces and service areas.
- Barcelona, the capital and largest city of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant on the Mediterranean coast, between 41°16' and 41°30' north latitude and 1°54' and 2°18' east longitude. The city is situated on a 102.16 km² plain, surrounded by the sea, the Collserola mountain range, and the deltas of the Besós and Llobregat rivers. Barcelona's climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and low rainfall. The city's terrain is hilly and was once covered in torrents and streams, which have since been replaced by built-up areas. Barcelona is the most significant urban center in Catalonia, serving as the seat of the autonomous government, the Parliament of Catalonia, and other important institutions. It is the second most populous city in Spain, with a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods, including the old core of the city and the Barceloneta neighborhood, which has seen significant immigration from both Spain and other countries.
- Barcelona underwent significant urban planning and development between 1989 and 2004. The planning was directed by Josep Acebillo, Alfred Morales, and Josep Emili Hernández-Cros, among others. Three ring roads were created, and a campaign to restore facades, monuments, and dividing walls, known as "Barcelona posa't guapa," was implemented. The 1992 Olympics served as a catalyst for strategic urban planning and led to the development of the "Barcelona model," an integrative urban reform project. The late 1990s saw a shift towards sustainable urban planning, with an emphasis on public spaces and community facilities. The use of bicycles as a more environmentally friendly means of transport was promoted, and the Bicing bicycle rental company was established in 2007. The Pla Director d'Infraestructures (Infrastructure Master Plan) marked the expansion and improvement of public transport. In the 21st century, the city continued to focus on innovation, design, new technologies, and environmental sustainability. The Urban Strategies Advisory Council was created, and the 22@ district was established in the El Poblenou neighborhood to promote new technology companies. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to further urban changes, including the regeneration of the Poblenou neighborhood and the creation of the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood.
- The PDU plan in Barcelona aims to transform the metropolitan area, made up of 36 municipalities, by classifying land, establishing building regulations, and defining areas for sustainable development. The plan also seeks to preserve the environment, respect forest and agricultural land, and ensure proper mobility. A pilot test of creating "superblocks" with restricted vehicle traffic was successful in Poblenou, and a new phase began in 2020 in the Eixample district to establish 42 new green axes and squares by 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic led to urban planning changes, such as setting aside spaces for pedestrians and enabling terraces for bars and restaurants, some of which became permanent. The PDU plan and these changes aim to promote sustainable development goals.

The city was first divided into four quarters in 1389, with a grid system that separated the northern and southern quarters along the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This division highlighted the social differences between the different parts of the city. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, and in 1769, the city was reformed to create five quarters, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century for political reasons.
- The 21st century has seen significant urban renewal in Barcelona, with a focus on new technology companies and the regeneration of areas like the Poblenou neighborhood and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to the recovery of the Besòs area and the creation of new parks and leisure spaces. The urban planning of the new millennium has reinforced the grid structure, leading to the emergence of new urban centers and the improvement of communications, including the high-speed train, expanded port and airport, and an automated metro network. Pedestrian transit has been facilitated through elevators and escalators, and new green spaces have been created, such as the Central Park of Nou Barris and the Diagonal Mar Park. In 2015, the drafting of a new Urban Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona began, with objectives including classifying metropolitan land, establishing building regulations, and defining areas for sustainable development.
- Barcelona has undergone several administrative divisions throughout its history. In the 15th century, it was divided into two quarters, which increased to five in the 18th century. The 19th century saw numerous divisions for political reasons, with the city divided into four districts in 1837 and ten in 1878. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, neighboring municipalities were added, and the city was reorganized into ten districts. In 1933, two more districts were added, and in 1984, the current division into ten districts was approved to decentralize the City Council. The last reform in 2006 established 73 neighborhoods, causing controversy due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods. Barcelona's history dates back to the 1st century BC when it was founded as Barcino by Roman colonizers.
- The Cerdà Plan, proposed in the mid-19th century, aimed to expand Barcelona with 16-meter tall buildings arranged in 20x20 block sectors, divided into districts and neighborhoods with specific facilities. The expansion was to be accompanied by better hygiene, circulation, and multipurpose design. However, due to opposition and real estate speculation, many of these plans were not realized. The city's interior also needed modernization, leading to plans like those of Miquel Garriga i Roca and Àngel Baixeras, which focused on realigning streets and creating major thoroughfares in the old city center.
- Barcelona underwent significant urban planning and development between 1989 and 2004. The planning was directed by Josep Acebillo, Alfred Morales, and Josep Emili Hernández-Cros, among others. Three ring roads were created, and a campaign to restore facades, monuments, and dividing walls, known as "Barcelona posa't guapa," was implemented. The 1992 Olympics served as a catalyst for strategic urban planning and led to the development of the "Barcelona model," an integrative urban reform project. The late 1990s saw a shift towards sustainable urban planning, with an emphasis on public spaces and community facilities. The use of bicycles as a more environmentally friendly means of transport was promoted, and the Bicing bicycle rental company was established in 2007. The Pla Director d'Infraestructures (Infrastructure Master Plan) marked the expansion and improvement of public transport. In the 21st century, the city continued to focus on innovation, design, new technologies, and environmental sustainability. The Urban Strategies Advisory Council was created, and the 22@ district was established in the El Poblenou neighborhood to promote new technology companies. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to further urban changes, including the regeneration of the Poblenou neighborhood and the creation of the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood.
- The growth of Barcelona's suburbs in the post-war period led to the concept of "Great Barcelona," with neighboring municipalities experiencing significant expansion due to real estate speculation, facilitated by the 1942 Municipal Ordinances reform. In 1945, Pedro Bidagor initiated the Regional Plan of 1953 to integrate the city and surroundings, addressing housing demand and speculation, and improving the urban environment. The Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956 aimed to rationalize urban development, while the Regional Plan zoned areas for growth, infrastructure, facilities, and green spaces, like the Collserola mountain range park.

Despite not being fully implemented, partial plans emerged, often catering to landowners' interests and increasing population density. New neighborhoods led to the construction of new markets and the improvement of the city's road network, including Meridiana Avenue, the First and Second Ring Roads, subway parking lots, and the 1962 arterial network project.
- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban expansion due to population growth and poor health conditions caused by high population density within the city walls. After much public outcry, the walls were finally demolished in 1854, allowing for the city's territorial expansion. A competition was held for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias, but ultimately overruled in favor of Ildefons Cerdà's innovative plan. Cerdà's plan featured an orthogonal layout with wide streets, open spaces for gardens, and designated areas for public services and facilities. The buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan, and the distribution of the Eixample was divided into sectors, districts, and neighborhoods, each with their own designated public amenities. Although not all of Cerdà's plans were fully realized, his project had a significant impact on the development of Barcelona and was innovative for its time, particularly in its consideration of green spaces and service areas.
- The text describes the urban development of Barcelona with the aim to regenerate low-quality urban areas and decongest the city center. Twelve areas were delimited, including those related to the Olympic Games, and numerous roads and squares were improved. Sectoral plans were developed, and policies to promote affordable housing were implemented. The arrival of democracy led to the creation of new green areas, converting former industrial and municipal facilities into parks. The 1992 Olympic Games brought further transformation, including the remodeling of Montjuïc and the construction of the Olympic Village. The development also included the improvement of the sewerage system, the construction of breakwaters, and the recovery of the city's beaches.
- The text outlines the creation of 73 neighborhoods in Barcelona, which was a controversial process due to the division of some historical neighborhoods. The city has a long history, beginning with its founding by Roman colonizers as Barcino on a small hill near the coast with a natural harbor. The Romans built a walled city with a grid layout that would shape the city's future design. The city was a military stronghold and an important commercial center during the Middle Ages, becoming the capital of the Catalan counties and an influential maritime power in the Mediterranean. The Roman period left behind architectural elements such as walls, towers, a necropolis, and aqueducts, which have been preserved. The city's growth and development continued through various historical periods, with the Roman urban structure serving as the foundation for future growth.

- In the late 18th century, the Paseo Nuevo was created and the Born and Boqueria markets were established. The 19th century saw significant economic revitalization, particularly in the textile industry, leading to a Catalan cultural renaissance. The city walls were demolished between 1854 and 1859, allowing for urban expansion under the Eixample project. The Citadel was also demolished and transformed into a public park. Industrialization, led by the Bonaplata Factory and La España Industrial, brought about urban planning changes, including the regulation of building and public space maintenance. The first Municipal Ordinances were approved in 1856, and new ones were drawn up in 1891 to accommodate the Eixample plan. Key urban planning actions included the opening of Calle de Fernando and the expansion of the Pla de Palau.
- The Raval neighborhood, initially a suburb with orchards and religious buildings, required a new wall to be built in 1260 due to the creation of new neighborhoods. This new wall, 5100 m long and 1.5 km², had eighty towers and eight gates, including the Portal de l'Àngel, Portaferrissa, and La Boqueria. Additionally, a network of fortifications was constructed in the urban periphery for the city's defense. The medieval urban fabric was characterized by different areas of influence, with irregular streets and houses of the "artisan type." The first private urban planning operations took place in 1209 and 1355, with the opening of Montcada street and Plaça Nova. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Raval wall was constructed, leading to the urbanization of La Rambla and the creation of an extensive network of roads connecting the city to nearby suburbs and villages.
- In the 18th century, Barcelona underwent significant changes in urban planning, infrastructure, and architecture due to the installation of the Bourbon dynasty. The Nueva Planta Decree truncated Catalonia's autonomy, replacing the Generalitat, Corts, and Consell de Cent with a military government. Barcelona experienced a demographic increase and industrialization, leading to the Industrial Revolution. Military engineering projects, such as the castle of Montjuïc and the fortress of the Citadel, were constructed, causing the demolition of 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood, leaving 4500 people homeless. New military roads, the Mataró road and the Creu Coberta road, were also built.

The neighborhood of La Barceloneta was constructed in 1753, designed by the engineer Pedro Martín Cermeño, with a grid of orthogonal streets and blocks of houses. The Edicto de obreria was approved in 1771, controlling private works in the city, establishing the obligation to request a building permit, accompanied by a report and payment of fees, and setting a height limit for all buildings.

The redevelopment of La Rambla was carried out between 1776 and 1778, demolishing the inner wall, realigning buildings, and designing a new landscaped promenade. The paseos of Sant Joan and Gràcia were planned, and the street of the Count of the Assault was laid out in 1778-1789. The Born and Boqueria markets were established, and aspects such as weights and measures for the marketing of food products were regulated in 1752. The 19th century saw a great economic revitalization, primarily linked to the textile industry, leading to a Catalan cultural renaissance.
- Barcelona's urbanization was completed in 1444, with a wide space used for strolling and markets. The city's growth was limited in the Early Modern Age (15-18th centuries) due to becoming part of the Hispanic Monarchy, experiencing periods of prosperity and crisis. The city's walls remained unchanged, except for the addition of bastions. A port was built in the 15th century to accommodate maritime trade, and the seafront was later embanked. The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession.

The city's growth and development continued through various historical periods, with the Roman urban structure serving as the foundation for future growth.
- The Middle Ages marked the reuse and preservation of Roman Barcelona's urban structure as a military stronghold and county seat. The city became a significant maritime and commercial hub of the Mediterranean Sea, being part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona's growth led to the establishment of the Council of One Hundred for city administration, covering Montcada to Molins de Rei and Castelldefels to Montgat. The city had a Jewish quarter, the Call, from 692 until its destruction in 1391. Agricultural development occurred outside the city walls, and new neighborhoods formed around churches and monasteries, leading to a new wall construction in 1260.
- The Olympic Games in Barcelona required extensive urban planning and development. The coastal railroad was buried, sewage treatment plants were constructed, a new port and beaches were established, and road and transport axes were created. Large skyscrapers, such as Hotel Arts and Torre Mapfre, were built, and the Vall d'Hebron neighborhood was developed with green areas and sports facilities. New parks and gardens were also created, and the Old Port was remodeled for leisure purposes. The city's beaches were regenerated, and the Llobregat River was diverted to extend the port. The Raval neighborhood was remodeled, and new technological infrastructures, particularly in telecommunications, were built. The road infrastructure was significantly expanded, and the general planning was carried out by Josep Acebillo and Alfred Morales.
- Barcelona underwent significant transformation in transportation, infrastructure, and urban planning from the 1950s to 1970s. Three tunnels were proposed to cross the Collserola mountain range, but only one was built in two phases. The Rovira tunnel was also constructed. Streetcars were replaced by buses, and the metro network expanded, while trolleybuses appeared and then disappeared. The city's water supply was upgraded, and natural gas was introduced, along with improvements to electrical and telephone networks.

Major events and projects included the 1952 International Eucharistic Congress, which led to the development of the Congreso neighborhood, and the opening of the first section of the Paseo Marítimo in 1957. The Social Urgency Plan of 1958 addressed a housing deficit, resulting in large social housing blocks in peripheral neighborhoods. The Zona Franca industrial sector was established, and the Zona d'Actividades Logísticas was created in the 1990s.

Josep Maria de Porcioles served as mayor from 1957 to 1973, overseeing a period of urban speculation and rampant development. The Municipal Housing Board built large housing estates, such as Montbau, Southwest Besòs, and Canyelles. Although some urban development actions were positive, the speculative real estate operations caused popular discontent, leading to "urban social movements" that combined urban degradation frustration with political protest against the Franco regime.
- In 1925, Spain's telephone service was nationalized, leading to the creation of the Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. The number of telephones in Barcelona grew significantly from 2479 in 1897 to 850,000 in 2000. During the late 19th century, many supply markets were constructed, including those in Born, Sant Antoni, Hostafrancs, La Barceloneta, Concepción, Llibertat, Clot, Unió, Gràcia, and Sants. The 1888 Universal Exposition had a significant impact on the city, leading to improvements in infrastructure and modernization. The Citadel Park was remodeled, and the Salón de San Juan was renovated, featuring wrought iron balustrades, pavement mosaics, and large lampposts. Many of the buildings and pavilions constructed for the Exposition disappeared, but the Castle of the Three Dragons, the Martorell Museum, the Orangery, and the Umbraculum still remain. Numerous works and improvements were carried out throughout the city for the event, including the completion of the urbanization of the city's seafront, the beginning of the urbanization of Plaça de Catalunya, the covering of Riera d'en Malla, the beginning of Avenue of Paral·lel, and the extension of Passeig de Sant Joan. Additionally, Pere Garcia Fària's project to regulate the city's sewage system in 1891 established a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which is still in use today.

- The text describes four districts in Barcelona, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Horta-Guinardó, the oldest of the four, was once an agricultural area that became urbanized and industrialized in the early 1800s. It has a high population density and a large elderly population, with most residents being of lower-middle class. Nou Barris, the most recently created district, is located on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar and has a majority immigrant population that has suffered from real estate speculation and lack of assistance. Sant Andreu, which was once an agricultural and milling area, experienced industrialization in the mid-1800s and later received a wave of immigrant population. Sant Martí, another district that was once agricultural, underwent deindustrialization in recent decades and has seen an influx of new technology-based economic activities.

- Barcelona has 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods. The district of Ciutat Vella, the oldest part of the city, has the lowest socioeconomic level population and is the main tourist attraction due to its numerous monuments and ancient architecture. Eixample, which was built during the expansion of the old city, is a densely populated district and is known for its modernist architectural works and commercial activity. Sants-Montjuïc, the largest district, has a low population density, high percentage of green area, and includes the Montjuïc mountain and Zona Franca. Les Corts, originally an agricultural area, has a high rate of young people and middle class population, and is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, one of the largest districts, has the lowest population density and is a high status residential area with a predominance of single-family houses. Gràcia, with its high population density, has a high percentage of elderly people and lower-middle class population. Horta-Guinardó, originally an agricultural area and summer residences, has a low population density, young and lower-middle class population.

- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barcelona underwent significant urban development, including the installation of Golondrinas pleasure boats and the construction of a modern sewage system with a visitable network. The city's water supply was also expanded with the construction of a new pipeline and the creation of marketing companies. New hospitals, such as the Hospital Clínico y Provincial and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, were built to serve the growing population. The Eixample district was progressively urbanized through a management system involving both public and private participation. The 20th century brought political instability, with the end of the monarchy, the arrival of the Second Republic, the Civil War, Franco's dictatorship, and the reestablishment of the monarchy and democracy. During this time, Barcelona experienced massive immigration and population growth, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s before stabilizing at around 1.5 million inhabitants by the end of the century. The loss of colonies in America and Asia and the rise of regionalist politicians like Francesc Cambó, Enric Prat de la Riba, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch led to a desire to establish Barcelona as a major international city.

- In the early 1900s, Barcelona underwent significant urban development. A new road was built with a uniform noucentista design, influenced by the Chicago School, despite criticism and building demolitions. Other urbanization projects included the development of Tibidabo's slopes, the Can Muntaner estate, and the expansion of the port. The city also saw the introduction of the Barcelona Traction Light and Power company, leading to general electrification and industrial growth. Public urinals and a tramway network were established, followed by the appearance of the first bus lines. However, these bus lines faced opposition from tramway companies and were suspended, only to reappear later as suburban lines.
- In the 18th century, Barcelona underwent significant changes in urban planning, infrastructure, and architecture due to the installation of the Bourbon dynasty.

The Born and Boqueria markets were established, and aspects such as weights and measures for the marketing of food products were regulated in 1752. The 19th century saw a great economic revitalization, primarily linked to the textile industry, leading to a Catalan cultural renaissance.
- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant developments in transportation, urban planning, and public services. The city became a railway hub with stations like Francia (1854), Sants (1854), and Norte (1862), forming a network in the shape of a "Catalan eight." The first fire and police services were established, with the Guardia Urbana de Barcelona (1843) and the Sociedad de Extinción de Incendios y Salvamento de Barcelona (1865). The Diputation of Barcelona improved road layouts, such as Sarrià road (now Sarrià Avenue), and the telegraph service began in 1855. Public parks, like the General's Garden (1816), were created due to the Industrial Revolution's urban growth and environmental challenges. A major event was the demolition of the city walls in the mid-19th century, which paved the way for urban expansion (Eixample).

- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban expansion due to population growth and poor health conditions caused by high population density within the city walls. After much public outcry, the walls were finally demolished in 1854, allowing for the city's territorial expansion. A competition was held for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias, but ultimately overruled in favor of Ildefons Cerdà's innovative plan. Cerdà's plan featured an orthogonal layout with wide streets, open spaces for gardens, and designated areas for public services and facilities. The buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan, and the distribution of the Eixample was divided into sectors, districts, and neighborhoods, each with their own designated public amenities. Although not all of Cerdà's plans were fully realized, his project had a significant impact on the development of Barcelona and was innovative for its time, particularly in its consideration of green spaces and service areas.
- The Cerdà Plan, proposed in the mid-19th century, aimed to expand Barcelona with 16-meter tall buildings arranged in 20x20 block sectors, divided into districts and neighborhoods with specific facilities. The expansion was to be accompanied by better hygiene, circulation, and multipurpose design. However, due to opposition and real estate speculation, many of these plans were not realized. The city's interior also needed modernization, leading to plans like those of Miquel Garriga i Roca and Àngel Baixeras, which focused on realigning streets and creating major thoroughfares in the old city center.
- The growth of Barcelona's suburbs in the post-war period led to the concept of "Great Barcelona," with neighboring municipalities experiencing significant expansion due to real estate speculation, facilitated by the 1942 Municipal Ordinances reform. In 1945, Pedro Bidagor initiated the Regional Plan of 1953 to integrate the city and surroundings, addressing housing demand and speculation, and improving the urban environment. The Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956 aimed to rationalize urban development, while the Regional Plan zoned areas for growth, infrastructure, facilities, and green spaces, like the Collserola mountain range park.

Despite not being fully implemented, partial plans emerged, often catering to landowners' interests and increasing population density. New neighborhoods led to the construction of new markets and the improvement of the city's road network, including Meridiana Avenue, the First and Second Ring Roads, subway parking lots, and the 1962 arterial network project.
- During the dictatorship of Porcioles, the Municipal Housing Board developed large housing estates, but the speculative nature of real estate operations caused public discontent, leading to "urban social movements." The city saw some urban reorganization efforts, such as the Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1966) and Plan Barcelona 2000 (1970), as well as the approval of the Vilalta Plan for wastewater treatment in 1969. The Plan de la Ribera (1964-1972) aimed to urbanize the city's eastern seafront, but was halted due to opposition. Green space management focused on maintaining and restoring existing areas. With the end of the dictatorship and the start of democracy, new socialist councils prioritized urban planning and architecture, leading to extensive urban reforms culminating in the 1992 Olympic Games.
- The Macià Plan, proposed for Barcelona in the 1930s, suggested creating large residential modules with housing complexes and social facilities, along with green spaces and a leisure complex by the coast. Although not implemented, its innovative design influenced the city's urban planning during the democratic period, particularly in the recovery of the seafront for leisure. The GATCPAC, responsible for the plan, also developed a workers' housing project and a sanitation plan for the Old Town.

During Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975), uncontrolled housing construction took place to accommodate immigrants, leading to urban sprawl, cheap housing, and speculation. Housing was primarily built on the city's periphery using inexpensive materials, causing issues like aluminosis. This construction frenzy resulted in new neighborhoods and the uninterrupted connection with neighboring municipalities, coining the term "Great Barcelona." The 1942 Municipal Ordinances reform allowed increased building heights, further fueling real estate speculation.
- Barcelona underwent significant urban planning and development between 1989 and 2004. The planning was directed by Josep Acebillo, Alfred Morales, and Josep Emili Hernández-Cros, among others. Three ring roads were created, and a campaign to restore facades, monuments, and dividing walls, known as "Barcelona posa't guapa," was implemented. The 1992 Olympics served as a catalyst for strategic urban planning and led to the development of the "Barcelona model," an integrative urban reform project. The late 1990s saw a shift towards sustainable urban planning, with an emphasis on public spaces and community facilities. The use of bicycles as a more environmentally friendly means of transport was promoted, and the Bicing bicycle rental company was established in 2007. The Pla Director d'Infraestructures (Infrastructure Master Plan) marked the expansion and improvement of public transport. In the 21st century, the city continued to focus on innovation, design, new technologies, and environmental sustainability. The Urban Strategies Advisory Council was created, and the 22@ district was established in the El Poblenou neighborhood to promote new technology companies. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to further urban changes, including the regeneration of the Poblenou neighborhood and the creation of the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood.
- In the early 1900s, Barcelona underwent significant urban development. A new road was built with a uniform noucentista design, influenced by the Chicago School, despite criticism and building demolitions. Other urbanization projects included the development of Tibidabo's slopes, the Can Muntaner estate, and the expansion of the port. The city also saw the introduction of the Barcelona Traction Light and Power company, leading to general electrification and industrial growth. Public urinals and a tramway network were established, followed by the appearance of the first bus lines. However, these bus lines faced opposition from tramway companies and were suspended, only to reappear later as suburban lines.
- The text discusses the transformation of Barcelona's urban landscape and architectural panorama following the end of the dictatorship and the establishment of democracy. The new socialist councils under Narcís Serra and Pasqual Maragall focused on urban planning and architecture as key features of the city, leading to an extensive program of urban reforms culminating in the 1992 Olympic Games. The program included the acquisition of urban land, increased public facilities, and a shift towards industrial restructuring and new technologies.

The General Metropolitan Urban Development Plan was introduced in 1976 to curb speculation and rehabilitate degraded urban spaces, with a focus on social, welfare, and cultural facilities. The plan was divided into three main areas: small-scale urban rehabilitation, urban restructuring, and morphological reorganization. However, the plan faced numerous lawsuits and claims, leading to its dissolution in 1985. Despite this, its general guidelines have influenced urban planning actions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

The concept of "areas of new centrality" was developed between 1983 and 1989 to promote various sectors of the urban periphery and regenerate low-quality urban fabrics. Twelve areas were delimited, and numerous stretches of the city's roads were improved with wide and landscaped avenues designed for pedestrian traffic. The program focused on decongesting the city center and promoting urban regeneration in the peripheries.
- Barcelona's urbanization was completed in 1444, with a wide space used for strolling and markets. The city's growth was limited in the Early Modern Age (15-18th centuries) due to becoming part of the Hispanic Monarchy, experiencing periods of prosperity and crisis. The city's walls remained unchanged, except for the addition of bastions. A port was built in the 15th century to accommodate maritime trade, and the seafront was later embanked. The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession.
- The 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona led to significant urban development, including the urbanization of Montjuïc and the creation of gardens with a Mediterranean character. The event also prompted improvements in the city's infrastructure, such as the construction of public works, public transportation, and the installation of traffic lights. These developments resulted in increased immigration, leading to the growth of working-class neighborhoods and, unfortunately, the rise of shanty towns. The Second Republic's arrival and the grant of self-government to Catalonia further spurred urban development projects to address the city's infrastructure, housing, transportation, and facility needs.
- In the early 20th century, Barcelona underwent significant expansion, annexing several neighboring towns and growing from 15.5 km² to 77.8 km². This growth necessitated the development of infrastructure, transportation, and equipment to accommodate an increasingly industrialized society and a rising population. The French town planner Léon Jaussely won a 1903 competition to create a plan connecting the new municipalities to Barcelona and each other. Jaussely's plan, which was only partially realized, focused on a structural scheme with differentiated treatment of urban fabrics, a road system of main axes, zoning of activities, and systematization of green spaces. It included large road infrastructures, parks, rail links, public buildings, and facilities. The most significant action during this time was the opening of Via Laietana, which connected the Eixample with the sea. Criticism of the project led to the cancellation of two additional planned roads, but punctual interventions were made according to various projects throughout the century.

- Barcelona, the capital and largest city of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant on the Mediterranean coast, between 41°16' and 41°30' north latitude and 1°54' and 2°18' east longitude. The city is situated on a 102.16 km² plain, surrounded by the sea, the Collserola mountain range, and the deltas of the Besós and Llobregat rivers. Barcelona's climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and low rainfall. The city's terrain is hilly and was once covered in torrents and streams, which have since been replaced by built-up areas. Barcelona is the most significant urban center in Catalonia, serving as the seat of the autonomous government, the Parliament of Catalonia, and other important institutions. It is the second most populous city in Spain, with a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods, including the old core of the city and the Barceloneta neighborhood, which has seen significant immigration from both Spain and other countries.

The city's infrastructure was improved with the construction of gates, paved streets, sewers, and water fountains. However, Catalonia's autonomy was largely abolished in the 18th century after the War of Succession.
- In 1925, Spain's telephone service was nationalized, leading to the creation of the Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. The number of telephones in Barcelona grew significantly from 2479 in 1897 to 850,000 in 2000. During the late 19th century, many supply markets were constructed, including those in Born, Sant Antoni, Hostafrancs, La Barceloneta, Concepción, Llibertat, Clot, Unió, Gràcia, and Sants. The 1888 Universal Exposition had a significant impact on the city, leading to improvements in infrastructure and modernization. The Citadel Park was remodeled, and the Salón de San Juan was renovated, featuring wrought iron balustrades, pavement mosaics, and large lampposts. Many of the buildings and pavilions constructed for the Exposition disappeared, but the Castle of the Three Dragons, the Martorell Museum, the Orangery, and the Umbraculum still remain. Numerous works and improvements were carried out throughout the city for the event, including the completion of the urbanization of the city's seafront, the beginning of the urbanization of Plaça de Catalunya, the covering of Riera d'en Malla, the beginning of Avenue of Paral·lel, and the extension of Passeig de Sant Joan. Additionally, Pere Garcia Fària's project to regulate the city's sewage system in 1891 established a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which is still in use today.
- The Middle Ages marked the reuse and preservation of Roman Barcelona's urban structure as a military stronghold and county seat. The city became a significant maritime and commercial hub of the Mediterranean Sea, being part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona's growth led to the establishment of the Council of One Hundred for city administration, covering Montcada to Molins de Rei and Castelldefels to Montgat. The city had a Jewish quarter, the Call, from 692 until its destruction in 1391. Agricultural development occurred outside the city walls, and new neighborhoods formed around churches and monasteries, leading to a new wall construction in 1260.
- The text describes four districts in Barcelona, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Horta-Guinardó, the oldest of the four, was once an agricultural area that became urbanized and industrialized in the early 1800s. It has a high population density and a large elderly population, with most residents being of lower-middle class. Nou Barris, the most recently created district, is located on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar and has a majority immigrant population that has suffered from real estate speculation and lack of assistance. Sant Andreu, which was once an agricultural and milling area, experienced industrialization in the mid-1800s and later received a wave of immigrant population. Sant Martí, another district that was once agricultural, underwent deindustrialization in recent decades and has seen an influx of new technology-based economic activities.

Historically, Barcelona's administrative division has changed over time. The city was first divided into four quarters in 1389, with a grid system that separated the northern and southern quarters along the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This division highlighted the social differences between the different parts of the city. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, and in 1769, the city was reformed to create five quarters, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century for political reasons.

The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures led to the recovery of the Besòs area and the creation of new parks and leisure spaces. The urban planning of the new millennium has reinforced the grid structure, leading to the emergence of new urban centers and the improvement of communications, including the high-speed train, expanded port and airport, and an automated metro network. Pedestrian transit has been facilitated through elevators and escalators, and new green spaces have been created, such as the Central Park of Nou Barris and the Diagonal Mar Park. In 2015, the drafting of a new Urban Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona began, with objectives including classifying metropolitan land, establishing building regulations, and defining areas for sustainable development.
- The text outlines the creation of 73 neighborhoods in Barcelona, which was a controversial process due to the division of some historical neighborhoods. The city has a long history, beginning with its founding by Roman colonizers as Barcino on a small hill near the coast with a natural harbor. The Romans built a walled city with a grid layout that would shape the city's future design. The city was a military stronghold and an important commercial center during the Middle Ages, becoming the capital of the Catalan counties and an influential maritime power in the Mediterranean. The Roman period left behind architectural elements such as walls, towers, a necropolis, and aqueducts, which have been preserved. The city's growth and development continued through various historical periods, with the Roman urban structure serving as the foundation for future growth.

- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barcelona underwent significant urban development, including the installation of Golondrinas pleasure boats and the construction of a modern sewage system with a visitable network. The city's water supply was also expanded with the construction of a new pipeline and the creation of marketing companies. New hospitals, such as the Hospital Clínico y Provincial and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, were built to serve the growing population. The Eixample district was progressively urbanized through a management system involving both public and private participation. The 20th century brought political instability, with the end of the monarchy, the arrival of the Second Republic, the Civil War, Franco's dictatorship, and the reestablishment of the monarchy and democracy. During this time, Barcelona experienced massive immigration and population growth, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s before stabilizing at around 1.5 million inhabitants by the end of the century. The loss of colonies in America and Asia and the rise of regionalist politicians like Francesc Cambó, Enric Prat de la Riba, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch led to a desire to establish Barcelona as a major international city.

However, these bus lines faced opposition from tramway companies and were suspended, only to reappear later as suburban lines.
- In 1908, the service was abolished due to opposition from tramway companies, but it reappeared in 1916 with suburban lines. City buses were reintroduced in 1922 by the Compañía General de Autobuses de Barcelona, which later merged with Tranvías de Barcelona. The first taxis were licensed in 1910, and their numbers reached 1000 by 1920. The 1920s saw the introduction of the Barcelona Metro, with two lines becoming operational in 1924 and 1926. The city's public schooling expanded significantly during the early 20th century, and the idea of green spaces was proposed in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí. The 1929 International Exposition was held in Montjuïc, leading to the urbanization of the area and the construction of pavilions.
- In the mid to late 1800s, there were several urban development projects in Barcelona. One of the first was by Miquel Garriga i Roca in 1862, which proposed realigning streets for a broad renovation of the city's interior. However, it was not executed due to difficulties and lack of expropriation mechanisms. Àngel Baixeras presented a more elaborate project in 1878, which included opening three major thoroughfares and was approved in 1879, but not executed until 1908. The tramway was introduced in 1860 and electrified in 1899. Street furniture also grew, especially during the appointment of Antoni Rovira i Trias and his successor Pere Falqués. Electric lighting began in the 1880s and was generalized by the beginning of the 20th century. The first telephone communication in the peninsula took place in Barcelona in 1877, and the number of telephones grew progressively throughout the century. Additionally, numerous supply markets were built, many made of iron.
- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant developments in transportation, urban planning, and public services. The city became a railway hub with stations like Francia (1854), Sants (1854), and Norte (1862), forming a network in the shape of a "Catalan eight." The first fire and police services were established, with the Guardia Urbana de Barcelona (1843) and the Sociedad de Extinción de Incendios y Salvamento de Barcelona (1865). The Diputation of Barcelona improved road layouts, such as Sarrià road (now Sarrià Avenue), and the telegraph service began in 1855. Public parks, like the General's Garden (1816), were created due to the Industrial Revolution's urban growth and environmental challenges. A major event was the demolition of the city walls in the mid-19th century, which paved the way for urban expansion (Eixample).
- Barcelona underwent significant transformation in transportation, infrastructure, and urban planning from the 1950s to 1970s. Three tunnels were proposed to cross the Collserola mountain range, but only one was built in two phases. The Rovira tunnel was also constructed. Streetcars were replaced by buses, and the metro network expanded, while trolleybuses appeared and then disappeared. The city's water supply was upgraded, and natural gas was introduced, along with improvements to electrical and telephone networks.

Major events and projects included the 1952 International Eucharistic Congress, which led to the development of the Congreso neighborhood, and the opening of the first section of the Paseo Marítimo in 1957. The Social Urgency Plan of 1958 addressed a housing deficit, resulting in large social housing blocks in peripheral neighborhoods. The Zona Franca industrial sector was established, and the Zona d'Actividades Logísticas was created in the 1990s.

Josep Maria de Porcioles served as mayor from 1957 to 1973, overseeing a period of urban speculation and rampant development. The Municipal Housing Board built large housing estates, such as Montbau, Southwest Besòs, and Canyelles. Although some urban development actions were positive, the speculative real estate operations caused popular discontent, leading to "urban social movements" that combined urban degradation frustration with political protest against the Franco regime.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barcelona underwent significant urban development, including the installation of Golondrinas pleasure boats and the construction of a modern sewage system with a visitable network. The city's water supply was also expanded with the construction of a new pipeline and the creation of marketing companies. New hospitals, such as the Hospital Clínico y Provincial and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, were built to serve the growing population. The Eixample district was progressively urbanized through a management system involving both public and private participation. The 20th century brought political instability, with the end of the monarchy, the arrival of the Second Republic, the Civil War, Franco's dictatorship, and the reestablishment of the monarchy and democracy. During this time, Barcelona experienced massive immigration and population growth, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s before stabilizing at around 1.5 million inhabitants by the end of the century. The loss of colonies in America and Asia and the rise of regionalist politicians like Francesc Cambó, Enric Prat de la Riba, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch led to a desire to establish Barcelona as a major international city.
- In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban planning changes due to the obsolescence of previous ordinances. New ordinances were established in 1891, taking into account the Eixample plan and increasing the area of plot occupation to 70%. Key urban actions included the opening of Calle de Fernando, Pla de Palau expansion, and the creation of new public spaces such as La Boqueria and Santa Catalina markets, Gran Teatro del Liceo, and Plaça Reial. New sanitary provisions led to the disappearance of parish cemeteries and the establishment of new cemeteries outside the city.

In 1842, gas lighting was introduced, starting with La Rambla, Fernando Street, and Plaza de San Jaime. The Sociedad Catalana para el Alumbrado por Gas was established, later renamed as Catalana de Gas y Electricidad. Gas was successfully applied to domestic stoves and heaters in 1856.

The arrival of the railroad in 1848 marked a significant milestone in Barcelona's development as a metropolitan capital. The city became the center of a railway network in the shape of an 8, with links to France, Madrid, Zaragoza, Valencia, and other Catalan provincial capitals. The first fire and police services, Guardia Urbana de Barcelona, were established in 1843, responsible for public safety and, since 1938, traffic and urban circulation.
- The 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona led to significant urban development, including the urbanization of Montjuïc and the creation of gardens with a Mediterranean character. The event also prompted improvements in the city's infrastructure, such as the construction of public works, public transportation, and the installation of traffic lights. These developments resulted in increased immigration, leading to the growth of working-class neighborhoods and, unfortunately, the rise of shanty towns. The Second Republic's arrival and the grant of self-government to Catalonia further spurred urban development projects to address the city's infrastructure, housing, transportation, and facility needs.
- In the early 20th century, Barcelona underwent significant expansion, annexing several neighboring towns and growing from 15.5 km² to 77.8 km². This growth necessitated the development of infrastructure, transportation, and equipment to accommodate an increasingly industrialized society and a rising population. The French town planner Léon Jaussely won a 1903 competition to create a plan connecting the new municipalities to Barcelona and each other. Jaussely's plan, which was only partially realized, focused on a structural scheme with differentiated treatment of urban fabrics, a road system of main axes, zoning of activities, and systematization of green spaces. It included large road infrastructures, parks, rail links, public buildings, and facilities. The most significant action during this time was the opening of Via Laietana, which connected the Eixample with the sea. Criticism of the project led to the cancellation of two additional planned roads, but punctual interventions were made according to various projects throughout the century.

- Over several decades, French governments have attempted pension reforms to address budget shortfalls, as France has a low retirement age and spends a high percentage of GDP on pensions. The current system, based on mandatory payroll taxes funding retiree pensions, will not change. However, rising life expectancy has left the system precarious, with fewer workers supporting each retiree. Macron's proposed reforms include gradually raising the retirement age to 64 by 2030, increasing years of contributions for a full pension, and eliminating special rules for certain sectors. These reforms aim to balance the pension deficit by 2030, creating a surplus to cover early retirement for physically demanding jobs. Initial protests and strikes have occurred, and the government has signaled flexibility regarding the retirement age increase.
- The left-wing coalition NUPES and some French deputies argue that a pension reform, included in the social security budget, is unconstitutional as it addresses more than just finances. They plan to use the Conseil d'État's warning to the government about the reform's potential unconstitutionality. In March, President Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms, and the state visit of King Charles III was postponed due to ongoing protests. The cancellation was met with mixed reactions in France, while international reactions included criticism from Iran and human rights organizations accusing French authorities of excessive force and violating protestors' rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities to protect peaceful demonstrations.
- Protests in France over Macron's proposed pension reforms have resulted in injuries to both protesters and police. The use of excessive force by authorities has been criticized by the Council of Europe. The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is similar to former President Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which led to widespread protests and influenced the 2012 presidential election. Invoking Article 49.3 could be perceived as brutal and erode support for the government and democratic institutions. Alternatives to the pension reforms include firing the Prime Minister, holding a referendum, or triggering a 'RIP' before the enactment of the law. However, these options have their own requirements and potential consequences. Macron has stated that he will not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. The planned state visit of King Charles III to France has been postponed due to the ongoing protests.
- Protests against the French government's pension reform have resulted in injuries to police officers and protesters, property damage, and arrests. The Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide and over 80 people were arrested. Union leaders and politicians have criticized the violence and called for non-violence. The French government has estimated 740,000 attendees at the protests, while unions claim 2 million. After the Constitutional Council declared the pension bill compatible with the Constitution, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to address anger over the reform in the next 100 days and take measures to improve work, law and order, education, and health conditions. Protesters have continued to gather and express their opposition to the pension reform, including threatening to cancel the 2024 Summer Olympics if the reform is not withdrawn.
- Paris's mayor supports a strike, and the government threatens to intervene if she doesn't comply. The French government, led by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, invoked Article 49.3 of the constitution to enact pension reforms without a parliamentary vote, causing protests and political backlash. Opposition MPs sang the national anthem and denounced the move, with some filing no-confidence motions. Politicians from various parties criticized the government, and protesters rallied in Paris and other cities, leading to clashes with police, arrests, and property damage. The CGT union announced further strikes and demonstrations, describing the government's move as undemocratic and disrespectful.
- In January 2023, French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne indicated flexibility on raising the retirement age to 65, aiming to balance the pension system by 2030 through other solutions. The policy was to be presented in late January, debated in parliament in February, and implemented despite significant opposition. The use of Article 49.3, a constitutional measure allowing the government to pass bills without a vote, was considered but initially dismissed due to being widely condemned as undemocratic. However, on March 16, President Emmanuel Macron invoked Article 49.3 to avoid a likely defeat in the National Assembly vote.

This decision highlighted Macron's parliamentary struggles, as his party had lost its majority in the National Assembly following the 2022 legislative election. The move was met with criticism from trade unions and the public, resulting in a wave of strikes and protests. Polls showed that the majority of the population opposed the use of Article 49.3, including many who had voted for Macron in the previous presidential election.

The reforms have been criticized for disproportionately affecting women and the working class. Women, who typically retire later and receive lower pensions, would be required to work even longer under the new reforms. Similarly, those in manual labor jobs, who often start their careers early, would be penalized by the changes. The government's use of Article 49.3 has been perceived as a sign of weakness and a brutal approach to implementing unpopular policies, leading to a decline in Macron's approval ratings.
- Olivier Gantois, head of UFIP, believes fuel shortages are caused by panic buying, while protests erupted in Paris, with citizens chanting for the French President's resignation. Violence was attributed to groups of 300 moving quickly through the capital, resulting in 234 arrests. Protests also occurred in other cities, with varying levels of violence. Unions and opposition parties aim to increase protests to force a change in the pension reforms. Prime Minister Borne submitted the new law to France's Constitutional Council for review, aiming to accelerate the process. Macron announced he won't withdraw or change the pension reforms, but will use a TV interview to calm tensions and prepare for future reforms. There is unease within parties aligned with Macron regarding his response to the protests and strikes.
- In a survey from 9-16 March, a large majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with a certain individual, with only a small percentage expressing satisfaction. Critics argue that proposed reforms disproportionately affect women, who typically retire later and with lower pensions due to part-time work and maternity leave. The reforms are also said to disproportionately impact the working class and those in manual labor jobs. Some are concerned about being forced to work beyond the retirement age due to age discrimination in the labor market. Opponents argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and the wealthy over average workers and disputes the need for urgency. Critics also take issue with the timing of the reforms during a cost-of-living crisis. The protests against the reforms have been marked by instances of violence, rioting, and looting. The unrest has been attributed in part to the unpopularity of the individual associated with the reforms. The methods used in some of the protests, such as the destruction of union property and the presence of black bloc groups, have also been criticized. The protests and unrest occurred prior to the use of a certain parliamentary procedure to pass the reforms.
- Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt have stated that they have devoted significant time to dialogue regarding the pension bill, and plan to involve the public and unions more in future legislation. However, they did not provide details on how this would be achieved. Meanwhile, President Macron is facing unease within his aligned parties due to ongoing violent protests and strikes, which represent the most significant challenge to his authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt. Macron is planning to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and prepare for further reforms.

There have been significant disruptions to transportation and other services due to strikes and protests. Authorities have asked airlines to cancel 20% of their flights, and there have been cancellations at Air France. Oil terminals and refineries have been blocked by strikers, leading to shortages at gas stations in southeastern France. The government has ordered rubbish collectors back to work in Paris to ensure a minimum service.

Students have also been involved in protests, blockading universities and setting skips alight during protests. Macron gave a televised interview on 22 March, where he was questioned by journalists from TF1 and France 2.
- Unions have been organizing recurring strikes across France since January 19, with the largest protests attracting up to 1.4 million people. The strikes have caused disruptions in transportation, including the cancellation of flights and trains. Union members have also blocked fuel deliveries in an attempt to halt the French economy. The protests were in response to the government's plan to reform the pension system, which would raise the retirement age. The government eventually enacted the reforms without a parliamentary vote, invoking Article 49:3 of the constitution, which led to protests and jeering inside the National Assembly. There were conflicting reports on the number of protesters, with estimates ranging from 37,000 to 450,000 in Paris alone. The protests were coordinated by eight trade unions and affected various sectors, including transportation, education, and energy. The police had to intervene in some cities to control violence and clear out garbage that had accumulated due to the strike by garbage collectors. The government threatened to force some of the garbage workers to return to work, citing public health concerns.

- Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.
- Unionists and strikers protested at several locations in France, including Gare de Lyon train station and Charles de Gaulle Airport, causing disruptions to transportation and exams. Workers at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk reduced output, and oil refinery and depot blockades led to fuel shortages. Protests also occurred at major tourist attractions and universities, with varying numbers of demonstrators reported. While most protests were peaceful, there were instances of violence in Paris, where riot police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse protesters. The protests were due to anger over pension reforms and Macron's comments, with demonstrators demanding a return to the retirement age of 60.

- Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations. There have also been reports of threatening emails and vandalism targeting the offices of certain political parties.
- The French police have been accused of using excessive force, making preventative arrests, and assaulting journalists during protests, according to various human rights groups, the French Defender of Rights, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association. The Council of Europe has condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned against excessive use of force by state agents. The White House and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece have expressed support for the right to protest in France. A rally in Paris saw the International Anthem played, and the General Secretary was given a "Friends of the Paris Commune" handkerchief.
- After protests in France, many people were arrested, with some being taken into custody without a clear reason. This has led to concerns about "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate." The police have been accused of using mass arrests to suppress the protest movement. The use of criminal law to discourage demonstrators is reportedly unprecedented. The police have also been accused of using excessive force and disproportionately targeting young women. The protests were sparked by a proposed increase in the retirement age. This proposal has been compared to a similar reform in 2010, which led to widespread protests and was seen as a factor in the subsequent election. There are concerns that the current protests could have political ramifications, similar to those seen in 2010.
- On March 18 and 19, protests and strikes occurred in several French cities, including Nantes, Marseille, Montpellier, Besançon, Lyon, and Paris, in response to the government's pension reform plan.

The leader of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, announced that his party would not back the no-confidence motions, making it unlikely for them to pass. NUPES' Jean-Luc Mélenchon urged protesters to avoid violence and keep up their struggle until the 64-year pension reform is off the table. National Rally president Jordan Bardella attempted to persuade more Republican MPs to follow Ciotti's decision by promising not to put up candidates against them in case of an election.
- On April 17, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a plan to address anger over pension reform and other issues within 100 days. However, unions rejected his invitation to meet and called for mass protests on May 1, International Workers Day. Protests occurred throughout Macron's tour of France, with protesters demanding the withdrawal of the pension reform and jeering at the president. On May 1, clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in injuries and arrests, as well as property damage in several cities. On May 2, unions announced another day of nationwide protests on June 6. The government expressed its desire to move on to other issues and proposed talks with unions to discuss workers' conditions. Meanwhile, protests and clashes continued, with authorities responding with tear gas and arrests. Concerns over increasing violence have been raised. The Constitutional Council rejected a second bid for a pension referendum, and protests ensued. Hospital workers protested in front of Carlton Cannes Hotel, violating a ban on protests, and dozens of protesters gathered in Gannes during the Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, and strikes forced Orly Airport to cancel one-third of its flights. Protesters also briefly occupied the headquarters building of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. A total of 11,000 law enforcement officers were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris.

- Protests in France over Macron's proposed pension reforms have resulted in injuries to both protesters and police. The use of excessive force by authorities has been criticized by the Council of Europe. The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is similar to former President Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which led to widespread protests and influenced the 2012 presidential election. Invoking Article 49.3 could be perceived as brutal and erode support for the government and democratic institutions. Alternatives to the pension reforms include firing the Prime Minister, holding a referendum, or triggering a 'RIP' before the enactment of the law. However, these options have their own requirements and potential consequences. Macron has stated that he will not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. The planned state visit of King Charles III to France has been postponed due to the ongoing protests.
- The left-wing coalition NUPES and some French deputies argue that a pension reform, included in the social security budget, is unconstitutional as it addresses more than just finances. They plan to use the Conseil d'État's warning to the government about the reform's potential unconstitutionality. In March, President Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms, and the state visit of King Charles III was postponed due to ongoing protests. The cancellation was met with mixed reactions in France, while international reactions included criticism from Iran and human rights organizations accusing French authorities of excessive force and violating protestors' rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities to protect peaceful demonstrations.
- Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt have stated that they have devoted significant time to dialogue regarding the pension bill, and plan to involve the public and unions more in future legislation. However, they did not provide details on how this would be achieved. Meanwhile, President Macron is facing unease within his aligned parties due to ongoing violent protests and strikes, which represent the most significant challenge to his authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt. Macron is planning to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and prepare for further reforms.

There have been significant disruptions to transportation and other services due to strikes and protests. Authorities have asked airlines to cancel 20% of their flights, and there have been cancellations at Air France. Oil terminals and refineries have been blocked by strikers, leading to shortages at gas stations in southeastern France. The government has ordered rubbish collectors back to work in Paris to ensure a minimum service.

Students have also been involved in protests, blockading universities and setting skips alight during protests. Macron gave a televised interview on 22 March, where he was questioned by journalists from TF1 and France 2.
- Protests against the French government's pension reform have resulted in injuries to police officers and protesters, property damage, and arrests. The Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide and over 80 people were arrested. Union leaders and politicians have criticized the violence and called for non-violence. The French government has estimated 740,000 attendees at the protests, while unions claim 2 million. After the Constitutional Council declared the pension bill compatible with the Constitution, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to address anger over the reform in the next 100 days and take measures to improve work, law and order, education, and health conditions. Protesters have continued to gather and express their opposition to the pension reform, including threatening to cancel the 2024 Summer Olympics if the reform is not withdrawn.
- In a survey from 9-16 March, a large majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with a certain individual, with only a small percentage expressing satisfaction. Critics argue that proposed reforms disproportionately affect women, who typically retire later and with lower pensions due to part-time work and maternity leave. The reforms are also said to disproportionately impact the working class and those in manual labor jobs. Some are concerned about being forced to work beyond the retirement age due to age discrimination in the labor market. Opponents argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and the wealthy over average workers and disputes the need for urgency. Critics also take issue with the timing of the reforms during a cost-of-living crisis. The protests against the reforms have been marked by instances of violence, rioting, and looting. The unrest has been attributed in part to the unpopularity of the individual associated with the reforms. The methods used in some of the protests, such as the destruction of union property and the presence of black bloc groups, have also been criticized. The protests and unrest occurred prior to the use of a certain parliamentary procedure to pass the reforms.
- Olivier Gantois, head of UFIP, believes fuel shortages are caused by panic buying, while protests erupted in Paris, with citizens chanting for the French President's resignation. Violence was attributed to groups of 300 moving quickly through the capital, resulting in 234 arrests. Protests also occurred in other cities, with varying levels of violence. Unions and opposition parties aim to increase protests to force a change in the pension reforms. Prime Minister Borne submitted the new law to France's Constitutional Council for review, aiming to accelerate the process. Macron announced he won't withdraw or change the pension reforms, but will use a TV interview to calm tensions and prepare for future reforms. There is unease within parties aligned with Macron regarding his response to the protests and strikes.
- In January 2023, French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne indicated flexibility on raising the retirement age to 65, aiming to balance the pension system by 2030 through other solutions. The policy was to be presented in late January, debated in parliament in February, and implemented despite significant opposition. The use of Article 49.3, a constitutional measure allowing the government to pass bills without a vote, was considered but initially dismissed due to being widely condemned as undemocratic. However, on March 16, President Emmanuel Macron invoked Article 49.3 to avoid a likely defeat in the National Assembly vote.

This decision highlighted Macron's parliamentary struggles, as his party had lost its majority in the National Assembly following the 2022 legislative election. The move was met with criticism from trade unions and the public, resulting in a wave of strikes and protests. Polls showed that the majority of the population opposed the use of Article 49.3, including many who had voted for Macron in the previous presidential election.

The reforms have been criticized for disproportionately affecting women and the working class. Women, who typically retire later and receive lower pensions, would be required to work even longer under the new reforms. Similarly, those in manual labor jobs, who often start their careers early, would be penalized by the changes. The government's use of Article 49.3 has been perceived as a sign of weakness and a brutal approach to implementing unpopular policies, leading to a decline in Macron's approval ratings.
- Art students in Paris protested against the proposed increase in retirement age by building a barricade outside their school and carrying signs threatening a new May 1968. In Rennes, skips were set on fire during a protest. Macron, in a televised interview, defended the necessity of the reform despite its unpopularity and condemned the violence that had occurred during protests. Union leaders criticized Macron's interview, with Philippe Martinez of the CGT calling for more people to strike and Laurent Berger of the CFDT accusing Macron of lying about unions not offering an alternative. Marine Le Pen refused to help Macron resolve the crisis, accusing him of disdain for workers and insulting protesters. Fuel shortages were reported in several parts of the country due to oil refinery blockades. Unions announced another day of strikes and demonstrations for 23 March, with the largest protest expected in Paris. Public transport was severely impacted, with only two Paris metro lines running normally and many flights cancelled in Paris Orly Airport. Primary and middle school teachers' strike participation was estimated to be around 24%, with stronger walkouts in certain departments.
- On April 17, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a plan to address anger over pension reform and other issues within 100 days. However, unions rejected his invitation to meet and called for mass protests on May 1, International Workers Day. Protests occurred throughout Macron's tour of France, with protesters demanding the withdrawal of the pension reform and jeering at the president. On May 1, clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in injuries and arrests, as well as property damage in several cities. On May 2, unions announced another day of nationwide protests on June 6. The government expressed its desire to move on to other issues and proposed talks with unions to discuss workers' conditions. Meanwhile, protests and clashes continued, with authorities responding with tear gas and arrests. Concerns over increasing violence have been raised. The Constitutional Council rejected a second bid for a pension referendum, and protests ensued. Hospital workers protested in front of Carlton Cannes Hotel, violating a ban on protests, and dozens of protesters gathered in Gannes during the Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, and strikes forced Orly Airport to cancel one-third of its flights. Protesters also briefly occupied the headquarters building of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. A total of 11,000 law enforcement officers were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris.
- Over several decades, French governments have attempted pension reforms to address budget shortfalls, as France has a low retirement age and spends a high percentage of GDP on pensions. The current system, based on mandatory payroll taxes funding retiree pensions, will not change. However, rising life expectancy has left the system precarious, with fewer workers supporting each retiree. Macron's proposed reforms include gradually raising the retirement age to 64 by 2030, increasing years of contributions for a full pension, and eliminating special rules for certain sectors. These reforms aim to balance the pension deficit by 2030, creating a surplus to cover early retirement for physically demanding jobs. Initial protests and strikes have occurred, and the government has signaled flexibility regarding the retirement age increase.

- Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations. There have also been reports of threatening emails and vandalism targeting the offices of certain political parties.
- Protests against the French government's pension reform have resulted in injuries to police officers and protesters, property damage, and arrests. The Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide and over 80 people were arrested. Union leaders and politicians have criticized the violence and called for non-violence. The French government has estimated 740,000 attendees at the protests, while unions claim 2 million. After the Constitutional Council declared the pension bill compatible with the Constitution, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to address anger over the reform in the next 100 days and take measures to improve work, law and order, education, and health conditions. Protesters have continued to gather and express their opposition to the pension reform, including threatening to cancel the 2024 Summer Olympics if the reform is not withdrawn.
- In January, large-scale protests over proposed pension reforms took place in France, with over a million people demonstrating nationwide. The reforms, which included raising the retirement age and increasing annual pension contributions, were met with resistance from eight major unions. Despite the protests, the French government, led by President Emmanuel Macron, emphasized that the reforms would proceed. Further strikes and protests were announced for January 31, with public transportation, schools, and electricity production targeted. The CGT union reported 2.8 million protesters, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs counted 1.272 million. National protests continued in February, with a third day of protests on February 7 and a fourth day on February 11, with the CGT reporting over 2.5 million protesters and the Ministry of the Interior claiming 963,000. Protests and strikes continued in early March, with trains and fuel deliveries affected, and over 1.1 to 1.4 million people participating in protests across the country. The Intersyndicale called for recurring strikes starting on March 7.
- After protests in France, many people were arrested, with some being taken into custody without a clear reason. This has led to concerns about "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate." The police have been accused of using mass arrests to suppress the protest movement. The use of criminal law to discourage demonstrators is reportedly unprecedented. The police have also been accused of using excessive force and disproportionately targeting young women. The protests were sparked by a proposed increase in the retirement age. This proposal has been compared to a similar reform in 2010, which led to widespread protests and was seen as a factor in the subsequent election. There are concerns that the current protests could have political ramifications, similar to those seen in 2010.
- Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.
- On March 18, protests and blockades occurred across France, led by various unions including CGT and SNCF, in response to the government's push for pension changes. Protesters disrupted train stations in Bordeaux, Donges, Valenciennes, and Marseille, while striking rubbish collectors clashed with police in Ivry-sur-Seine. No-confidence motions were tabled in the National Assembly by centrist group Liot and National Rally. Interior Minister warned against chaos and violence, while police banned protests in Place de la Concorde and Champs-Élysées, leading to clashes and arrests in Paris, with 122 arrested in Paris and 169 nationwide. Protests also took place in Marseille, Nantes, Brest, Montpellier, and other cities, with some demonstrations turning violent. TotalEnergies reported that 37% of its operational staff at refineries and depots were on strike, and rolling strikes continued on railways.
- On March 18 and 19, protests and strikes occurred in several French cities, including Nantes, Marseille, Montpellier, Besançon, Lyon, and Paris, in response to the government's pension reform plan. Some protests turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police, lighting bonfires, and occupying buildings. Union leaders anticipated that some airports would see up to a third of flights cancelled on March 20 due to strike action. easyJet and Ryanair warned passengers of potential disruptions. Union activists marched through shopping malls, and cars were allowed to pass through tolls on motorways for free. Refineries were shut down, leading to petrol queues in the south of France, although authorities claimed supplies were sufficient to avoid shortages. Waste collection in some Paris neighborhoods was disrupted, and the CGT union urged workers to continue their strike. The government threatened to order striking workers to return to work to prevent fuel shortages. The DGAC requested 30% of flights at Orly Airport and 20% in Marseille to be cancelled on March 20. Meanwhile, Macron called for support for legislators and protection for their offices, and made a public statement expressing hope that the pension reform bill would complete its democratic journey with respect for all. The leader of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, announced that his party would not back the no-confidence motions, making it unlikely for them to pass. NUPES' Jean-Luc Mélenchon urged protesters to avoid violence and keep up their struggle until the 64-year pension reform is off the table. National Rally president Jordan Bardella attempted to persuade more Republican MPs to follow Ciotti's decision by promising not to put up candidates against them in case of an election.
- Unionists and strikers protested at several locations in France, including Gare de Lyon train station and Charles de Gaulle Airport, causing disruptions to transportation and exams. Workers at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk reduced output, and oil refinery and depot blockades led to fuel shortages. Protests also occurred at major tourist attractions and universities, with varying numbers of demonstrators reported. While most protests were peaceful, there were instances of violence in Paris, where riot police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse protesters. The protests were due to anger over pension reforms and Macron's comments, with demonstrators demanding a return to the retirement age of 60.

- The leader of the CGT union, Berger, cautioned the government that protests in France could turn more violent if demonstrators believe the Yellow Vests have achieved greater results through violence than peaceful mass demonstrations by established unions. Waste collectors in Paris initiated a strike on March 6, which expanded to include blockades of the city's incinerators, causing thousands of tonnes of rubbish to accumulate on the streets. Despite efforts by the government to end the strike, Paris's mayor, Hidalgo, has expressed her support for the strikers. The waste collection strike also impacted other cities, including Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre. Police have requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods, and many of those arrested during the protests were later released without charge.

Unions described the passing of the law as undemocratic and called for further strikes and demonstrations. In Paris, over 300 people were arrested in relation to the protests. President Macron made no public comments on the matter, but reportedly expressed concern about the impact on the country's future. Protesters called for Macron's resignation and targeted symbols of wealth and power. The CGT union announced escalated strikes, including the disruption of Paris's Boulevard Périphérique and blockades at refineries and other industrial sites. Smaller protests and rallies took place in several other cities, with various forms of property damage and disruptions reported. Students also protested near Sorbonne University and at the Institute of Political Studies in Lille.
- Unions have been organizing recurring strikes across France since January 19, with the largest protests attracting up to 1.4 million people. The strikes have caused disruptions in transportation, including the cancellation of flights and trains. Union members have also blocked fuel deliveries in an attempt to halt the French economy. The protests were in response to the government's plan to reform the pension system, which would raise the retirement age. The government eventually enacted the reforms without a parliamentary vote, invoking Article 49:3 of the constitution, which led to protests and jeering inside the National Assembly. There were conflicting reports on the number of protesters, with estimates ranging from 37,000 to 450,000 in Paris alone. The protests were coordinated by eight trade unions and affected various sectors, including transportation, education, and energy. The police had to intervene in some cities to control violence and clear out garbage that had accumulated due to the strike by garbage collectors. The government threatened to force some of the garbage workers to return to work, citing public health concerns.
- Unionists and strikers protested at several locations in France, including Gare de Lyon train station and Charles de Gaulle Airport, causing disruptions to transportation and exams. Workers at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk reduced output, and oil refinery and depot blockades led to fuel shortages. Protests also occurred at major tourist attractions and universities, with varying numbers of demonstrators reported. While most protests were peaceful, there were instances of violence in Paris, where riot police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse protesters. The protests were due to anger over pension reforms and Macron's comments, with demonstrators demanding a return to the retirement age of 60.
- Art students in Paris protested against the proposed increase in retirement age by building a barricade outside their school and carrying signs threatening a new May 1968. In Rennes, skips were set on fire during a protest. Macron, in a televised interview, defended the necessity of the reform despite its unpopularity and condemned the violence that had occurred during protests. Union leaders criticized Macron's interview, with Philippe Martinez of the CGT calling for more people to strike and Laurent Berger of the CFDT accusing Macron of lying about unions not offering an alternative. Marine Le Pen refused to help Macron resolve the crisis, accusing him of disdain for workers and insulting protesters. Fuel shortages were reported in several parts of the country due to oil refinery blockades. Unions announced another day of strikes and demonstrations for 23 March, with the largest protest expected in Paris. Public transport was severely impacted, with only two Paris metro lines running normally and many flights cancelled in Paris Orly Airport. Primary and middle school teachers' strike participation was estimated to be around 24%, with stronger walkouts in certain departments.
- In January, large-scale protests over proposed pension reforms took place in France, with over a million people demonstrating nationwide. The reforms, which included raising the retirement age and increasing annual pension contributions, were met with resistance from eight major unions. Despite the protests, the French government, led by President Emmanuel Macron, emphasized that the reforms would proceed. Further strikes and protests were announced for January 31, with public transportation, schools, and electricity production targeted. The CGT union reported 2.8 million protesters, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs counted 1.272 million. National protests continued in February, with a third day of protests on February 7 and a fourth day on February 11, with the CGT reporting over 2.5 million protesters and the Ministry of the Interior claiming 963,000. Protests and strikes continued in early March, with trains and fuel deliveries affected, and over 1.1 to 1.4 million people participating in protests across the country. The Intersyndicale called for recurring strikes starting on March 7.
- Protests against the French government's pension reform have resulted in injuries to police officers and protesters, property damage, and arrests. The Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide and over 80 people were arrested. Union leaders and politicians have criticized the violence and called for non-violence. The French government has estimated 740,000 attendees at the protests, while unions claim 2 million. After the Constitutional Council declared the pension bill compatible with the Constitution, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to address anger over the reform in the next 100 days and take measures to improve work, law and order, education, and health conditions. Protesters have continued to gather and express their opposition to the pension reform, including threatening to cancel the 2024 Summer Olympics if the reform is not withdrawn.

- Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations. There have also been reports of threatening emails and vandalism targeting the offices of certain political parties.
- On April 17, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a plan to address anger over pension reform and other issues within 100 days. However, unions rejected his invitation to meet and called for mass protests on May 1, International Workers Day. Protests occurred throughout Macron's tour of France, with protesters demanding the withdrawal of the pension reform and jeering at the president. On May 1, clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in injuries and arrests, as well as property damage in several cities. On May 2, unions announced another day of nationwide protests on June 6. The government expressed its desire to move on to other issues and proposed talks with unions to discuss workers' conditions. Meanwhile, protests and clashes continued, with authorities responding with tear gas and arrests. Concerns over increasing violence have been raised. The Constitutional Council rejected a second bid for a pension referendum, and protests ensued. Hospital workers protested in front of Carlton Cannes Hotel, violating a ban on protests, and dozens of protesters gathered in Gannes during the Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, and strikes forced Orly Airport to cancel one-third of its flights. Protesters also briefly occupied the headquarters building of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. A total of 11,000 law enforcement officers were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris.
- Unionists and strikers protested at several locations in France, including Gare de Lyon train station and Charles de Gaulle Airport, causing disruptions to transportation and exams. Workers at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk reduced output, and oil refinery and depot blockades led to fuel shortages. Protests also occurred at major tourist attractions and universities, with varying numbers of demonstrators reported. While most protests were peaceful, there were instances of violence in Paris, where riot police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse protesters. The protests were due to anger over pension reforms and Macron's comments, with demonstrators demanding a return to the retirement age of 60.
- Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.
- On March 18 and 19, protests and strikes occurred in several French cities, including Nantes, Marseille, Montpellier, Besançon, Lyon, and Paris, in response to the government's pension reform plan. Some protests turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police, lighting bonfires, and occupying buildings. Union leaders anticipated that some airports would see up to a third of flights cancelled on March 20 due to strike action. easyJet and Ryanair warned passengers of potential disruptions. Union activists marched through shopping malls, and cars were allowed to pass through tolls on motorways for free. Refineries were shut down, leading to petrol queues in the south of France, although authorities claimed supplies were sufficient to avoid shortages. Waste collection in some Paris neighborhoods was disrupted, and the CGT union urged workers to continue their strike. The government threatened to order striking workers to return to work to prevent fuel shortages. The DGAC requested 30% of flights at Orly Airport and 20% in Marseille to be cancelled on March 20. Meanwhile, Macron called for support for legislators and protection for their offices, and made a public statement expressing hope that the pension reform bill would complete its democratic journey with respect for all. The leader of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, announced that his party would not back the no-confidence motions, making it unlikely for them to pass. NUPES' Jean-Luc Mélenchon urged protesters to avoid violence and keep up their struggle until the 64-year pension reform is off the table. National Rally president Jordan Bardella attempted to persuade more Republican MPs to follow Ciotti's decision by promising not to put up candidates against them in case of an election.
- Art students in Paris protested against the proposed increase in retirement age by building a barricade outside their school and carrying signs threatening a new May 1968.

Primary and middle school teachers' strike participation was estimated to be around 24%, with stronger walkouts in certain departments.
- On March 18, protests and blockades occurred across France, led by various unions including CGT and SNCF, in response to the government's push for pension changes. Protesters disrupted train stations in Bordeaux, Donges, Valenciennes, and Marseille, while striking rubbish collectors clashed with police in Ivry-sur-Seine. No-confidence motions were tabled in the National Assembly by centrist group Liot and National Rally. Interior Minister warned against chaos and violence, while police banned protests in Place de la Concorde and Champs-Élysées, leading to clashes and arrests in Paris, with 122 arrested in Paris and 169 nationwide. Protests also took place in Marseille, Nantes, Brest, Montpellier, and other cities, with some demonstrations turning violent. TotalEnergies reported that 37% of its operational staff at refineries and depots were on strike, and rolling strikes continued on railways.
- Olivier Gantois, head of UFIP, believes fuel shortages are caused by panic buying, while protests erupted in Paris, with citizens chanting for the French President's resignation. Violence was attributed to groups of 300 moving quickly through the capital, resulting in 234 arrests. Protests also occurred in other cities, with varying levels of violence. Unions and opposition parties aim to increase protests to force a change in the pension reforms. Prime Minister Borne submitted the new law to France's Constitutional Council for review, aiming to accelerate the process. Macron announced he won't withdraw or change the pension reforms, but will use a TV interview to calm tensions and prepare for future reforms. There is unease within parties aligned with Macron regarding his response to the protests and strikes.
- Prime Minister Borne and Labor Minister Dussopt have stated that they have devoted significant time to dialogue regarding the pension bill, and plan to involve the public and unions more in future legislation. However, they did not provide details on how this would be achieved. Meanwhile, President Macron is facing unease within his aligned parties due to ongoing violent protests and strikes, which represent the most significant challenge to his authority since the "Yellow Vest" revolt. Macron is planning to use a TV interview on 22 March to "calm things down" and prepare for further reforms.

There have been significant disruptions to transportation and other services due to strikes and protests. Authorities have asked airlines to cancel 20% of their flights, and there have been cancellations at Air France. Oil terminals and refineries have been blocked by strikers, leading to shortages at gas stations in southeastern France. The government has ordered rubbish collectors back to work in Paris to ensure a minimum service.

Students have also been involved in protests, blockading universities and setting skips alight during protests. Macron gave a televised interview on 22 March, where he was questioned by journalists from TF1 and France 2.
- The French police have been accused of using excessive force, making preventative arrests, and assaulting journalists during protests, according to various human rights groups, the French Defender of Rights, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association. The Council of Europe has condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned against excessive use of force by state agents. The White House and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece have expressed support for the right to protest in France. A rally in Paris saw the International Anthem played, and the General Secretary was given a "Friends of the Paris Commune" handkerchief.

- In a survey from 9-16 March, a large majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with a certain individual, with only a small percentage expressing satisfaction. Critics argue that proposed reforms disproportionately affect women, who typically retire later and with lower pensions due to part-time work and maternity leave. The reforms are also said to disproportionately impact the working class and those in manual labor jobs. Some are concerned about being forced to work beyond the retirement age due to age discrimination in the labor market. Opponents argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and the wealthy over average workers and disputes the need for urgency. Critics also take issue with the timing of the reforms during a cost-of-living crisis. The protests against the reforms have been marked by instances of violence, rioting, and looting. The unrest has been attributed in part to the unpopularity of the individual associated with the reforms. The methods used in some of the protests, such as the destruction of union property and the presence of black bloc groups, have also been criticized. The protests and unrest occurred prior to the use of a certain parliamentary procedure to pass the reforms.
- After protests in France, many people were arrested, with some being taken into custody without a clear reason. This has led to concerns about "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate." The police have been accused of using mass arrests to suppress the protest movement. The use of criminal law to discourage demonstrators is reportedly unprecedented. The police have also been accused of using excessive force and disproportionately targeting young women. The protests were sparked by a proposed increase in the retirement age. This proposal has been compared to a similar reform in 2010, which led to widespread protests and was seen as a factor in the subsequent election. There are concerns that the current protests could have political ramifications, similar to those seen in 2010.
- Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses.

Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.
- The National Rally party is trying to get more Republican MPs to join them in refusing support for certain motions by promising not to run candidates against them if an election is triggered by the crisis. There are plans for strike actions on 20 March that will cause flight cancellations and delays, particularly affecting British airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. Protesters in Rennes set rubbish piles on fire and blockaded roads, leading to traffic disruptions. Industrial action at oil refineries has started to affect fuel supplies, with shortages reported in Marseille and the south of the country. Teachers' unions have called for strikes, which may disrupt baccalauréat exams starting on 20 March. SNCF has warned of disruptions to intercity and regional train services, and garbage collection strikes are set to continue.

- Art students in Paris protested against the proposed increase in retirement age by building a barricade outside their school and carrying signs threatening a new May 1968. In Rennes, skips were set on fire during a protest. Macron, in a televised interview, defended the necessity of the reform despite its unpopularity and condemned the violence that had occurred during protests. Union leaders criticized Macron's interview, with Philippe Martinez of the CGT calling for more people to strike and Laurent Berger of the CFDT accusing Macron of lying about unions not offering an alternative. Marine Le Pen refused to help Macron resolve the crisis, accusing him of disdain for workers and insulting protesters. Fuel shortages were reported in several parts of the country due to oil refinery blockades. Unions announced another day of strikes and demonstrations for 23 March, with the largest protest expected in Paris. Public transport was severely impacted, with only two Paris metro lines running normally and many flights cancelled in Paris Orly Airport. Primary and middle school teachers' strike participation was estimated to be around 24%, with stronger walkouts in certain departments.
- Protests in France over Macron's proposed pension reforms have resulted in injuries to both protesters and police. The use of excessive force by authorities has been criticized by the Council of Europe. The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is similar to former President Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which led to widespread protests and influenced the 2012 presidential election. Invoking Article 49.3 could be perceived as brutal and erode support for the government and democratic institutions. Alternatives to the pension reforms include firing the Prime Minister, holding a referendum, or triggering a 'RIP' before the enactment of the law. However, these options have their own requirements and potential consequences. Macron has stated that he will not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. The planned state visit of King Charles III to France has been postponed due to the ongoing protests.
- In January, large-scale protests over proposed pension reforms took place in France, with over a million people demonstrating nationwide. The reforms, which included raising the retirement age and increasing annual pension contributions, were met with resistance from eight major unions. Despite the protests, the French government, led by President Emmanuel Macron, emphasized that the reforms would proceed. Further strikes and protests were announced for January 31, with public transportation, schools, and electricity production targeted. The CGT union reported 2.8 million protesters, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs counted 1.272 million. National protests continued in February, with a third day of protests on February 7 and a fourth day on February 11, with the CGT reporting over 2.5 million protesters and the Ministry of the Interior claiming 963,000. Protests and strikes continued in early March, with trains and fuel deliveries affected, and over 1.1 to 1.4 million people participating in protests across the country. The Intersyndicale called for recurring strikes starting on March 7.
- Paris's mayor supports a strike, and the government threatens to intervene if she doesn't comply. The French government, led by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, invoked Article 49.3 of the constitution to enact pension reforms without a parliamentary vote, causing protests and political backlash. Opposition MPs sang the national anthem and denounced the move, with some filing no-confidence motions. Politicians from various parties criticized the government, and protesters rallied in Paris and other cities, leading to clashes with police, arrests, and property damage. The CGT union announced further strikes and demonstrations, describing the government's move as undemocratic and disrespectful.

- The French police have been accused of using excessive force, making preventative arrests, and assaulting journalists during protests, according to various human rights groups, the French Defender of Rights, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association. The Council of Europe has condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned against excessive use of force by state agents. The White House and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece have expressed support for the right to protest in France. A rally in Paris saw the International Anthem played, and the General Secretary was given a "Friends of the Paris Commune" handkerchief.
- After protests in France, many people were arrested, with some being taken into custody without a clear reason. This has led to concerns about "arbitrary detention" and "obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate." The police have been accused of using mass arrests to suppress the protest movement. The use of criminal law to discourage demonstrators is reportedly unprecedented. The police have also been accused of using excessive force and disproportionately targeting young women. The protests were sparked by a proposed increase in the retirement age. This proposal has been compared to a similar reform in 2010, which led to widespread protests and was seen as a factor in the subsequent election. There are concerns that the current protests could have political ramifications, similar to those seen in 2010.
- Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris, with the use of baton charges, tear gas, and fireworks. A controversial police unit, Motos Brav-M, was deployed and met with boos and hisses. Violence was reported across the country, with protests in Marseille, Nice, Toulon, Lyon, Normandy, Tours, and Lorient, resulting in blocked train tracks, highways, and administrative buildings. In Paris, an officer was dragged to safety after being hit on the head, and the Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide. Protesters also set a palace on fire in Bordeaux, but it was quickly extinguished. Some protesters attempted to kill police officers, according to the Interior Minister.
- Protests against the French government's pension reform have resulted in injuries to police officers and protesters, property damage, and arrests. The Interior Minister reported that 123 police officers were injured nationwide and over 80 people were arrested. Union leaders and politicians have criticized the violence and called for non-violence. The French government has estimated 740,000 attendees at the protests, while unions claim 2 million. After the Constitutional Council declared the pension bill compatible with the Constitution, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to address anger over the reform in the next 100 days and take measures to improve work, law and order, education, and health conditions. Protesters have continued to gather and express their opposition to the pension reform, including threatening to cancel the 2024 Summer Olympics if the reform is not withdrawn.
- Protests against a controversial law in France led to the setting alight of barricades, clashes with police, and property damage in several cities. Unions described the passing of the law as undemocratic and called for further strikes and demonstrations. In Paris, over 300 people were arrested in relation to the protests. President Macron made no public comments on the matter, but reportedly expressed concern about the impact on the country's future. Protesters called for Macron's resignation and targeted symbols of wealth and power. The CGT union announced escalated strikes, including the disruption of Paris's Boulevard Périphérique and blockades at refineries and other industrial sites. Smaller protests and rallies took place in several other cities, with various forms of property damage and disruptions reported. Students also protested near Sorbonne University and at the Institute of Political Studies in Lille.
- Protests have been taking place in France since May 19, with hospital workers protesting at the Carlton Cannes Hotel and dozens gathering in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival. On June 6, 280,000 protesters marched, leading to the cancellation of one-third of flights at Orly Airport and the storming of the 2024 Summer Olympics headquarters in Paris. Law enforcement has deployed 11,000 officers, including 4,000 in Paris. There is growing concern over increasing violence in the protests, with unions and media comparing the current situation to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but anger has been mounting since the government invoked Article 49.3 without a vote. Unions are concerned about losing control of the protests to more radical demonstrators. The heads of two moderate unions have warned that protests could grow more violent if those protesting feel that the Yellow Vests have achieved more with violence than established unions with peaceful demonstrations. There have also been reports of threatening emails and vandalism targeting the offices of certain political parties.
- On March 18, protests and blockades occurred across France, led by various unions including CGT and SNCF, in response to the government's push for pension changes. Protesters disrupted train stations in Bordeaux, Donges, Valenciennes, and Marseille, while striking rubbish collectors clashed with police in Ivry-sur-Seine. No-confidence motions were tabled in the National Assembly by centrist group Liot and National Rally. Interior Minister warned against chaos and violence, while police banned protests in Place de la Concorde and Champs-Élysées, leading to clashes and arrests in Paris, with 122 arrested in Paris and 169 nationwide. Protests also took place in Marseille, Nantes, Brest, Montpellier, and other cities, with some demonstrations turning violent. TotalEnergies reported that 37% of its operational staff at refineries and depots were on strike, and rolling strikes continued on railways.
- The leader of the CGT union, Berger, cautioned the government that protests in France could turn more violent if demonstrators believe the Yellow Vests have achieved greater results through violence than peaceful mass demonstrations by established unions. Waste collectors in Paris initiated a strike on March 6, which expanded to include blockades of the city's incinerators, causing thousands of tonnes of rubbish to accumulate on the streets. Despite efforts by the government to end the strike, Paris's mayor, Hidalgo, has expressed her support for the strikers. The waste collection strike also impacted other cities, including Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre. Police have requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods, and many of those arrested during the protests were later released without charge.
- Olivier Gantois, head of UFIP, believes fuel shortages are caused by panic buying, while protests erupted in Paris, with citizens chanting for the French President's resignation. Violence was attributed to groups of 300 moving quickly through the capital, resulting in 234 arrests. Protests also occurred in other cities, with varying levels of violence. Unions and opposition parties aim to increase protests to force a change in the pension reforms. Prime Minister Borne submitted the new law to France's Constitutional Council for review, aiming to accelerate the process. Macron announced he won't withdraw or change the pension reforms, but will use a TV interview to calm tensions and prepare for future reforms. There is unease within parties aligned with Macron regarding his response to the protests and strikes.
- Unions have been organizing recurring strikes across France since January 19, with the largest protests attracting up to 1.4 million people. The strikes have caused disruptions in transportation, including the cancellation of flights and trains. Union members have also blocked fuel deliveries in an attempt to halt the French economy. The protests were in response to the government's plan to reform the pension system, which would raise the retirement age. The government eventually enacted the reforms without a parliamentary vote, invoking Article 49:3 of the constitution, which led to protests and jeering inside the National Assembly. There were conflicting reports on the number of protesters, with estimates ranging from 37,000 to 450,000 in Paris alone. The protests were coordinated by eight trade unions and affected various sectors, including transportation, education, and energy. The police had to intervene in some cities to control violence and clear out garbage that had accumulated due to the strike by garbage collectors. The government threatened to force some of the garbage workers to return to work, citing public health concerns.
- Unionists and strikers protested at several locations in France, including Gare de Lyon train station and Charles de Gaulle Airport, causing disruptions to transportation and exams. Workers at an LNG terminal in Dunkirk reduced output, and oil refinery and depot blockades led to fuel shortages. Protests also occurred at major tourist attractions and universities, with varying numbers of demonstrators reported. While most protests were peaceful, there were instances of violence in Paris, where riot police used tear gas and baton charges to disperse protesters. The protests were due to anger over pension reforms and Macron's comments, with demonstrators demanding a return to the retirement age of 60.
- The left-wing coalition NUPES and some French deputies argue that a pension reform, included in the social security budget, is unconstitutional as it addresses more than just finances. They plan to use the Conseil d'État's warning to the government about the reform's potential unconstitutionality. In March, President Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms, and the state visit of King Charles III was postponed due to ongoing protests. The cancellation was met with mixed reactions in France, while international reactions included criticism from Iran and human rights organizations accusing French authorities of excessive force and violating protestors' rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities to protect peaceful demonstrations.

- The text describes widespread destruction in several Turkish cities, including Adana, Malatya, and Gaziantep, due to earthquakes. In Adana, many buildings were destroyed or damaged, and recovery efforts uncovered human remains. Malatya suffered extensive damage, with over 300 buildings destroyed and 60% of its structures damaged. Many mosques and two hotels also collapsed, and the airport ceiling caved in. In Gaziantep, numerous historical sites were severely damaged, and over 16,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The city's airport had to restrict flights to rescue missions. Hatay Province experienced significant damage, with over 13,000 buildings collapsing and many cultural sites destroyed. A large fire at İskenderun's port, possibly caused by a container of flammable industrial oil, also occurred.
- The text describes the destruction caused by earthquakes in several provinces in Turkey and Syria. In Adıyaman, four neighborhoods were destroyed, including the city hall, a 6th-century mosque, a hospital, and a hotel, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Other districts in Adıyaman and in Diyarbakir, Şanlıurfa, Osmaniye, Kilis, Batman, Mardin, Bingöl, Samsun, Kayseri, Muş, Sivas, and Giresun provinces also experienced significant damage and loss of life. In Syria, at least 8,476 people died and over 14,500 were injured, with a high number of children and women among the casualties. The Syrian Ministry of Health and various human rights organizations have recorded deaths and injuries in both government-held and rebel-held areas. The text also notes the deaths of several notable individuals, including a member of the Turkish parliament, a soccer player, a former national handball team player and his son, a community leader, a former MP, and several rescue workers, journalists, doctors, and police officers.
- In the aftermath of the earthquake in Hatay Province, Reyhanlı, Arsuz, Kumlu, and Payas experienced significant building damage, with many collapsing and requiring demolition. İskenderun was hit particularly hard, with a large fire at the port causing extensive damage and hindering operations. The city also saw numerous building collapses, severe damage, and fatalities. Other districts such as Erzin, Samandağ, Hassa, Altınözü, Yayladağı, Belen, and Dörtyol also suffered building damage and loss of life. Mass burials took place in Kahramanmaraş, and many buildings were destroyed in Adıyaman Province, including four neighborhoods in the city of Adıyaman. Other areas such as Elbistan, Ekinözü, Afşin, Ericek, Nurhak, and Türkoğlu also experienced significant damage and loss of life.
- The text describes the aftermath of a severe earthquake in Turkey, with a maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of X (Extreme) along the fault rupture, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Geological effects such as liquefaction, lateral spreading, subsidence, and flooding were observed in various areas, including Antakya, Samandağ, Lake Gölbaşı, and İskenderun. A tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, with small waves reaching the coasts of Cyprus, İskenderun, and Erdemli. The earthquake resulted in over 50,000 deaths, thousands of injuries, and millions of people affected across 11 provinces in Turkey. Approximately 345,000 apartments were destroyed, and over 2 million residents were evacuated. The disaster also caused significant damage to agricultural production, infrastructure, and university buildings. A damage assessment revealed that at least 61,722 buildings needed to be demolished, and many roads showed broad fissures. In Adana and Malatya, hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, with numerous casualties reported.
- The main stock market in the country experienced a drop of 1.35% on February 6, while the Borsa Istanbul fell by 8.6% on February 7 and was suspended after declining more than 7% on February 8. The exchange announced a five-day closure. The cost of earthquake damage in Turkey is estimated to be $84.1 billion, with $70.75 billion needed for rebuilding, $10.4 billion in lost national income, and an additional $2.91 billion in workforce losses. The Turkish government's preliminary report estimated the total damage cost at $103.6 billion, equivalent to 9% of its GDP in 2023. In Syria, the World Bank estimated $5.1 billion in damages, with nearly half on residential buildings and 18% on infrastructure. The reconstruction cost is estimated at $7.9 billion, with the economy potentially contracting by up to 5.5% in 2023. Thousands were trapped under rubble in Turkey, and many were left homeless. Officials opened hotels and schools for temporary accommodation. Mosques, shopping malls, stadiums, and community centers were used as shelters. Turkish humanitarian institutions and airlines launched emergency appeals and provided free flights for victims and volunteers. The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority opened an invitation for citizen volunteers. Search and rescue teams were immediately dispatched to the affected area, and residents were urged to avoid entering damaged buildings.
- The Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.7 earthquakes on February 6, 2023, in Turkey, had slip extensions of 18 km and 12 km, respectively. The Mw 6.4 aftershock in Antakya on February 20 had a rupture area of 25 km x 25 km and a peak slip of 0.93 m at a depth of 8.3 km. The M7.8 earthquake added up to 3 bars of stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock and 1 bar to the Hatay Fault, potentially triggering rupture. The initial rupture started on the Narlı Fault, then moved unilaterally northwards, bilaterally northeast and southwest along the East Anatolian Fault, and possibly along the Sakçagöz Fault. The second M>7 earthquake occurred on the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone, part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault, and lasted about 35 seconds. Surface ruptures from the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes were mapped using satellite imagery and ground observations.
- After the earthquake in Turkey, prisoners demanded to see their families affected by the disaster. Rescue operations by German and Austrian teams were halted due to worsening security but resumed with protection from the Turkish military. The Israeli rescue team left due to a specific threat. A family of seven Syrian refugees died in a fire, and a gas explosion in Şanlıurfa killed two. A bus collision killed two earthquake survivors. An IF1 tornado at a camp for earthquake victims killed three and injured 50. Floods in Adıyaman and Şanlıurfa killed at least 14. Elections planned for May 2023 faced uncertainty, with some calling for a delay, but the AKP later stated they would not be postponed. The earthquake caused the main opposition coalition to delay their meeting for selecting a presidential candidate. Education and sports were suspended in the affected provinces.
- The World Bank is providing aid and assessing the urgent needs following the earthquakes in Turkey, which is facing criticism for allegedly covering up the facts about the mainshocks and manipulating the death toll. The Turkish government has been accused of inadequately enforcing building codes, leading to the collapse of many buildings, including newly constructed ones. Critics also accuse the government of allowing contractors to bypass safety measures in housing projects, which they claim has put residents at risk. Satellite imagery and the opinions of experts contradict the government's claims about the age of the destroyed buildings. Protests have erupted in some areas, and the opposition leader has accused the president of being responsible for the disaster's scale.
- On February 6, 2023, a Mw 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey, followed by over 120 aftershocks within 12 hours, including a Mww 6.3 aftershock near Uzunbağ in Hatay Province. The main earthquake involved three fault segments, with the largest slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2. A second Mw 7.7 earthquake followed nine hours later, with a maximum displacement of 11.4 m (37 ft) on Segment 1. The Çardak Fault was the primary location of slip for both earthquakes, which was mostly shallow and compact. A Mw 6.4 aftershock hit Antakya on February 20, with a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth. The USGS model suggests that the M7.8 earthquake may have added up to 3 bars of stress to the Çardak–Sürgü Fault, potentially triggering the Mw 7.7 earthquake.

- Two significant earthquakes, with magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.7, hit Turkey in early 2023, along the East Anatolian Fault. These quakes are among the most powerful in Turkey's history, causing thousands of fatalities and extensive damage. The first quake, measured at 7.8, occurred near Gaziantep, while the second, at 7.7, struck near Ekinözü. These quakes resulted in over 570 aftershocks within the first 24 hours and more than 30,000 by May 2023. The first earthquake had aftershocks along approximately 350 km (220 mi) of the EAF, while the second triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two with magnitudes of 6.0. The first earthquake was the largest in Turkey in over 2,000 years, with a reevaluated magnitude of 7.95 ± 0.013. The second earthquake had a reevaluated magnitude of 7.86 ± 0.012. The study in the 2002 Earth and Planetary Science Letters research paper highlighted two seismic gaps with high potential for future earthquakes, one of which, the Kahramanmaraş gap, is believed to last rupture in 1513 and could produce a magnitude 7.3 earthquake.
- The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research suggested a link between a recent earthquake and beached whales due to their echolocation systems being affected by sea disturbances. This earthquake caused shaking felt in several countries, including Iraq and Egypt, where damage to buildings and infrastructure was reported. Aftershocks followed, including a Mww 6.3 aftershock in Antakya and a Mww 5.2 aftershock in Yeşilyurt, resulting in further damage and casualties. The USGS PAGER service and Risklayer estimated significant potential economic losses and a high death toll. The earthquake also had a severe impact on Turkish financial markets, with the lira and stock markets falling sharply. The total cost of earthquake damage in Turkey is estimated to be around $84.1 billion US dollars, according to TÜRKONFED, and $103.6 billion according to the Turkish government, which corresponds to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023.
- The first round of the Turkish presidential election resulted in a run-off, and education and sports events were significantly impacted by a recent earthquake. Schools and universities in affected provinces were closed, and sports competitions, such as Süper Lig and various hockey and volleyball tournaments, were either canceled or suspended. The earthquake also resulted in fatalities among sports teams, including the entire high school volleyball team of Türk Maarif Koleji and several Paralympic football players from Iran. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad organized a rescue plan for affected regions, and both the Syrian government and the UK government appealed for international aid. However, the United Nations reported that damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey.

Geological effects such as liquefaction, lateral spreading, subsidence, and flooding were observed in various areas, including Antakya, Samandağ, Lake Gölbaşı, and İskenderun. A tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, with small waves reaching the coasts of Cyprus, İskenderun, and Erdemli. The earthquake resulted in over 50,000 deaths, thousands of injuries, and millions of people affected across 11 provinces in Turkey. Approximately 345,000 apartments were destroyed, and over 2 million residents were evacuated. The disaster also caused significant damage to agricultural production, infrastructure, and university buildings. A damage assessment revealed that at least 61,722 buildings needed to be demolished, and many roads showed broad fissures. In Adana and Malatya, hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, with numerous casualties reported.
- After the earthquake in Turkey, prisoners demanded to see their families affected by the disaster. Rescue operations by German and Austrian teams were halted due to worsening security but resumed with protection from the Turkish military. The Israeli rescue team left due to a specific threat. A family of seven Syrian refugees died in a fire, and a gas explosion in Şanlıurfa killed two. A bus collision killed two earthquake survivors. An IF1 tornado at a camp for earthquake victims killed three and injured 50. Floods in Adıyaman and Şanlıurfa killed at least 14. Elections planned for May 2023 faced uncertainty, with some calling for a delay, but the AKP later stated they would not be postponed. The earthquake caused the main opposition coalition to delay their meeting for selecting a presidential candidate. Education and sports were suspended in the affected provinces.
- The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research suggested a link between a recent earthquake and beached whales due to their echolocation systems being affected by sea disturbances. This earthquake caused shaking felt in several countries, including Iraq and Egypt, where damage to buildings and infrastructure was reported. Aftershocks followed, including a Mww 6.3 aftershock in Antakya and a Mww 5.2 aftershock in Yeşilyurt, resulting in further damage and casualties. The USGS PAGER service and Risklayer estimated significant potential economic losses and a high death toll. The earthquake also had a severe impact on Turkish financial markets, with the lira and stock markets falling sharply. The total cost of earthquake damage in Turkey is estimated to be around $84.1 billion US dollars, according to TÜRKONFED, and $103.6 billion according to the Turkish government, which corresponds to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023.
- The first round of the Turkish presidential election resulted in a run-off, and education and sports events were significantly impacted by a recent earthquake. Schools and universities in affected provinces were closed, and sports competitions, such as Süper Lig and various hockey and volleyball tournaments, were either canceled or suspended. The earthquake also resulted in fatalities among sports teams, including the entire high school volleyball team of Türk Maarif Koleji and several Paralympic football players from Iran. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad organized a rescue plan for affected regions, and both the Syrian government and the UK government appealed for international aid. However, the United Nations reported that damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey.
- The text describes widespread destruction in several Turkish cities, including Adana, Malatya, and Gaziantep, due to earthquakes. In Adana, many buildings were destroyed or damaged, and recovery efforts uncovered human remains. Malatya suffered extensive damage, with over 300 buildings destroyed and 60% of its structures damaged. Many mosques and two hotels also collapsed, and the airport ceiling caved in. In Gaziantep, numerous historical sites were severely damaged, and over 16,000 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The city's airport had to restrict flights to rescue missions. Hatay Province experienced significant damage, with over 13,000 buildings collapsing and many cultural sites destroyed. A large fire at İskenderun's port, possibly caused by a container of flammable industrial oil, also occurred.
- The text describes the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Syria and surrounding countries. In Syria, the earthquake caused further damage to buildings already weakened by the country's ongoing civil war. Notable damage occurred in Aleppo, where many buildings collapsed and over 400 people died, and in the ancient castles of Margat, Krak des Chevaliers, and Sahyun. In addition, the earthquake caused extensive damage in southern Turkey, resulting in the deaths of at least 6,600 Syrian refugees and 11 Iraqi war refugees. The earthquake also caused damage in Lebanon, Israel, and Cyprus, and was felt as far away as Egypt, Iraq, and Russia. Aftershocks, including a Mww 6.3 tremor on February 20, caused further damage and loss of life in Turkey. The disaster resulted in significant loss of life and property, as well as displacement of people in the affected regions.
- The World Bank is providing aid and assessing the urgent needs following the earthquakes in Turkey, which is facing criticism for allegedly covering up the facts about the mainshocks and manipulating the death toll. The Turkish government has been accused of inadequately enforcing building codes, leading to the collapse of many buildings, including newly constructed ones. Critics also accuse the government of allowing contractors to bypass safety measures in housing projects, which they claim has put residents at risk. Satellite imagery and the opinions of experts contradict the government's claims about the age of the destroyed buildings. Protests have erupted in some areas, and the opposition leader has accused the president of being responsible for the disaster's scale.
- After a series of earthquakes in Samandağ, residents were left to search for victims due to a slow and insufficient government response. The government faced criticism for limiting access to Twitter and imposing fines and suspensions on media outlets covering the disaster. Authorities arrested individuals for "provocative posts" on social media and for looting, with Syrian refugees being particularly targeted and facing discrimination. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees have been reported. A judicial investigation has been initiated to hold accountable those responsible for building collapses, resulting in arrests and investigations of contractors, surveyors, and experts. Journalists have been detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake.
- After the earthquake in İzmir, Turkey in 2020, the government was accused of profiting from a zoning amnesty law and neglecting certain residents in the recovery efforts. Opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu criticized the government's response and called for aid to be distributed without bureaucratic obstacles. The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) was criticized for its slow response, which was attributed to increasing centralization and lack of autonomy. The military's late deployment and the seizure of aid by local governors were also criticized. The opposition voted against a state of emergency in affected provinces, claiming it was unnecessary. The government limited access to Twitter, causing public anger as it was used to share information on aid and survivors. The Peoples' Democratic Party stated that the block would hinder aid organization.
- Thousands of volunteers and emergency workers from various organizations, including Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, and the Turkish Red Crescent, have been evacuating and providing aid to people affected by earthquakes in southern Turkey. The Turkish government has declared a state of emergency in the 10 affected provinces and has appealed for international aid. Search and rescue operations have been ongoing, with over 53,000 emergency workers and numerous international teams deployed to the area. However, poor weather conditions and damaged infrastructure have hindered these efforts. The government has also pledged to provide compensation to those who have lost their homes.
- Two significant earthquakes, with magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.7, hit Turkey in early 2023, along the East Anatolian Fault. These quakes are among the most powerful in Turkey's history, causing thousands of fatalities and extensive damage. The first quake, measured at 7.8, occurred near Gaziantep, while the second, at 7.7, struck near Ekinözü. These quakes resulted in over 570 aftershocks within the first 24 hours and more than 30,000 by May 2023. The first earthquake had aftershocks along approximately 350 km (220 mi) of the EAF, while the second triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two with magnitudes of 6.0. The first earthquake was the largest in Turkey in over 2,000 years, with a reevaluated magnitude of 7.95 ± 0.013. The second earthquake had a reevaluated magnitude of 7.86 ± 0.012. The study in the 2002 Earth and Planetary Science Letters research paper highlighted two seismic gaps with high potential for future earthquakes, one of which, the Kahramanmaraş gap, is believed to last rupture in 1513 and could produce a magnitude 7.3 earthquake.

- The Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.7 earthquakes on February 6, 2023, in Turkey, had slip extensions of 18 km and 12 km, respectively. The Mw 6.4 aftershock in Antakya on February 20 had a rupture area of 25 km x 25 km and a peak slip of 0.93 m at a depth of 8.3 km. The M7.8 earthquake added up to 3 bars of stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock and 1 bar to the Hatay Fault, potentially triggering rupture. The initial rupture started on the Narlı Fault, then moved unilaterally northwards, bilaterally northeast and southwest along the East Anatolian Fault, and possibly along the Sakçagöz Fault. The second M>7 earthquake occurred on the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone, part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault, and lasted about 35 seconds. Surface ruptures from the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes were mapped using satellite imagery and ground observations.
- On February 6, 2023, a Mw 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey, followed by over 120 aftershocks within 12 hours, including a Mww 6.3 aftershock near Uzunbağ in Hatay Province. The main earthquake involved three fault segments, with the largest slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2. A second Mw 7.7 earthquake followed nine hours later, with a maximum displacement of 11.4 m (37 ft) on Segment 1. The Çardak Fault was the primary location of slip for both earthquakes, which was mostly shallow and compact. A Mw 6.4 aftershock hit Antakya on February 20, with a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth. The USGS model suggests that the M7.8 earthquake may have added up to 3 bars of stress to the Çardak–Sürgü Fault, potentially triggering the Mw 7.7 earthquake.

- The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides a detailed analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State. Earlier reports, such as "The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State (2007)" and "The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy," outline the expected effects of climate change on various sectors, including forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These impacts are primarily based on temperature and precipitation models, with a projected warming of 0.5 °F every ten years. Visible environmental consequences include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels.

Economic and ecological repercussions will result from these physical changes, particularly in hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Sectors such as agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and others will experience negative effects due to climate change. The economy of Washington State, which has a gross state product of approximately $268.5 billion, will be significantly influenced by these impacts.

Climate change can directly affect the availability and quality of resources that generate economic activity, as well as human health, leading to reduced quality of life. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of having their natural habitats disrupted due to glacier melting and altered water flow patterns.
- The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report highlights the significant impact of climate change on Washington State, influencing its economy and natural resources. Glacier melting, a result of global warming, is causing streams to diminish in national parks, such as North Cascades, Mount Rainier, and Olympic. This melting also threatens the unique meadows in Paradise Valley, potentially allowing trees to overtake the area and disrupting wildflowers. Forestlands, a significant part of Washington's economy, could experience changes in tree growth rates and pest populations due to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Climate change may reduce timber yields and introduce new pests, impacting the lumber industry. Electricity production, particularly hydropower, will be affected by altered peak snowpack melt, stream flows, and temperature changes, potentially increasing summer demands and decreasing early spring availability.
- The text discusses the impact of climate change on various industries in Washington state, particularly agriculture and fishing. In agriculture, the Yakima River Basin is expected to experience a decrease in irrigation water supply due to reduced snowpack, affecting crops such as dairy production, wine grapes, and wheat. The wine industry may shift from Eastern to Western Washington due to temperature changes, affecting land value, production, revenue, and employment. Wheat production in Eastern Washington is at risk due to inaccurate temperature predictions caused by topography. Vineyards, especially in Eastern Washington, may suffer greater losses due to increased instances of extreme weather. In the fishing industry, rising temperatures and potential ocean acidification pose a threat to Washington's fishing grounds, which could impact livelihoods and food sources for millions of people. Additionally, decreased snowfall and increased rain due to climate change may lead to decreased snowpack, affecting water storage and threatening salmon runs. Invasive species like Swollen Bladderwort may also spread due to warming temperatures, leading to habitat loss and increased fish mortality rates.
- The text discusses Washington state's efforts to manage coastal non-point pollution and protect coastal areas through the Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan and the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. Climate change is expected to cause sea level rise (SLR) in Washington, with estimates projecting a rise of 8 inches per century in Seattle and up to 16 inches by 2040 in Tacoma. This SLR will impact coastal areas, including shipping terminals, marinas, and recreational facilities, and could cost billions of dollars to protect shorelines. The text also notes the impact of climate change on Washington's ski industry, with increased rain and decreased snowfall affecting winter recreation and the state's economy.
- Washington state's water supply, particularly in the Seattle region, is expected to decrease due to climate change, threatening both human and wildlife populations. This decrease is attributed to the decline of glaciers and mountain snowpack, which serve as a crucial water source. The shift from snow to rain, as well as altered precipitation patterns, will affect different regions differently, with some experiencing more severe impacts than others. The decrease in water supply will also affect agriculture, as it is sensitive to climate variability and weather extremes. The state will need to find new water sources and implement measures to adapt to these changes, such as increasing water prices or building larger reservoirs, but these solutions may not be enough to counteract the effects of climate change.
- Climate change will significantly impact Washington's electricity supply and municipal water systems. The state's heavy reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) makes it vulnerable to changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows, potentially causing a shift in peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer flow. This could result in increased electricity availability in early spring when demand is low and decreased availability in summer when demand is high. The economic impact of climate change on hydropower is concerning, with predictions of a $730 million deficit by 2040. Additionally, the state's municipal water systems, particularly in Seattle, may face capacity issues by 2050 due to shorter winters, longer summers, and a predicted 14% drop in water supply by 2040. The region's water supply, primarily from glaciers and mountain snowpack, is expected to decline as temperatures rise, affecting both human and wildlife populations. Different regions will be impacted differently based on their population size and water supply sources. The Seattle region, which gets the bulk of its water from the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds, will need to find new water sources as water levels decrease due to global warming.
- Climate change's impact on Washington's snowpack levels will result in earlier peak flows in streams and rivers, increased flooding, and loss of irrigation and drinking water, affecting agriculture, fishing, and salmon runs. Decreased snowpack also allows invasive species like Swollen Bladderwort to spread, leading to habitat loss and increased fish mortality. Warmer temperatures and altered habitats may boost some high-priced species but negatively affect others, causing economic consequences for the fishing industry. The fisheries sector, already strained by overcapacity and conflicts, will need adaptable and flexible management systems to address climate change. Previous salmon fishery closures in the past have resulted in significant economic aid and increased costs for habitat restoration, data collection, and salmon license buyback programs. Future climate change effects on commercial salmon fisheries may lead to further increases in government-sponsored buyback programs.
- Climate change will alter water flow patterns in snow-dominant regions like Washington state, causing them to behave more like rain regions with two peak flows (spring from snowmelt and winter from rain). Agriculture is sensitive to climate variability and weather extremes, and may be negatively impacted by the increased frequency of heat stress, droughts, and floods. The Yakima River Basin, the state's most productive and driest agricultural region, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as water shortages will cause significant economic losses. The full set of anticipated climate shifts and their impact on agricultural production across the country is largely unknown. Simple tools used to forecast the impacts of El Niño on agriculture irrigation can also be used to estimate the impacts of water shortages during climate change.
- The text discusses the economic and health impacts of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on the fisheries industry and infectious diseases. Regarding the economy, the text mentions that the expansion of restored fisheries in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho could generate $5.5 billion annually, while their loss could lead to significant revenue loss. The text also highlights that sport fishermen, who spend more money per fish caught, are often left out in salmon allocation discussions, which can harm local economies when salmon populations are low. In terms of health, the text discusses the link between climate change and the West Nile fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and has already cost millions in other states. Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease, is also mentioned as a potential threat. Lastly, the text notes that global warming can exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma and allergies due to increased pollen production and fungal growth.
- Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on plant and animal life in coastal Washington. A half-degree temperature rise each decade will lead to increased flooding, affecting commercial and recreational activities and causing shifts in plant and animal species' distribution, habitats, and biodiversity. Plants, particularly those at higher elevations, will experience reduced growth and range due to water shortages and the encroachment of tree lines. Animal life, including invertebrates, birds, and mammals, will also experience range shifts, with invertebrates being particularly affected by temporal mismatches and expanding insect populations. Amphibians are expected to be among the worst affected due to their dependence on specific microhabitats and water regimes.
- The text discusses the impact of climate change on respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, and coastal management in the Pacific Northwest. Regarding health, increased CO2 levels from human activities can exacerbate allergies and asthma due to stimulated pollen production and fungal growth. The text notes that Washington has a high prevalence of asthma, costing over $400 million yearly. In terms of heat-related illnesses, increased average yearly temperatures and more frequent heatwaves can lead to heat cramps, exhaustion, and stroke, with high costs for each mortality. Coastal management is also affected by climate change, with research suggesting that decreased forest cover and pollution can impact coastal waters. The text highlights the importance of federal consistency in coastal zone management and the development of a Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan. Lastly, the text mentions the impact of climate change on the ski industry in Washington's mountainous regions due to more rain and less snow.

- Washington State promotes public participation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through various initiatives. The Climate Advisory Team (CAT) offers incentives for factories to decrease emissions, and working groups propose proactive approaches to address climate change impacts. The Citizen Engagement and Action Framework (CEAF) encourages citizens to take responsibility in reducing their environmental impact. CAT's guide to reducing Washington State's greenhouse gases includes comprehensive goals such as building market-based mechanisms, establishing emissions reporting, investing in worker training, promoting efficient transportation, designing energy-efficient buildings, delivering energy from lower-carbon sources, restoring farm and forest lands, reducing waste, and allocating state resources. Seattle enacted a green building policy in 2000, and Washington State requires new public buildings to meet LEED standards. Green building has economic benefits, with increased market value and life cycle savings. Global greenhouse gas emissions are rising, and Washington State is working with Oregon and California to reduce emissions as part of the West Coast Governors’ Global Warming Initiative. The state categorizes greenhouse gases into energy, industrial processes, and agriculture, with different gases having varying impacts on global warming.
- Following the declaration of economic aid due to the impact of climate change on Washington's commercial salmon fisheries, $25 million was provided via the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan, with $13.6 million allocated to Washington. This supported habitat restoration, data collection, and salmon license buyback programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Rural Development Administration also provided additional funds. The cost of these programs may continue to increase as global warming further degrades existing commercial salmon fisheries, potentially leading to an increase in government-sponsored buyback programs. These programs, which include Vessel Buyback Programs and License Retirement Programs, cost an average of $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets but can rise as high as $10 million for larger vessels. The economic impact of restored salmon habitat on recreational fisheries in the state of Washington could potentially yield $1 billion in revenue and 9,400 jobs. However, the increase in temperatures will negatively affect not only salmon but also other economically used fish such as Dungeness crab, steelhead, Hake, and Mackerel, potentially leading to significant economic consequences for local economies.

The economic impact of climate change on hydropower is concerning, with predictions of a $730 million deficit by 2040. Additionally, the state's municipal water systems, particularly in Seattle, may face capacity issues by 2050 due to shorter winters, longer summers, and a predicted 14% drop in water supply by 2040. The region's water supply, primarily from glaciers and mountain snowpack, is expected to decline as temperatures rise, affecting both human and wildlife populations. Different regions will be impacted differently based on their population size and water supply sources. The Seattle region, which gets the bulk of its water from the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds, will need to find new water sources as water levels decrease due to global warming.

- The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report highlights the significant impact of climate change on Washington State, influencing its economy and natural resources. Glacier melting, a result of global warming, is causing streams to diminish in national parks, such as North Cascades, Mount Rainier, and Olympic. This melting also threatens the unique meadows in Paradise Valley, potentially allowing trees to overtake the area and disrupting wildflowers. Forestlands, a significant part of Washington's economy, could experience changes in tree growth rates and pest populations due to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Climate change may reduce timber yields and introduce new pests, impacting the lumber industry. Electricity production, particularly hydropower, will be affected by altered peak snowpack melt, stream flows, and temperature changes, potentially increasing summer demands and decreasing early spring availability.
- The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides a detailed analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State. Earlier reports, such as "The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State (2007)" and "The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy," outline the expected effects of climate change on various sectors, including forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These impacts are primarily based on temperature and precipitation models, with a projected warming of 0.5 °F every ten years. Visible environmental consequences include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels.

Economic and ecological repercussions will result from these physical changes, particularly in hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Sectors such as agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and others will experience negative effects due to climate change. The economy of Washington State, which has a gross state product of approximately $268.5 billion, will be significantly influenced by these impacts.

Climate change can directly affect the availability and quality of resources that generate economic activity, as well as human health, leading to reduced quality of life. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of having their natural habitats disrupted due to glacier melting and altered water flow patterns.
- The text discusses the impact of climate change on respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, and coastal management in the Pacific Northwest. Regarding health, increased CO2 levels from human activities can exacerbate allergies and asthma due to stimulated pollen production and fungal growth. The text notes that Washington has a high prevalence of asthma, costing over $400 million yearly. In terms of heat-related illnesses, increased average yearly temperatures and more frequent heatwaves can lead to heat cramps, exhaustion, and stroke, with high costs for each mortality. Coastal management is also affected by climate change, with research suggesting that decreased forest cover and pollution can impact coastal waters. The text highlights the importance of federal consistency in coastal zone management and the development of a Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan. Lastly, the text mentions the impact of climate change on the ski industry in Washington's mountainous regions due to more rain and less snow.
- The text discusses the economic and health impacts of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on the fisheries industry and infectious diseases. Regarding the economy, the text mentions that the expansion of restored fisheries in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho could generate $5.5 billion annually, while their loss could lead to significant revenue loss. The text also highlights that sport fishermen, who spend more money per fish caught, are often left out in salmon allocation discussions, which can harm local economies when salmon populations are low. In terms of health, the text discusses the link between climate change and the West Nile fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and has already cost millions in other states. Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease, is also mentioned as a potential threat. Lastly, the text notes that global warming can exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma and allergies due to increased pollen production and fungal growth.
- The text discusses Washington state's efforts to manage coastal non-point pollution and protect coastal areas through the Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan and the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. Climate change is expected to cause sea level rise (SLR) in Washington, with estimates projecting a rise of 8 inches per century in Seattle and up to 16 inches by 2040 in Tacoma. This SLR will impact coastal areas, including shipping terminals, marinas, and recreational facilities, and could cost billions of dollars to protect shorelines. The text also notes the impact of climate change on Washington's ski industry, with increased rain and decreased snowfall affecting winter recreation and the state's economy.
- The text discusses the increased risk of flooding in coastal Washington due to climate change, with a half-degree temperature rise each decade causing oceans to warm, expand, and melt ice caps. This results in a higher sea level, threatening homes, businesses, and infrastructure, especially in low-lying areas like Tacoma and Olympia. The economic impact of flooding is significant, affecting commercial and recreational activities. Additionally, the ecological impact of climate change is discussed, with changes in temperature and precipitation affecting plant and animal life, leading to shifts in species distribution, changes in community composition, and a potential loss of biodiversity. The impact on plant life is significant, with changes in water use efficiency, growing season length, and species distribution already observed. The effects of climate change on non-vascular and vascular plants are also discussed, with higher elevation plants expected to suffer from reductions in growth and range.
- Climate change has varying impacts on different animal groups. Mammals are relatively resilient, with some effects on fecundity and distribution, while amphibians are among the most negatively affected due to their dependence on specific water regimes and microhabitats, with rapid population declines and extinctions linked to climate change. Reptiles face phenological challenges and physiological constraints, with reproduction and development directly linked to climate. Fish will experience significant distribution changes, particularly in freshwater habitats, due to temperature increases and altered stream flows. Wetlands, crucial for CO2 absorption, water filtration, and wildlife habitats, will reduce in area and face flooding, drying, or relocation threats. Current climate change is primarily caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, including CO2 from fossil fuel burning and methane from agricultural activities.
- Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on plant and animal life in coastal Washington. A half-degree temperature rise each decade will lead to increased flooding, affecting commercial and recreational activities and causing shifts in plant and animal species' distribution, habitats, and biodiversity. Plants, particularly those at higher elevations, will experience reduced growth and range due to water shortages and the encroachment of tree lines. Animal life, including invertebrates, birds, and mammals, will also experience range shifts, with invertebrates being particularly affected by temporal mismatches and expanding insect populations. Amphibians are expected to be among the worst affected due to their dependence on specific microhabitats and water regimes.
- In 2011, Washington State published a report outlining strategies to prepare natural systems for climate change impacts, focusing on building adaptive capacity for species, habitats, and ecosystems. The state's GHG emissions, primarily from human activities such as fossil fuel burning and agricultural practices, contribute 0.3% of global annual emissions, with transportation being the main source, accounting for 43% of the total. Traffic congestion in Seattle alone results in $1.4 billion in costs and 496,230 metric tons of CO2 emissions yearly. Seattle has committed to reducing GHG emissions by 7% by 2012, following the Kyoto Protocol's guidelines, aiming to cut emissions by approximately 680,000 tons per year. The city's Climate Action Plan focuses on reducing car dependence, enhancing public transportation, increasing fuel efficiency, utilizing biofuels, and promoting cleaner energy for homes and businesses.
- Climate change will alter water flow patterns in snow-dominant regions like Washington state, causing them to behave more like rain regions with two peak flows (spring from snowmelt and winter from rain). Agriculture is sensitive to climate variability and weather extremes, and may be negatively impacted by the increased frequency of heat stress, droughts, and floods. The Yakima River Basin, the state's most productive and driest agricultural region, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as water shortages will cause significant economic losses. The full set of anticipated climate shifts and their impact on agricultural production across the country is largely unknown. Simple tools used to forecast the impacts of El Niño on agriculture irrigation can also be used to estimate the impacts of water shortages during climate change.
- The text discusses the impact of climate change on various industries in Washington state, particularly agriculture and fishing. In agriculture, the Yakima River Basin is expected to experience a decrease in irrigation water supply due to reduced snowpack, affecting crops such as dairy production, wine grapes, and wheat. The wine industry may shift from Eastern to Western Washington due to temperature changes, affecting land value, production, revenue, and employment. Wheat production in Eastern Washington is at risk due to inaccurate temperature predictions caused by topography. Vineyards, especially in Eastern Washington, may suffer greater losses due to increased instances of extreme weather. In the fishing industry, rising temperatures and potential ocean acidification pose a threat to Washington's fishing grounds, which could impact livelihoods and food sources for millions of people. Additionally, decreased snowfall and increased rain due to climate change may lead to decreased snowpack, affecting water storage and threatening salmon runs. Invasive species like Swollen Bladderwort may also spread due to warming temperatures, leading to habitat loss and increased fish mortality rates.

- A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning.
- After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.
- Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness.
- Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases.
- After learning about Nagaenthran's death warrant, international and local human rights groups, including the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN Commission on Human Rights, urged the Singapore government to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence. An online petition gained over 102,000 signatures, and there were plans to bring the case to the International Court of Justice. Diplomats from the Malaysian embassy provided consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who were able to visit him in prison. Nagaenthran's mental state appeared to have deteriorated, with his brother and a neighboring death row inmate reporting erratic behavior. Amidst these concerns, the Malaysian government faced pressure to intervene, and the Ministry of Home Affairs released a statement addressing the situation. The execution date, close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, was also criticized.
- The execution of Nagaenthran, a Malaysian man convicted of drug trafficking in Singapore, was scheduled close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, causing criticism. Despite international and local pressure to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintained that Nagaenthran was accorded due process and was represented by legal counsel. They reiterated the final court verdict, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress and was mentally competent for execution. The Malaysian government, including the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, appealed to Singapore's leaders for leniency, while lawyers from Malaysia condemned Singapore's response and launched protests. The European Union also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran. However, a last-minute appeal was dismissed by the High Court, citing a lack of evidence to support claims of Nagaenthran's deteriorating mental state and no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law.
- Nagaenthran's mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, filed a lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, alleging that he had previously, as attorney general, prosecuted her son and denied him a fair trial. However, she had to represent herself in the lawsuit as no lawyers in Singapore were willing to take on the case due to potential repercussions. The lawsuit was dismissed the day before Nagaenthran's execution, with the court criticizing it as baseless and an abuse of the legal process. Following the rejection, Nagaenthran was granted two hours to spend with his family in the Supreme Court building before being taken back to Changi Prison for his execution. Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil for Nagaenthran the night before his execution, with two Malaysian lawyers being questioned by the police for participating. Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution.
- The execution of Nagaenthran sparked criticism from various parties who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Australian lawyers, McMahon and Bailes, criticized the use of the death penalty for drug trafficking, stating that it doesn't deter the crime and that the masterminds behind it are not brought to justice. Bailes also emphasized the irreversibility of the death penalty once carried out. The case brought attention to past cases of Australians executed for drug offenses in Southeast Asian countries and Australia's opposition to the death penalty. The execution also raised concerns for nine remaining Malaysians on Singapore's death row and the United Nations urged Singapore to impose a moratorium on the death penalty. On the day of the execution, the Attorney-General's Chambers strongly condemned allegations against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, describing them as an abuse of court processes and contempt of court. The AGC and Central Narcotics Bureau later defended Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran.
- Following Nagaenthran's execution, Minister Faishal Ibrahim announced legislative changes to penalize abuse of court processes and highlighted the negative impact of drug abuse on individuals and society. During a BBC HARDtalk interview, Shanmugam defended the use of the death penalty as a means to protect Singaporeans and maintain a safe society, pointing to the decrease in drug-related arrests and the 2021 WHO report on drug abuse deaths. He also addressed concerns about the execution of Nagaenthran, stating that the courts found him not intellectually disabled and emphasized the severity of Southeast Asia's drug situation. In response to allegations of a climate of fear among lawyers, opposition parties wrote to the Law Minister expressing concerns and the Chief Justice called on lawyers to not engage in abusing court processes. Additionally, Nagaenthran's former lawyer, Violet Netto, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer without a valid practicing certificate during Nagaenthran's case and the appeals of two other death row inmates.
- Following Nagaenthran's case, Malaysia's human rights lawyer N. Surendran and Lawyers for Liberty argue that Nagaenthran did not receive a full due court process, as his intellectual and mental impairments were not considered during the proceedings. Human Rights Watch's senior disability rights expert, Emina Ćerimović, criticizes Nagaenthran's treatment as inhumane and disproportionate. Malaysia's Bar, Advocates Association of Sarawak, and Sabah Law Society urge Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence out of compassion and humanity, considering his mental state after 11 years on death row. Nagaenthran's family and lawyer M Ravi plan to sue Singapore's attorney general Lucien Wong for negligence and willful disregard of human life. The Malaysian King wrote to Singapore's President for clemency, but it was denied. Nagaenthran's lawyer, Violet Netto, sought an adjournment of the appeal, which was granted, and the case was heard on 1 March 2022. Netto argued for a psychiatric assessment of Nagaenthran's mental fitness prior to execution and tried to admit foreign psychologists' reports as evidence. The court criticized this as an abuse of the process, and the Deputy Public Prosecutor accused Netto of a cynical attempt to manipulate the court.

- Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness.
- Nagaenthran's lawyer, M Ravi, lacks medical expertise and his claim of Nagaenthran's mental age being below 18 is not supported medically. The prison officers who knew Nagaenthran did not observe any abnormal behavior from him. Nagaenthran was able to communicate and request for things, indicating mental competence. Nagaenthran tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the postponement of his execution. The prison staff and prisoners are being regularly tested for COVID-19. The case has sparked further debate on the death penalty in Malaysia, with most Malaysians supporting the death penalty for serious crimes.
- A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning.
- Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases.
- The execution of Nagaenthran, a Malaysian man convicted of drug trafficking in Singapore, was scheduled close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, causing criticism. Despite international and local pressure to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintained that Nagaenthran was accorded due process and was represented by legal counsel. They reiterated the final court verdict, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress and was mentally competent for execution.

Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution.
- Nagaenthran, despite his intellectual disability and mental illness, was denied re-sentencing and his clemency appeal was rejected in 2020, finalizing his death sentence. His case received international attention and sparked opposition to his execution due to his mental state. The Singapore government was urged to commute his sentence and grant clemency, with an online petition gaining over 102,000 signatures. The execution was scheduled for November 10, 2021, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
- The text discusses the impact of Nagaenthran's case on the debate around the death penalty in Malaysia, with many supporting its use for serious crimes like murder and drug trafficking. However, some legal professionals suggest giving judges discretion to impose life imprisonment in certain capital cases. The case has also sparked international attention, with the UN urging Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran. Singapore has defended its position, stating that every country has the right to decide on the use of the death penalty and the types of capital offenses defined under the law. The text also mentions that Nagaenthran, along with other prisoners, tested positive for COVID-19, and the authorities are taking measures to ensure regular testing of both prison staff and inmates. The Malaysian government has been urged to review its death penalty laws for drug traffickers, as there is growing pressure from human rights groups and the UN. Some critics argue that Nagaenthran was not given a full due court process, and his execution would be inhumane and disproportionate.
- After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.
- Following Nagaenthran's case, Malaysia's human rights lawyer N. Surendran and Lawyers for Liberty argue that Nagaenthran did not receive a full due court process, as his intellectual and mental impairments were not considered during the proceedings.

Nagaenthran's family and lawyer M Ravi plan to sue Singapore's attorney general Lucien Wong for negligence and willful disregard of human life. The Malaysian King wrote to Singapore's President for clemency, but it was denied. Nagaenthran's lawyer, Violet Netto, sought an adjournment of the appeal, which was granted, and the case was heard on 1 March 2022. Netto argued for a psychiatric assessment of Nagaenthran's mental fitness prior to execution and tried to admit foreign psychologists' reports as evidence. The court criticized this as an abuse of the process, and the Deputy Public Prosecutor accused Netto of a cynical attempt to manipulate the court.

- After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.
- After Nagaenthran's final appeal was heard on 1 March 2022, the court reserved judgment. Four weeks later, the appeal was dismissed, and the court criticized Nagaenthran's lawyers for abusing the court process. The court rejected evidence from two foreign psychologists and accepted that Nagaenthran had borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. Nagaenthran's lawyers had previously objected to the admission of psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021. Following the dismissal of the appeal, civil groups urged Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show mercy, with some accusing the government of violating international law. A protest was held at Hong Lim Park against the use of the death penalty. Nagaenthran's family and lawyers were reportedly devastated by the dismissal of the appeal, and his execution was set to be imminent.
- Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases.
- A candlelight vigil was organized at Hong Lim Park by rights activist Kokila Annamalai for Nagaenthran, whose execution is set for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's family, including his mother who filed a lawsuit against the Chief Justice, and British celebrities appealed for clemency. Human rights groups asked for Nagaenthran's transfer to a Malaysian prison. Protests intensified as another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, also received a finalized death warrant. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concern over the executions and urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty. A protest in Malaysia against Nagaenthran's execution led to three lawyers being taken into custody for questioning.
- The execution of Nagaenthran sparked criticism from various parties who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Australian lawyers, McMahon and Bailes, criticized the use of the death penalty for drug trafficking, stating that it doesn't deter the crime and that the masterminds behind it are not brought to justice. Bailes also emphasized the irreversibility of the death penalty once carried out. The case brought attention to past cases of Australians executed for drug offenses in Southeast Asian countries and Australia's opposition to the death penalty. The execution also raised concerns for nine remaining Malaysians on Singapore's death row and the United Nations urged Singapore to impose a moratorium on the death penalty. On the day of the execution, the Attorney-General's Chambers strongly condemned allegations against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, describing them as an abuse of court processes and contempt of court. The AGC and Central Narcotics Bureau later defended Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran.
- Nagaenthran's mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, filed a lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, alleging that he had previously, as attorney general, prosecuted her son and denied him a fair trial. However, she had to represent herself in the lawsuit as no lawyers in Singapore were willing to take on the case due to potential repercussions. The lawsuit was dismissed the day before Nagaenthran's execution, with the court criticizing it as baseless and an abuse of the legal process. Following the rejection, Nagaenthran was granted two hours to spend with his family in the Supreme Court building before being taken back to Changi Prison for his execution. Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil for Nagaenthran the night before his execution, with two Malaysian lawyers being questioned by the police for participating. Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution.
- Nagaenthran, despite his intellectual disability and mental illness, was denied re-sentencing and his clemency appeal was rejected in 2020, finalizing his death sentence. His case received international attention and sparked opposition to his execution due to his mental state. The Singapore government was urged to commute his sentence and grant clemency, with an online petition gaining over 102,000 signatures. The execution was scheduled for November 10, 2021, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
- After learning about Nagaenthran's death warrant, international and local human rights groups, including the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN Commission on Human Rights, urged the Singapore government to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence. An online petition gained over 102,000 signatures, and there were plans to bring the case to the International Court of Justice. Diplomats from the Malaysian embassy provided consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who were able to visit him in prison. Nagaenthran's mental state appeared to have deteriorated, with his brother and a neighboring death row inmate reporting erratic behavior. Amidst these concerns, the Malaysian government faced pressure to intervene, and the Ministry of Home Affairs released a statement addressing the situation. The execution date, close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, was also criticized.
- The execution of Nagaenthran, a Malaysian man convicted of drug trafficking in Singapore, was scheduled close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, causing criticism. Despite international and local pressure to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintained that Nagaenthran was accorded due process and was represented by legal counsel. They reiterated the final court verdict, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress and was mentally competent for execution. The Malaysian government, including the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, appealed to Singapore's leaders for leniency, while lawyers from Malaysia condemned Singapore's response and launched protests. The European Union also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran. However, a last-minute appeal was dismissed by the High Court, citing a lack of evidence to support claims of Nagaenthran's deteriorating mental state and no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law.
- Following Nagaenthran's execution, legal proceedings were initiated against his former lawyer, Violet Netto, for practicing without a valid certificate during his case and the appeals of two other death row inmates. Another lawyer, M Ravi, who also represented Nagaenthran, faced multiple professional disciplinary inquiries, contempt proceedings, and police investigations. Both lawyers were ordered to pay costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers for unnecessary expenses incurred during the case. Separately, activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated for organizing public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit. In response to the abuse of court processes in capital cases, the government passed a new law imposing strict regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, allowing only the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of execution and hear the applications. This law was supported by most, but criticized by Human Rights Watch for potentially cutting off inmates' chances to oppose their execution.
- After Nagaenthran's execution, the AGC and CNB defended the decision by emphasizing that Nagaenthran received a fair trial, exhausted all legal appeals, and knowingly committed the crime. They rejected claims of intellectual disability and misinformation regarding his mental state. The government received support for their decision and maintained that the use of the death penalty in Singapore follows due process and an impartial judiciary. In response to international criticism, Ambassador Bhatia highlighted Singapore's reputation for fairness and reiterated the country's sovereign right to determine its criminal justice system. Minister Faishal Ibrahim addressed domestic criticism by stressing respect for the law and announcing legislative changes to penalize abuse of court processes. He also highlighted the negative impact of drug abuse and the ongoing war on drugs in Singapore.

- Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness.
- After Nagaenthran's final appeal was heard on 1 March 2022, the court reserved judgment.

He attempted to argue for mercy based on intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but was dismissed by the High Court in 2017. In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal. Nagaenthran then appealed to the President of Singapore for clemency, but was rejected in 2020, finalizing his death sentence.

Amidst these concerns, the Malaysian government faced pressure to intervene, and the Ministry of Home Affairs released a statement addressing the situation. The execution date, close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, was also criticized.
- The execution of Nagaenthran sparked criticism from various parties who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Australian lawyers, McMahon and Bailes, criticized the use of the death penalty for drug trafficking, stating that it doesn't deter the crime and that the masterminds behind it are not brought to justice. Bailes also emphasized the irreversibility of the death penalty once carried out. The case brought attention to past cases of Australians executed for drug offenses in Southeast Asian countries and Australia's opposition to the death penalty. The execution also raised concerns for nine remaining Malaysians on Singapore's death row and the United Nations urged Singapore to impose a moratorium on the death penalty. On the day of the execution, the Attorney-General's Chambers strongly condemned allegations against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, describing them as an abuse of court processes and contempt of court. The AGC and Central Narcotics Bureau later defended Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran.
- After Nagaenthran's final appeal was heard on 1 March 2022, the court reserved judgment. Four weeks later, the appeal was dismissed, and the court criticized Nagaenthran's lawyers for abusing the court process. The court rejected evidence from two foreign psychologists and accepted that Nagaenthran had borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. Nagaenthran's lawyers had previously objected to the admission of psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021. Following the dismissal of the appeal, civil groups urged Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show mercy, with some accusing the government of violating international law. A protest was held at Hong Lim Park against the use of the death penalty. Nagaenthran's family and lawyers were reportedly devastated by the dismissal of the appeal, and his execution was set to be imminent.
- Following Nagaenthran's case, Malaysia's human rights lawyer N. Surendran and Lawyers for Liberty argue that Nagaenthran did not receive a full due court process, as his intellectual and mental impairments were not considered during the proceedings. Human Rights Watch's senior disability rights expert, Emina Ćerimović, criticizes Nagaenthran's treatment as inhumane and disproportionate. Malaysia's Bar, Advocates Association of Sarawak, and Sabah Law Society urge Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence out of compassion and humanity, considering his mental state after 11 years on death row. Nagaenthran's family and lawyer M Ravi plan to sue Singapore's attorney general Lucien Wong for negligence and willful disregard of human life. The Malaysian King wrote to Singapore's President for clemency, but it was denied. Nagaenthran's lawyer, Violet Netto, sought an adjournment of the appeal, which was granted, and the case was heard on 1 March 2022. Netto argued for a psychiatric assessment of Nagaenthran's mental fitness prior to execution and tried to admit foreign psychologists' reports as evidence. The court criticized this as an abuse of the process, and the Deputy Public Prosecutor accused Netto of a cynical attempt to manipulate the court.
- The execution of Nagaenthran, a Malaysian man convicted of drug trafficking in Singapore, was scheduled close to the Hindu festival Deepavali, causing criticism. Despite international and local pressure to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintained that Nagaenthran was accorded due process and was represented by legal counsel. They reiterated the final court verdict, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress and was mentally competent for execution. The Malaysian government, including the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, appealed to Singapore's leaders for leniency, while lawyers from Malaysia condemned Singapore's response and launched protests. The European Union also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran. However, a last-minute appeal was dismissed by the High Court, citing a lack of evidence to support claims of Nagaenthran's deteriorating mental state and no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law.

A protest was held at Hong Lim Park against the use of the death penalty. Nagaenthran's family and lawyers were reportedly devastated by the dismissal of the appeal, and his execution was set to be imminent.
- Following Nagaenthran's execution, legal proceedings were initiated against his former lawyer, Violet Netto, for practicing without a valid certificate during his case and the appeals of two other death row inmates. Another lawyer, M Ravi, who also represented Nagaenthran, faced multiple professional disciplinary inquiries, contempt proceedings, and police investigations. Both lawyers were ordered to pay costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers for unnecessary expenses incurred during the case. Separately, activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated for organizing public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit. In response to the abuse of court processes in capital cases, the government passed a new law imposing strict regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, allowing only the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of execution and hear the applications. This law was supported by most, but criticized by Human Rights Watch for potentially cutting off inmates' chances to oppose their execution.
- After Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, civil groups and Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) accused Singapore of violating international law and called for the Malaysian government to bring his case to the International Court of Justice. The Global Commission on Drug Policy criticized the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in ASEAN member nations. Some Singaporeans support Nagaenthran's execution, while others believe he should be spared and the death penalty should be removed. A second clemency appeal was rejected, and Nagaenthran's execution is scheduled for 27 April 2022. Nagaenthran's mother has made a public apology and begged for mercy, and Amnesty International has filed a petition with over 8,000 signatures seeking clemency. Celebrities and rights activists have also appealed for Nagaenthran's sentence to be commuted.
- After Nagaenthran's execution, the AGC and CNB defended the decision by emphasizing that Nagaenthran received a fair trial, exhausted all legal appeals, and knowingly committed the crime. They rejected claims of intellectual disability and misinformation regarding his mental state. The government received support for their decision and maintained that the use of the death penalty in Singapore follows due process and an impartial judiciary. In response to international criticism, Ambassador Bhatia highlighted Singapore's reputation for fairness and reiterated the country's sovereign right to determine its criminal justice system. Minister Faishal Ibrahim addressed domestic criticism by stressing respect for the law and announcing legislative changes to penalize abuse of court processes. He also highlighted the negative impact of drug abuse and the ongoing war on drugs in Singapore.
- Nagaenthran's mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, filed a lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, alleging that he had previously, as attorney general, prosecuted her son and denied him a fair trial. However, she had to represent herself in the lawsuit as no lawyers in Singapore were willing to take on the case due to potential repercussions. The lawsuit was dismissed the day before Nagaenthran's execution, with the court criticizing it as baseless and an abuse of the legal process. Following the rejection, Nagaenthran was granted two hours to spend with his family in the Supreme Court building before being taken back to Changi Prison for his execution. Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil for Nagaenthran the night before his execution, with two Malaysian lawyers being questioned by the police for participating. Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations after his execution.
- Following Nagaenthran's execution, Minister Faishal Ibrahim announced legislative changes to penalize abuse of court processes and highlighted the negative impact of drug abuse on individuals and society. During a BBC HARDtalk interview, Shanmugam defended the use of the death penalty as a means to protect Singaporeans and maintain a safe society, pointing to the decrease in drug-related arrests and the 2021 WHO report on drug abuse deaths. He also addressed concerns about the execution of Nagaenthran, stating that the courts found him not intellectually disabled and emphasized the severity of Southeast Asia's drug situation. In response to allegations of a climate of fear among lawyers, opposition parties wrote to the Law Minister expressing concerns and the Chief Justice called on lawyers to not engage in abusing court processes. Additionally, Nagaenthran's former lawyer, Violet Netto, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer without a valid practicing certificate during Nagaenthran's case and the appeals of two other death row inmates.

- The text discusses the impact of Nagaenthran's case on the debate around the death penalty in Malaysia, with many supporting its use for serious crimes like murder and drug trafficking. However, some legal professionals suggest giving judges discretion to impose life imprisonment in certain capital cases. The case has also sparked international attention, with the UN urging Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran. Singapore has defended its position, stating that every country has the right to decide on the use of the death penalty and the types of capital offenses defined under the law. The text also mentions that Nagaenthran, along with other prisoners, tested positive for COVID-19, and the authorities are taking measures to ensure regular testing of both prison staff and inmates. The Malaysian government has been urged to review its death penalty laws for drug traffickers, as there is growing pressure from human rights groups and the UN. Some critics argue that Nagaenthran was not given a full due court process, and his execution would be inhumane and disproportionate.

- Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian born in Ipoh in 1988, was the second of four children. He was raised primarily by his grandmother and relatives while his mother worked. After completing secondary school, Nagaenthran worked in a factory before moving to Singapore for work against his family's wishes. In 2009, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for carrying drugs and was sentenced to death for trafficking. He claimed he was coerced, but the court rejected his defense. In 2012, Singapore amended its death penalty laws, allowing for life imprisonment and caning if the offender provides substantial assistance to disrupt drug trafficking or has diminished responsibility due to mental illness. Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing in 2013 due to clinical intellectual disability and mental illness.
- Nagaenthran, despite his intellectual disability and mental illness, was denied re-sentencing and his clemency appeal was rejected in 2020, finalizing his death sentence. His case received international attention and sparked opposition to his execution due to his mental state.

- Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, after being on death row for 13 years for drug trafficking. He was the second prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His family, who were dissatisfied with the sentence, took his body to Ipoh, Malaysia, for funeral preparations. The execution sparked criticism from human rights activists, politicians, and foreign governments, who called for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Critics described the execution as a miscarriage of justice, ineffective in preventing drug trafficking, and a violation of international law. They also criticized the lack of compassion and mercy shown by the Singapore government. Australian lawyers who had represented other drug traffickers also spoke up against the use of the death penalty in such cases.
- After learning about Nagaenthran's death warrant, international and local human rights groups, including the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN Commission on Human Rights, urged the Singapore government to grant clemency due to his mental disability and potential innocence.

- The Metropolitan Cattle Market was relocated to a new site in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues at the Smithfield location. The new market, located on a former royal dockyard in Deptford, was built to accommodate increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. The market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once, with three large piers for disembarking animals. The site, which originally covered 22 acres and was later expanded to 30 acres, had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market was opened in 1872 and most livestock was slaughtered at the Deptford market by 1880. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall and included services such as bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and a pub. Trading was done through private bargain and the buyers were mainly wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. The market handled a significant portion of London's live cattle trade, with the largest number of cattle ever landed in one year being 224,831 (1897) and the largest number of sheep being 783,440 (1882).
- The main cattle market in London was historically located at Smithfield, but due to overcrowding and public health issues, it was moved to a new site in Islington called the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the mid-19th century. This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle.
- The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues. The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered animals for buyers within 10 days, and most of the meat was resold at Smithfield. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. In the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers bypassed the marketing system by taking advantage of a regulations loophole. The market slaughtered 16.5 million animals in total. Cattle boats from the Continent arrived at Deptford on Sundays and Wednesdays, and the market purchased three paddle steamers to convey more than 1.6 million animals. Animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon upon landing, and hides, horns, fleeces, and offal were disinfected. The market's employment conditions were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth, who found that the market had about 110 direct employees and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and had irregular hours and precarious employment.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London underwent significant changes, including the appointment of a new superintendent, George Philcox, who led the market for 40 years until his death in 1912. The market employed about 110 direct workers and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who faced irregular hours and precarious employment due to the market's dependence on ship arrivals and changing animal disease regulations. Drovers, who were mostly former "ochre boys," were paid per vessel and could earn high wages, while slaughtermen earned high wages but faced brutalizing working conditions and long hours. Women, known as "gut girls," were employed to clean cattle and sheep intestines, a job that was originally done by men but was assigned to women after a strike for higher pay. The working conditions for these women were described as unpleasant and odorous.
- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw significant changes with the addition of women workers, known as "gut girls," who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. However, after Queen Victoria took an interest in their working conditions and the discovery of outside entrails being processed, the market banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

Forrest Capie and Richard Perren noted that although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were just terminal stations of a great network of German railway lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before reaching their port of embarkation. Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.

The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s, after the British authorities realized that too much livestock was coming from places where disease was endemic. The United States had become the main supplier, with nearly all American livestock exports going to England. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West, where early Western cattle, though hardy, made tough eating. American shippers exported their best animals, as they were better able to absorb the cost of carriage. Western cattlemen improved their stock to capture lucrative markets, and the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle. The Hereford bull, in particular, increased the size and quality of range cattle. Comparable improvements were made in sheep. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. The transportation of livestock from the American West to Deptford market was made possible by the advancements in technology and logistics, with a 1,200 pounds steer being conveyed for £10 or £12, which
- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw a shift from European to American livestock suppliers due to disease concerns. The American West, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, became the primary source of cattle, accounting for 95% of exports by 1884. Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for £10 or £12. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits. Canadian Pacific Railway facilitated cattle exports from Alberta and Assiniboia, while the Argentine beef industry transformed into a major exporter due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. From 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced a shift in livestock suppliers as the North American surplus decreased and Argentina became the primary source due to their advanced beef industry. However, the live meat trade faced challenges, including high mortality rates during transportation and the Beef Trust's control over the business, which impacted the market negatively. Animal welfare was also a concern due to the long and difficult journeys. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford. The Beef Trust maintained control over the North Atlantic meat trade but had limited influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

The text also mentions that the Beef Trust sent meat directly to Smithfield Market, causing market days at Deptford to be cancelled due to lack of support. An inquiry was set up to investigate the control and effect of meat supply, distribution, and price in the United Kingdom, which reported in 1909 and found the allegations to be generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef. Animal welfare during transportation was also a significant issue, with animals experiencing stress and injury, even in current times. In the early days of shipping cattle across the Atlantic, conditions were poor, especially in tramp steamers, and animals suffered from jettisoning or dying from injury or suffocation. Samuel Plimsoll campaigned against the transatlantic cattle trade, citing the danger and cruelty to animals and the instability of cattle ships in stormy weather.

The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered animals for buyers within 10 days, and most of the meat was resold at Smithfield. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. In the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers bypassed the marketing system by taking advantage of a regulations loophole. The market slaughtered 16.5 million animals in total. Cattle boats from the Continent arrived at Deptford on Sundays and Wednesdays, and the market purchased three paddle steamers to convey more than 1.6 million animals. Animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon upon landing, and hides, horns, fleeces, and offal were disinfected. The market's employment conditions were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth, who found that the market had about 110 direct employees and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and had irregular hours and precarious employment.
- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw significant changes with the addition of women workers, known as "gut girls," who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. However, after Queen Victoria took an interest in their working conditions and the discovery of outside entrails being processed, the market banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

Forrest Capie and Richard Perren noted that although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were just terminal stations of a great network of German railway lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before reaching their port of embarkation. Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.

The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s, after the British authorities realized that too much livestock was coming from places where disease was endemic. The United States had become the main supplier, with nearly all American livestock exports going to England. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West, where early Western cattle, though hardy, made tough eating. American shippers exported their best animals, as they were better able to absorb the cost of carriage. Western cattlemen improved their stock to capture lucrative markets, and the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle. The Hereford bull, in particular, increased the size and quality of range cattle. Comparable improvements were made in sheep. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. The transportation of livestock from the American West to Deptford market was made possible by the advancements in technology and logistics, with a 1,200 pounds steer being conveyed for £10 or £12, which

The market employed about 110 direct workers and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who faced irregular hours and precarious employment due to the market's dependence on ship arrivals and changing animal disease regulations. Drovers, who were mostly former "ochre boys," were paid per vessel and could earn high wages, while slaughtermen earned high wages but faced brutalizing working conditions and long hours. Women, known as "gut girls," were employed to clean cattle and sheep intestines, a job that was originally done by men but was assigned to women after a strike for higher pay. The working conditions for these women were described as unpleasant and odorous.
- During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the live cattle trade, dominated by traders prioritizing profit over animal welfare, faced criticism from Samuel Plimsoll. The trade, which shipped animals from the US, Canada to Britain, involved harsh conditions and lengthy journeys resulting in injured and deceased animals. Plimsoll advocated for abolition, but his campaign led to improved regulations instead. In Canada, the trade was described as wasteful and unprofitable, with animals arriving in poor condition. Plimsoll argued that the trade had no rational commercial purpose, as imported beef could be cheaper, easier, and in better condition. An alternative was American chilled meat, which was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Despite being cheaper, American chilled beef sold at a premium due to potential fraud and consumer prejudice. Plimsoll maintained that chilled meat was as good as, if not better than, Deptford-killed beef. Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. However, once cold-storage was available, chilled meat could be kept for an additional 14 days, and livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival. The chilled trade was also larger, making the live animal trade less appealing.

However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865.

- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced a shift in livestock suppliers as the North American surplus decreased and Argentina became the primary source due to their advanced beef industry. However, the live meat trade faced challenges, including high mortality rates during transportation and the Beef Trust's control over the business, which impacted the market negatively. Animal welfare was also a concern due to the long and difficult journeys. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford. The Beef Trust maintained control over the North Atlantic meat trade but had limited influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

The text also mentions that the Beef Trust sent meat directly to Smithfield Market, causing market days at Deptford to be cancelled due to lack of support. An inquiry was set up to investigate the control and effect of meat supply, distribution, and price in the United Kingdom, which reported in 1909 and found the allegations to be generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef. Animal welfare during transportation was also a significant issue, with animals experiencing stress and injury, even in current times. In the early days of shipping cattle across the Atlantic, conditions were poor, especially in tramp steamers, and animals suffered from jettisoning or dying from injury or suffocation. Samuel Plimsoll campaigned against the transatlantic cattle trade, citing the danger and cruelty to animals and the instability of cattle ships in stormy weather.

- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw a shift from European to American livestock suppliers due to disease concerns. The American West, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, became the primary source of cattle, accounting for 95% of exports by 1884. Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for £10 or £12. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits. Canadian Pacific Railway facilitated cattle exports from Alberta and Assiniboia, while the Argentine beef industry transformed into a major exporter due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. From 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.
- The main cattle market in London was historically located at Smithfield, but due to overcrowding and public health issues, it was moved to a new site in Islington called the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the mid-19th century. This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced significant changes in its livestock suppliers. As the North American surplus decreased, Argentina became the primary source of animals, surpassing Europe. This shift was due to the Argentine beef industry's transformation, which involved selective breeding and the introduction of alfalfa forage, resulting in high-quality cattle. From around 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.

However, the live meat trade faced challenges. The journey was long and difficult, causing significant losses during transportation. In 1895, the Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, resulted in only 32 animals arriving alive, leading to the vessel being prohibited from carrying live stock for a year. Additionally, the Beef Trust, a cartel of large Chicago meat packers, controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America by the early 20th century. They were accused of buying up shops in Smithfield Market, fixing British beef prices, and controlling lairages at Deptford Market, which negatively impacted the market.

Animal welfare during these journeys was also a concern. "Wild, untamed brutes" struggled with the sea voyage and had to be tamed and taught to eat hay in advance. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of good chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford.

The Australasian live trade also suffered from "terrible" losses, with 607 cattle and 57 sheep lost out of the total shipped. Despite these challenges, the Beef Trust maintained its control over the North Atlantic meat trade, but its influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.
- The Metropolitan Cattle Market was relocated to a new site in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues at the Smithfield location. The new market, located on a former royal dockyard in Deptford, was built to accommodate increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. The market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once, with three large piers for disembarking animals. The site, which originally covered 22 acres and was later expanded to 30 acres, had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market was opened in 1872 and most livestock was slaughtered at the Deptford market by 1880. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall and included services such as bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and a pub. Trading was done through private bargain and the buyers were mainly wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. The market handled a significant portion of London's live cattle trade, with the largest number of cattle ever landed in one year being 224,831 (1897) and the largest number of sheep being 783,440 (1882).

- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw a shift from European to American livestock suppliers due to disease concerns. The American West, particularly Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, became the primary source of cattle, accounting for 95% of exports by 1884. Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for £10 or £12. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits. Canadian Pacific Railway facilitated cattle exports from Alberta and Assiniboia, while the Argentine beef industry transformed into a major exporter due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. From 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.
- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw significant changes with the addition of women workers, known as "gut girls," who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. However, after Queen Victoria took an interest in their working conditions and the discovery of outside entrails being processed, the market banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

Forrest Capie and Richard Perren noted that although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were just terminal stations of a great network of German railway lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before reaching their port of embarkation. Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.

The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s, after the British authorities realized that too much livestock was coming from places where disease was endemic. The United States had become the main supplier, with nearly all American livestock exports going to England. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West, where early Western cattle, though hardy, made tough eating.

- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced significant changes in its livestock suppliers. As the North American surplus decreased, Argentina became the primary source of animals, surpassing Europe. This shift was due to the Argentine beef industry's transformation, which involved selective breeding and the introduction of alfalfa forage, resulting in high-quality cattle. From around 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.

However, the live meat trade faced challenges. The journey was long and difficult, causing significant losses during transportation. In 1895, the Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, resulted in only 32 animals arriving alive, leading to the vessel being prohibited from carrying live stock for a year. Additionally, the Beef Trust, a cartel of large Chicago meat packers, controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America by the early 20th century. They were accused of buying up shops in Smithfield Market, fixing British beef prices, and controlling lairages at Deptford Market, which negatively impacted the market.

Animal welfare during these journeys was also a concern. "Wild, untamed brutes" struggled with the sea voyage and had to be tamed and taught to eat hay in advance. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of good chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford.

The Australasian live trade also suffered from "terrible" losses, with 607 cattle and 57 sheep lost out of the total shipped. Despite these challenges, the Beef Trust maintained its control over the North Atlantic meat trade, but its influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cattle trade, dominated by the Beef Trust, involved transporting animals from the US and Canada to Britain. The journey included travel by train, often for over 28 hours without proper rest, food, or water, and by ship, where animals faced harsh conditions such as freezing seawater and overcrowding. Plimsoll criticized the trade for its dangers and cruelty, and while his campaign for abolition was unsuccessful, it led to improvements in British and American regulations. A government inquiry confirmed Plimsoll's allegations of poor treatment of animals. The trade's primary purpose, according to Plimsoll, was to enrich dishonest traders, rather than serving a rational commercial purpose.
- The text is a collection of reports, articles, and books related to the meat and livestock industry, covering various topics such as the transatlantic cattle trade, regulations, diseases, and transportation. Some specific examples include the economic effects of cattle disease in Britain, the origins of ranching in western Canada, and the 28-hour law regulating the interstate transportation of live stock. The time period covered spans from the late 1800s to the early 1900s, with a few more recent sources. The documents also include primary sources such as "Deptford Live-Stock Reports" and "The Sinews of the Nation" by Charles Dickens.
- During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Samuel Plimsoll advocated for the abolition of the live cattle trade due to poor animal welfare conditions and lack of commercial purpose. However, his campaign led to improved regulations instead. Critics like Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade persisted due to the perceived riskiness of the chilled meat trade. Despite potential fraud and consumer prejudice, American chilled beef was commercially successful and less expensive to transport. Plimsoll argued that customers should have the right to choose between chilled and British-grown beef. Perren acknowledged that fraud existed in the chilled meat trade, with some butchers selling Deptford-killed meat as English for a higher price. However, effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933. The transatlantic cattle trade led to cheaper bread due to the need for ballast in vessels carrying cattle, which was often filled with American grain. Ultimately, the live cattle trade declined due to an embargo on Argentine cattle and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, leading to the closure of the Foreign Cattle Market in 1913.

The text also mentions that the Beef Trust sent meat directly to Smithfield Market, causing market days at Deptford to be cancelled due to lack of support. An inquiry was set up to investigate the control and effect of meat supply, distribution, and price in the United Kingdom, which reported in 1909 and found the allegations to be generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef. Animal welfare during transportation was also a significant issue, with animals experiencing stress and injury, even in current times. In the early days of shipping cattle across the Atlantic, conditions were poor, especially in tramp steamers, and animals suffered from jettisoning or dying from injury or suffocation. Samuel Plimsoll campaigned against the transatlantic cattle trade, citing the danger and cruelty to animals and the instability of cattle ships in stormy weather.

- The main cattle market in London was historically located at Smithfield, but due to overcrowding and public health issues, it was moved to a new site in Islington called the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the mid-19th century. This market received livestock from various parts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, due to increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. However, the lack of regulation led to the spread of diseases, such as rinderpest, which caused a major epidemic in 1865. In response, new laws were implemented, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, to be used exclusively for imported animals. This market was required to operate under quarantine conditions and was located on the Thames in Deptford, with three large piers for disembarking cattle.

The new market, located on a former royal dockyard in Deptford, was built to accommodate increasing demand for meat and the repeal of duties on foreign cattle. The market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once, with three large piers for disembarking animals. The site, which originally covered 22 acres and was later expanded to 30 acres, had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market was opened in 1872 and most livestock was slaughtered at the Deptford market by 1880. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall and included services such as bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and a pub. Trading was done through private bargain and the buyers were mainly wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. The market handled a significant portion of London's live cattle trade, with the largest number of cattle ever landed in one year being 224,831 (1897) and the largest number of sheep being 783,440 (1882).
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London underwent significant changes, including the appointment of a new superintendent, George Philcox, who led the market for 40 years until his death in 1912. The market employed about 110 direct workers and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who faced irregular hours and precarious employment due to the market's dependence on ship arrivals and changing animal disease regulations. Drovers, who were mostly former "ochre boys," were paid per vessel and could earn high wages, while slaughtermen earned high wages but faced brutalizing working conditions and long hours. Women, known as "gut girls," were employed to clean cattle and sheep intestines, a job that was originally done by men but was assigned to women after a strike for higher pay. The working conditions for these women were described as unpleasant and odorous.

Plimsoll called for the abolition of the trade. Although his campaign was unsuccessful, it led to some improvements in British and American regulations. The cattle trade was dominated by the Beef Trust, which established a liner system for regular and coordinated shipments.

- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced a shift in livestock suppliers as the North American surplus decreased and Argentina became the primary source due to their advanced beef industry. However, the live meat trade faced challenges, including high mortality rates during transportation and the Beef Trust's control over the business, which impacted the market negatively. Animal welfare was also a concern due to the long and difficult journeys. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford. The Beef Trust maintained control over the North Atlantic meat trade but had limited influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

The text also mentions that the Beef Trust sent meat directly to Smithfield Market, causing market days at Deptford to be cancelled due to lack of support. An inquiry was set up to investigate the control and effect of meat supply, distribution, and price in the United Kingdom, which reported in 1909 and found the allegations to be generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef. Animal welfare during transportation was also a significant issue, with animals experiencing stress and injury, even in current times. In the early days of shipping cattle across the Atlantic, conditions were poor, especially in tramp steamers, and animals suffered from jettisoning or dying from injury or suffocation. Samuel Plimsoll campaigned against the transatlantic cattle trade, citing the danger and cruelty to animals and the instability of cattle ships in stormy weather.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London experienced significant changes in its livestock suppliers. As the North American surplus decreased, Argentina became the primary source of animals, surpassing Europe. This shift was due to the Argentine beef industry's transformation, which involved selective breeding and the introduction of alfalfa forage, resulting in high-quality cattle. From around 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.

However, the live meat trade faced challenges. The journey was long and difficult, causing significant losses during transportation. In 1895, the Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, resulted in only 32 animals arriving alive, leading to the vessel being prohibited from carrying live stock for a year. Additionally, the Beef Trust, a cartel of large Chicago meat packers, controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America by the early 20th century. They were accused of buying up shops in Smithfield Market, fixing British beef prices, and controlling lairages at Deptford Market, which negatively impacted the market.

Animal welfare during these journeys was also a concern. "Wild, untamed brutes" struggled with the sea voyage and had to be tamed and taught to eat hay in advance. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of good chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford.

The Australasian live trade also suffered from "terrible" losses, with 607 cattle and 57 sheep lost out of the total shipped. Despite these challenges, the Beef Trust maintained its control over the North Atlantic meat trade, but its influence on fixing the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and increasing shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.
- The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington called the Foreign Cattle Market in the mid-19th century due to overcrowding and public health issues. The new market, built to accommodate increasing demand for meat, could handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered animals for buyers within 10 days, and most of the meat was resold at Smithfield. By the end of 1887, over 9 million animals had been landed at Deptford. In the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers bypassed the marketing system by taking advantage of a regulations loophole. The market slaughtered 16.5 million animals in total. Cattle boats from the Continent arrived at Deptford on Sundays and Wednesdays, and the market purchased three paddle steamers to convey more than 1.6 million animals. Animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon upon landing, and hides, horns, fleeces, and offal were disinfected. The market's employment conditions were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth, who found that the market had about 110 direct employees and 1,500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and had irregular hours and precarious employment.
- In the late 19th century, the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market in London saw significant changes with the addition of women workers, known as "gut girls," who cleaned cattle and sheep intestines for sausage skins and condoms. However, after Queen Victoria took an interest in their working conditions and the discovery of outside entrails being processed, the market banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.

Forrest Capie and Richard Perren noted that although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were just terminal stations of a great network of German railway lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before reaching their port of embarkation. Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.

The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s, after the British authorities realized that too much livestock was coming from places where disease was endemic. The United States had become the main supplier, with nearly all American livestock exports going to England. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West, where early Western cattle, though hardy, made tough eating. American shippers exported their best animals, as they were better able to absorb the cost of carriage. Western cattlemen improved their stock to capture lucrative markets, and the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle. The Hereford bull, in particular, increased the size and quality of range cattle. Comparable improvements were made in sheep. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. The transportation of livestock from the American West to Deptford market was made possible by the advancements in technology and logistics, with a 1,200 pounds steer being conveyed for £10 or £12, which

## question

How did Youngkin deal with LGBTQ+ rights and policy issues in Virginia?

## ground_truth

He legally supports the LGBT community, but he personally cannot accept it.

## generated_answer

 Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports it legally, hosted a private Pride event without inviting LGBTQ+ legislators, declined to issue a Pride Month proclamation, and proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, which would make Virginia the only US state with misdemeanor penalties for exceeding the legal amount. After announcing replacement policies regarding transgender students' rights in schools, most Virginia school districts had not adopted them, with some refusing due to belief of violation of state law. Thousands of students protested by walking out of school in response.

- Youngkin's environmental and energy actions include withdrawing from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, proposing a nuclear reactor, and altering the permit-issuing process, which was criticized by environmental groups. He vetoed healthcare bills, contradicting national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation. In education, he reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges, facing criticism for pitting student groups against each other. Regarding LGBTQ+ rights, Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports it legally, and he hosted a private Pride event without inviting LGBTQ+ legislators, which was boycotted. He also declined to issue a Pride Month proclamation. In response to the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade, Youngkin refused to discuss hypotheticals regarding Obergefell v. Hodges. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, which would make Virginia the only US state with misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount.
- After the replacement policies regarding transgender students' rights in schools were announced by the Youngkin administration, most Virginia school districts had not adopted them, with some refusing due to belief of violation of state law. Critics argue that the policies may not meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill, and may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act and a 2020 court ruling. Shortly after the policies were announced, thousands of students protested by walking out of school.

In terms of education budget, both Youngkin and McAuliffe campaigned on increasing the budget, but Youngkin's platform was criticized for lacking details and focusing more on cultural issues. After taking office, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a record-breaking biennial state budget that allocated $19.2 billion to education, exceeding the amount that Republicans had initially wanted. The budget included a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years, one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers, and $1.25 billion for school construction and maintenance. The Virginia Preschool Initiative was also expanded.
- Youngkin's administration has taken a firm stance against hypotheticals, as seen in his response regarding the potential reversal of the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, making Virginia the only state with misdemeanor penalties for exceeding the legal amount. This proposal was influenced by a 2021 recommendation from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. In voting rights, Youngkin has continued restoring rights to former felons, but an automatic restoration amendment failed due to Republican opposition. Youngkin also campaigned for various candidates in the 2022 federal midterms, including those who embraced false claims about the 2020 election, which drew criticism from moderate Republicans. Regarding former Maine governor Paul LePage, who is known for racist comments, Youngkin initially claimed ignorance of the situation.
- Youngkin's education platform was a major focus of his campaign, with an emphasis on parental involvement and opposition to supposed critical race theory teaching, even though fact-checkers found no evidence of it in state curriculum standards. He also opposed transgender student protections and planned to repeal related policies. His first official action as governor was to ban critical race theory in schools and related materials, and cancel the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to decrease suspension rates for Black students, promote cultural competency, and close the racial achievement gap. However, critics claimed the math initiative would have "dumbed down" standards and eliminated advanced high school math classes, though officials denied this. Youngkin also expressed intentions to address collective bargaining rights for public employees and project labor agreements.
- After his election, Youngkin took several actions related to the environment and energy. He withdrew Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, calling it a "carbon tax," and proposed building a small modular nuclear reactor in Southwest Virginia. He also reevaluated Virginia's membership in the initiative due to potential legal limitations. Youngkin called for better protection against pollution, support for cleaning the Chesapeake Bay, and establishing a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat sea-level rise. However, he opposed a bill aimed at improving flood preparedness and attempted to rescind a ban on single-use plastics, which environmental groups criticized. Youngkin also revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects, transferring authority from citizen review boards to the Department of Environmental Quality. In 2022, Youngkin vetoed bills related to health care, such as setting a statute of limitations on medical debt collection and prohibiting health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use, despite broad bipartisan support. His vetoes contradicted national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation.
- After being elected, Youngkin established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools, which was criticized for being divisive, authoritarian, and unfairly targeting educators. It was part of a broader push to address critical race theory in the state's curriculum, but a signed bill had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law. The administration received criticism for not responding to inquiries about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used and denying FOIA requests. The tipline was closed down in September 2022 due to a lack of tips.

Youngkin attempted to amend a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board, aiming to hold the board accountable for their handling of sexual assault cases in the school system. However, the amendment was not successful. The amendment was criticized as an attempt to subvert the election results and an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.

In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools, established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. The new policies require student-access to school facilities and programs to be determined by biological sex, and mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender. The policies also mandate that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun. These actions are expected to face court challenges as several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill.
- Glenn Youngkin, Virginia's new governor, faced criticism from the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and educators for his stance on critical race theory, viewing its ban as an attempt to "whitewash" history and "erase black history." His first-day executive actions included rescinding COVID-19 regulations, such as mask mandates in schools and the vaccine mandate for state employees. He also ordered a reevaluation of workplace safety standards and fired the entire Virginia Parole Board. Youngkin's executive actions have been considered more polarizing than those of his predecessors, with two lawsuits brought against his executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia. A federal judge later ruled that school districts in Virginia could choose to require masking in areas frequented by certain plaintiffs.
- Youngkin has taken a firm stance against hypotheticals and demonstrated flexibility on controversial issues, such as supporting a candidate with a history of racist comments. His refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his party has received criticism. After Nancy Pelosi's husband was assaulted, Youngkin made a controversial comment that was criticized for its insensitivity. He later apologized for his rhetoric in a letter to Pelosi. Youngkin's actions have been noted to not always align with his espoused Christian values, contributing to a devolved state of political discourse. His approval rating among Virginians is not specified in the text.
- Youngkin advocates for private businesses to partner with lab schools and supports legislation that prioritizes applications from historically black colleges or universities and underserved communities. He proposed redirecting per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools, but the proposal was not adopted. In 2022, Youngkin signed laws allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, mandating digital floor plans for public schools, requiring the reporting of certain misdemeanor crimes committed by students on school grounds, and implementing measures to prevent hazing in colleges and universities. Regarding climate change, Youngkin is unclear about its cause but supports adaptation efforts and an "all of the above approach" to energy. He has withdrawn Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, citing cost savings for ratepayers, despite potential revenue loss for the state.
- Youngkin, upon becoming governor, banned critical race theory in schools and canceled the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to shift focus to data science and analytics while still offering calculus. Critics, including education officials, disputed claims that the initiative would "dumb down" standards or eliminate advanced math classes. Later, Youngkin signed a bill allowing parents to review and opt out of material with "sexually explicit content," and urged colleges to consider political diversity in hiring. He also enlisted a conservative think tank to assist in revising history and social sciences standards, and advocated for a bill to reverse admissions process reforms aimed at increasing diversity at two Governor's Schools. Additionally, he established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools.
- Youngkin made changes to FOIA law regarding the release of files related to closed investigations and vetoed a bill related to civilian oversight boards. He also signed a Marcus alert system bill, a ban on law enforcement quotas, and limited an early release program for inmates. A bill proposed by the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which bans using the number of arrests or summonses as the sole criterion for evaluating law-enforcement officers, was supported by both parties and signed into law. Youngkin introduced a budget amendment making inmates convicted of violent crimes ineligible for an expanded early release program. During his campaign, Youngkin proposed eliminating Virginia's individual income tax, but later retracted it and announced more modest tax cut proposals, which would amount to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts.

- Youngkin made changes to Virginia's FOIA law, giving law enforcement discretion to release files related to closed investigations, but requiring victim notification and opportunity to object before release. He vetoed a bill that would have allowed the Arlington County Board to hire a local auditor of police misconduct, expressing displeasure with civilian oversight boards. A Marcus alert system bill was signed, exempting localities with populations under 40,000 from adopting the system due to cost concerns. Youngkin also signed a bill banning law enforcement quotas for ticket-writing or arrests and limited an early release program for inmates.

- In February 2022, Youngkin's administration successfully revoked Virginia's COVID-19 workplace safety standards, initially adopted by Northam's administration, following the rejection of two board appointees by House Republicans. The standards, which included a mask mandate for high-risk indoor areas, officially ended in March. In January, the Virginia Department of Health, under Youngkin's authority, ceased contact tracing efforts due to the challenges posed by the Omicron variant. In May, Youngkin announced a new telework policy for executive branch employees, limiting telework to one day a week or with higher-level approvals, impacting state employees and potentially conflicting with private sector trends. Additionally, in 2022, Youngkin signed a bill restoring law enforcement discretion over releasing files related to closed investigations under the Freedom of Information Act, requiring victim notification and opportunity to object before releasing such files.

- Youngkin's appointment of Andrew Wheeler as senior advisor and then director of the Office of Regulatory Management, after his nomination as Secretary of Natural Resources was rejected, did not require legislative approval. This appointment led to a dispute where Republicans, with Youngkin's support, initially planned to reject 1,000 of Northam's appointees, but later scaled it back to eleven. Democrats retaliated by rejecting some of Youngkin's nominees. Conflict escalated throughout the 2022 legislative session, resulting in Youngkin issuing more vetoes than his predecessors, mainly on bills sponsored by Democrats. The Youngkin administration also faced scrutiny for using Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne as unpaid advisors, presenting a possible conflict of interest. Moran, while serving as Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs, was on paid leave from two political consulting firms. Layne served as an unpaid advisor while working as an executive at Sentara Healthcare. Richard Cullen, Youngkin's counselor, determined their roles to be in compliance with state ethics rules. Youngkin identifies as "pro-life" but supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life.

- Youngkin's 2022 budget includes $1,000 bonuses for teachers, $1.25 billion for school construction, and an expansion of the Virginia Preschool Initiative to include younger children and higher-income families. To address teacher shortages, Youngkin issued an executive order to make it easier for certain individuals to become teachers. Youngkin supports expanding charter schools and has proposed $100 million for re-establishing lab schools, which he wants to open to partnerships with community colleges and private universities. He also advocates for revising school funding to allocate per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools instead of to the public school boards for the districts where the students reside. However, not all of his proposals have been adopted.

The budget included a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years, one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers, and $1.25 billion for school construction and maintenance. The Virginia Preschool Initiative was also expanded.
- After his campaign announcement, Youngkin proposed a series of tax cut measures, including eliminating the grocery tax, suspending gas tax increase, offering income tax rebates, doubling the standard deduction, cutting retirement tax for veterans, requiring voter approval for real estate property tax increases, and providing a tax holiday for small businesses. These proposals would have amounted to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts. However, much of the projected $2.6 billion budget surplus would be unavailable for tax cuts due to state law requiring over half to be allocated to reserve funds. Despite this, Virginia's budget surplus continued to grow, reaching at least $13.4 billion by the end of Northam's term. Youngkin hired Stephen Moore, who had previously overseen significant tax cuts in Kansas, as his campaign's senior economic advisor. However, the Kansas tax cuts were widely criticized for leading to spending cuts in education and transportation. In 2022, Youngkin signed a $165 billion state budget featuring $4 billion in tax cuts, with the centerpiece being a significant increase in the standard deduction for personal income tax. The budget also included one-time tax rebates, partial elimination of Virginia's grocery tax, and a military pension tax exemption. However, Youngkin's proposal for gas tax relief was blocked by the legislature, and a Democratic counter-proposal for direct payments to Virginia car owners was also opposed by Youngkin.
- Youngkin's tax cut proposals, worth $1.8 billion in one-time cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring cuts, were hindered by state law allocating a significant portion of the budget surplus to reserve funds. A compromise between parties led to the inclusion of a longtime Democratic priority in the budget, offering relief to low-income tax filers. Youngkin's plan for gas tax relief was blocked by the legislature, with concerns about lost revenue for transportation projects and insufficient consumer relief. His proposal for requiring public approval for real estate tax increases was not passed.

The budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included $4 billion in tax cuts, with a significant increase in the standard deduction, one-time tax rebates, partial elimination of the grocery tax, and a military pension tax exemption. However, it opposed Democratic counter-proposals for gas tax relief and direct payments to Virginia car owners. The budget also featured a $150 million investment in affordable housing, half the amount proposed by the previous administration.

Youngkin vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have allowed judges to mandate landlords address code violations, stating that tenants should share responsibility for maintaining safe living conditions. He has expressed intentions to modernize the Virginia Employment Commission and expand broadband access, while opposing minimum wage increases and supporting Virginia's right-to-work law.

Education was a central theme in Youngkin's campaign, with a focus on parental involvement and opposition to the supposed prevalence of critical race theory in the curriculum. However, fact-checkers found no evidence of critical race theory being part of state curriculum standards or widely taught in classrooms.
- Youngkin made changes to FOIA law regarding the release of files related to closed investigations and vetoed a bill related to civilian oversight boards.

During his campaign, Youngkin proposed eliminating Virginia's individual income tax, but later retracted it and announced more modest tax cut proposals, which would amount to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts.
- Youngkin's education platform was a major focus of his campaign, with an emphasis on parental involvement and opposition to supposed critical race theory teaching, even though fact-checkers found no evidence of it in state curriculum standards. He also opposed transgender student protections and planned to repeal related policies. His first official action as governor was to ban critical race theory in schools and related materials, and cancel the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to decrease suspension rates for Black students, promote cultural competency, and close the racial achievement gap. However, critics claimed the math initiative would have "dumbed down" standards and eliminated advanced high school math classes, though officials denied this. Youngkin also expressed intentions to address collective bargaining rights for public employees and project labor agreements.
- Youngkin advocates for private businesses to partner with lab schools and supports legislation that prioritizes applications from historically black colleges or universities and underserved communities. He proposed redirecting per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools, but the proposal was not adopted. In 2022, Youngkin signed laws allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, mandating digital floor plans for public schools, requiring the reporting of certain misdemeanor crimes committed by students on school grounds, and implementing measures to prevent hazing in colleges and universities. Regarding climate change, Youngkin is unclear about its cause but supports adaptation efforts and an "all of the above approach" to energy. He has withdrawn Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, citing cost savings for ratepayers, despite potential revenue loss for the state.
- Youngkin, upon becoming governor, banned critical race theory in schools and canceled the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to shift focus to data science and analytics while still offering calculus. Critics, including education officials, disputed claims that the initiative would "dumb down" standards or eliminate advanced math classes. Later, Youngkin signed a bill allowing parents to review and opt out of material with "sexually explicit content," and urged colleges to consider political diversity in hiring. He also enlisted a conservative think tank to assist in revising history and social sciences standards, and advocated for a bill to reverse admissions process reforms aimed at increasing diversity at two Governor's Schools. Additionally, he established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools.
- In February 2022, Youngkin's administration successfully revoked Virginia's COVID-19 workplace safety standards, initially adopted by Northam's administration, following the rejection of two board appointees by House Republicans. The standards, which included a mask mandate for high-risk indoor areas, officially ended in March. In January, the Virginia Department of Health, under Youngkin's authority, ceased contact tracing efforts due to the challenges posed by the Omicron variant. In May, Youngkin announced a new telework policy for executive branch employees, limiting telework to one day a week or with higher-level approvals, impacting state employees and potentially conflicting with private sector trends. Additionally, in 2022, Youngkin signed a bill restoring law enforcement discretion over releasing files related to closed investigations under the Freedom of Information Act, requiring victim notification and opportunity to object before releasing such files.
- Glenn Youngkin, Virginia's new governor, faced criticism from the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and educators for his stance on critical race theory, viewing its ban as an attempt to "whitewash" history and "erase black history." His first-day executive actions included rescinding COVID-19 regulations, such as mask mandates in schools and the vaccine mandate for state employees. He also ordered a reevaluation of workplace safety standards and fired the entire Virginia Parole Board. Youngkin's executive actions have been considered more polarizing than those of his predecessors, with two lawsuits brought against his executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia. A federal judge later ruled that school districts in Virginia could choose to require masking in areas frequented by certain plaintiffs.

 Youngkin did not define "political indoctrination" in the text. He did, however, establish a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools, which was criticized for being divisive, authoritarian, and unfairly targeting educators. This was part of a broader push to address critical race theory in the state's curriculum, but a signed bill had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law.

- After being elected, Youngkin established a tipline for reporting "divisive practices" in schools, which was criticized for being divisive, authoritarian, and unfairly targeting educators. It was part of a broader push to address critical race theory in the state's curriculum, but a signed bill had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law. The administration received criticism for not responding to inquiries about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used and denying FOIA requests. The tipline was closed down in September 2022 due to a lack of tips.

Youngkin attempted to amend a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board, aiming to hold the board accountable for their handling of sexual assault cases in the school system. However, the amendment was not successful. The amendment was criticized as an attempt to subvert the election results and an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.

In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools, established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. The new policies require student-access to school facilities and programs to be determined by biological sex, and mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender. The policies also mandate that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun. These actions are expected to face court challenges as several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet the criteria of protecting transgender students from bullying and harassment as stated in the 2020 bill.
- Youngkin has taken a firm stance against hypotheticals and demonstrated flexibility on controversial issues, such as supporting a candidate with a history of racist comments. His refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his party has received criticism. After Nancy Pelosi's husband was assaulted, Youngkin made a controversial comment that was criticized for its insensitivity. He later apologized for his rhetoric in a letter to Pelosi. Youngkin's actions have been noted to not always align with his espoused Christian values, contributing to a devolved state of political discourse. His approval rating among Virginians is not specified in the text.

However, it was argued that a bill signed by Youngkin had no legal impact as it reiterated existing federal law. The administration received criticism for not responding to inquiries about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used and denying FOIA requests. In November 2022, it was reported that the administration had closed down the tipline as tips had dried up. Additionally, Youngkin attempted to amend a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board, aiming to hold the board accountable for their handling of sexual assault cases in the school system.

He has withdrawn Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, citing cost savings for ratepayers, despite potential revenue loss for the state.
- Youngkin's administration has seen changes in roles for Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne, now serving as full-time senior political advisor and unpaid advisor to Stephen E. Cummings, respectively. Richard Cullen, Youngkin's counselor, has deemed their roles compliant with state ethics rules. Regarding abortion, Youngkin identifies as "pro-life" but supports legal access in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life. Post Dobbs v. Jackson, he called for a federal intervention on protests near conservative Supreme Court Justices' homes and expressed support for post-Dobbs abortion restrictions, advocating for a 15-week ban while indicating willingness to support further restrictions. On COVID-19, Youngkin supports the vaccination effort but opposes mandates, emphasizing personal choice while encouraging vaccination. He challenged the Biden administration's employer vaccine mandate.
- Youngkin's environmental and energy actions include withdrawing from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, proposing a nuclear reactor, and altering the permit-issuing process, which was criticized by environmental groups. He vetoed healthcare bills, contradicting national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation. In education, he reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges, facing criticism for pitting student groups against each other. Regarding LGBTQ+ rights, Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports it legally, and he hosted a private Pride event without inviting LGBTQ+ legislators, which was boycotted. He also declined to issue a Pride Month proclamation. In response to the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade, Youngkin refused to discuss hypotheticals regarding Obergefell v. Hodges. In marijuana policy, Youngkin proposed recriminalizing possessing more than two ounces of marijuana, which would make Virginia the only US state with misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount.

This proposal was influenced by a 2021 recommendation from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. In voting rights, Youngkin has continued restoring rights to former felons, but an automatic restoration amendment failed due to Republican opposition. Youngkin also campaigned for various candidates in the 2022 federal midterms, including those who embraced false claims about the 2020 election, which drew criticism from moderate Republicans. Regarding former Maine governor Paul LePage, who is known for racist comments, Youngkin initially claimed ignorance of the situation.
- Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, became Virginia's governor on January 15, 2022, along with his historically diverse ticket members, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, the first woman of color in a statewide office, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, the first Latino in a statewide office. His inauguration happened amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a winter storm. Youngkin's inaugural address emphasized religious confidence, boardroom bravado, and bipartisanship. However, he faced criticism for signing executive orders that banned teaching "inherently divisive concepts," like critical race theory, and lifted COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates. Critics argue that banning critical race theory is an attempt to "whitewash" history and "erase black history." While Youngkin's supporters, mainly conservative think tanks, view the order as "sensible and thoughtful," his critics, including the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and educators, strongly condemn it.

## question

How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact?

## ground_truth

Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.

## generated_answer

 Youngkin calls for better protection against pollution, supports cleaning the Chesapeake Bay, and establishes a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat sea-level rise, but opposes flood preparedness bills, attempts to rescind a ban on single-use plastics, and withdraws Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

- After his election, Youngkin took several actions related to the environment and energy. He withdrew Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, calling it a "carbon tax," and proposed building a small modular nuclear reactor in Southwest Virginia. He also reevaluated Virginia's membership in the initiative due to potential legal limitations. Youngkin called for better protection against pollution, support for cleaning the Chesapeake Bay, and establishing a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat sea-level rise. However, he opposed a bill aimed at improving flood preparedness and attempted to rescind a ban on single-use plastics, which environmental groups criticized. Youngkin also revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects, transferring authority from citizen review boards to the Department of Environmental Quality. In 2022, Youngkin vetoed bills related to health care, such as setting a statute of limitations on medical debt collection and prohibiting health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use, despite broad bipartisan support. His vetoes contradicted national studies and a bipartisan study commission's recommendation.

Regarding climate change, Youngkin is unclear about its cause but supports adaptation efforts and an "all of the above approach" to energy. He has withdrawn Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, citing cost savings for ratepayers, despite potential revenue loss for the state.
- Youngkin's tax cut proposals, worth $1.8 billion in one-time cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring cuts, were hindered by state law allocating a significant portion of the budget surplus to reserve funds. A compromise between parties led to the inclusion of a longtime Democratic priority in the budget, offering relief to low-income tax filers. Youngkin's plan for gas tax relief was blocked by the legislature, with concerns about lost revenue for transportation projects and insufficient consumer relief. His proposal for requiring public approval for real estate tax increases was not passed.

The budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included $4 billion in tax cuts, with a significant increase in the standard deduction, one-time tax rebates, partial elimination of the grocery tax, and a military pension tax exemption. However, it opposed Democratic counter-proposals for gas tax relief and direct payments to Virginia car owners. The budget also featured a $150 million investment in affordable housing, half the amount proposed by the previous administration.

Youngkin vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have allowed judges to mandate landlords address code violations, stating that tenants should share responsibility for maintaining safe living conditions. He has expressed intentions to modernize the Virginia Employment Commission and expand broadband access, while opposing minimum wage increases and supporting Virginia's right-to-work law.

Education was a central theme in Youngkin's campaign, with a focus on parental involvement and opposition to the supposed prevalence of critical race theory in the curriculum. However, fact-checkers found no evidence of critical race theory being part of state curriculum standards or widely taught in classrooms.
- Youngkin's administration has taken a firm stance against hypotheticals, as seen in his response regarding the potential reversal of the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage.

- Youngkin's education platform was a major focus of his campaign, with an emphasis on parental involvement and opposition to supposed critical race theory teaching, even though fact-checkers found no evidence of it in state curriculum standards. He also opposed transgender student protections and planned to repeal related policies. His first official action as governor was to ban critical race theory in schools and related materials, and cancel the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, which aimed to decrease suspension rates for Black students, promote cultural competency, and close the racial achievement gap. However, critics claimed the math initiative would have "dumbed down" standards and eliminated advanced high school math classes, though officials denied this. Youngkin also expressed intentions to address collective bargaining rights for public employees and project labor agreements.
- Youngkin's 2022 budget includes $1,000 bonuses for teachers, $1.25 billion for school construction, and an expansion of the Virginia Preschool Initiative to include younger children and higher-income families. To address teacher shortages, Youngkin issued an executive order to make it easier for certain individuals to become teachers. Youngkin supports expanding charter schools and has proposed $100 million for re-establishing lab schools, which he wants to open to partnerships with community colleges and private universities. He also advocates for revising school funding to allocate per pupil funding for lab school students to the institutions operating those schools instead of to the public school boards for the districts where the students reside. However, not all of his proposals have been adopted.
- Youngkin made changes to FOIA law regarding the release of files related to closed investigations and vetoed a bill related to civilian oversight boards. He also signed a Marcus alert system bill, a ban on law enforcement quotas, and limited an early release program for inmates. A bill proposed by the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which bans using the number of arrests or summonses as the sole criterion for evaluating law-enforcement officers, was supported by both parties and signed into law. Youngkin introduced a budget amendment making inmates convicted of violent crimes ineligible for an expanded early release program. During his campaign, Youngkin proposed eliminating Virginia's individual income tax, but later retracted it and announced more modest tax cut proposals, which would amount to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts.
- Youngkin's appointment of Andrew Wheeler as senior advisor and then director of the Office of Regulatory Management, after his nomination as Secretary of Natural Resources was rejected, did not require legislative approval. This appointment led to a dispute where Republicans, with Youngkin's support, initially planned to reject 1,000 of Northam's appointees, but later scaled it back to eleven. Democrats retaliated by rejecting some of Youngkin's nominees. Conflict escalated throughout the 2022 legislative session, resulting in Youngkin issuing more vetoes than his predecessors, mainly on bills sponsored by Democrats. The Youngkin administration also faced scrutiny for using Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne as unpaid advisors, presenting a possible conflict of interest. Moran, while serving as Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs, was on paid leave from two political consulting firms. Layne served as an unpaid advisor while working as an executive at Sentara Healthcare. Richard Cullen, Youngkin's counselor, determined their roles to be in compliance with state ethics rules. Youngkin identifies as "pro-life" but supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life.
- Youngkin supports a 15-week abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, or mother's life protection. He's open to further restrictions if votes allow. On COVID-19, he backs the vaccination campaign but opposes mandates, advocating personal choice. He challenged the Biden employer vaccine mandate, requesting rural hospital exemptions due to staffing issues. Youngkin also opposed adding COVID-19 vaccine to school children's required immunizations.

Regarding masks in schools, Youngkin initially favored a Florida-style ban on local mandates, then allowed local discretion, and ultimately signed an executive order repealing the statewide mandate while enabling local mandates. This order was challenged in court, resulting in a settlement upholding the ban, except in specific areas. Two executive actions were signed on the first day in office, rescinding the state employee vaccine mandate and reevaluating workplace safety standards. The Safety and Health Codes Board later voted to revoke pandemic mitigation safety standards.

- After the Hells Angels' involvement in drug trafficking and collaborations with the Patriarca crime family, several incidents occurred involving the motorcycle club. In 2002, Christopher J. Brennan, a Pagans member, was charged with attempted murder but served 90 days for reckless endangerment. In 2003, four Hells Angels were arrested in a nationwide investigation, with charges including drug and firearm possession. Violent incidents in the club's history include a 1969 battle with police and a 1975 kidnapping.

Following these incidents, several Hells Angels members were accused of various crimes. Leary was charged with assault and battery but acquitted. Two members were accused of raping a woman in 2004. Costin and Duda pleaded guilty to assaulting an off-duty police lieutenant in a bar. Ranieri fled from police during a traffic stop but was later arrested. Franco, a member with a criminal record, was found with a firearm and ammunition in 2011 and sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2013 for possessing a firearm after a felony conviction.

In 2013, two members of the Salem Hells Angels chapter and two members of the Red Devils, a Hells Angels support club, were arrested for kidnapping, mayhem, and extortion. The victim was assaulted with a ball-peen hammer, causing permanent injury, and forced to resign from the Red Devils. Barr, Eliason, Weymouth, and DeFronzo pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit violent crimes in 2015 and were sentenced to imprisonment.

The Hells Angels were also involved in a conflict with Lucifer's Henchmen MC in 1974, resulting in the fatal shooting of David A. Urban and the wounding of Mark W. Veherbon. The murder remains unsolved, but Lynn police believe it was due to a conflict over an incident at a local café.
- The Hells Angels have been involved in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, violence, and murder. In 1979, Hells Angels member Michele Gagnon is a prime suspect in two unsolved murders, and he was later found dead in an apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with his death being ruled a suicide, although some believe otherwise. In 1984, Hells Angels members Alan J. Cutler, Edward R. Simard, and John L. Burke were arrested for the murder of drug dealer Vincent DeNino. In 2011, Hells Angels members Adam Lee Hall, Caius Veiovis, and David Chalue were convicted of murdering three individuals and disposing of their bodies. In 1980, Hells Angels members Alan Hogan, Robert Montgomery, and Thomas Apostolos were imprisoned for operating a methamphetamine lab. In 1985, five Hells Angels members were arrested for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and 13 members and former members were indicted for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine between 1987 and 1991.
- After a change in leadership from "Diamond" Dan Bifield to Mark "Lightning" Baker in the Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter, law enforcement arrested twenty members and associates following a drug deal involving Bifield in 2011. The group was sentenced to over 100 years in prison collectively. In Virginia, four members and one prospect from the New York metropolitan area Hells Angels chapter were convicted of ambushing and wounding two Pagans members in 2018, resulting in four-year sentences for some and eight years for others. In Washington state, the Hells Angels established a Nomads chapter in 1994. In 2001, former Hells Angel Rodney Lee Rollness, along with Joshua Binder and others, were convicted of racketeering offenses and murdering a man who falsely claimed to be a Hells Angel member.
- After the Hells Angels were involved in various criminal activities and conflicts with rival clubs, several violent incidents occurred. These include the 1974 conflict with Lucifer's Henchmen MC, resulting in the fatal shooting of David A. Urban and the wounding of Mark W. Veherbon. The murder remains unsolved, but police suspect it was due to a café incident. In 1975, James Rich was stabbed by suspected Hells Angels members, and his friends retaliated by killing a non-gang member. In 1991, two Hells Angels members were stabbed, allegedly by Devil's Disciples members. In 2016, two Hells Angels members were arrested for assaulting Defiant Disciples MC members. In 2022, a brawl involving the Hells Angels and Pagans resulted in seven stab wounds. Additionally, Hells Angels member Michele Gagnon is a prime suspect in two unsolved murders from 1979, involving his girlfriend and roommate. Three Hells Angels members were arrested for the 1984 murder of drug dealer Vincent DeNino.
- After the undercover operation "Black Biscuit," which infiltrated the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC) in Arizona for 21 months and resulted in several arrests and seizures, an investigation led to the conviction of three HAMC members for murdering Cynthia Garcia in 2001. However, the conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded due to the investigation. Garcia, a mother of six, was murdered by Kevin J. Augustiniak, Michael Christopher "Mesa Mike" Kramer, and Paul Merle Eischeid due to her disrespectful behavior towards the club. They beat her unconscious, stabbed her 27 times, and attempted to decapitate her. Kramer became an informant for the ATF and signed a plea agreement to serve five years of probation for the murder. Eischeid fled the country and was placed on the USMS 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was apprehended in Argentina in 2011 and extradited to Arizona in July 2018. Augustiniak pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2011 and was sentenced to 23 years and six months' imprisonment. The murder of Cynthia Garcia remains unsolved.
- In 2002, Christopher J. Brennan, a member of the Pagans, pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and served 90 days in jail. Originally, he was also charged with attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, but these charges were dropped due to lack of witness cooperation. In 2003, four members of the North Beach Hells Angels chapter were arrested on federal drug and firearm charges. During a raid, agents found 17 firearms, over 270 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, and methamphetamine. Two undercover ATF agents had witnessed one of the arrested members selling cocaine at the clubhouse. These arrests were part of a nationwide investigation into the Hells Angels, including chapters in Massachusetts. The Hells Angels have been involved in drug trafficking and have collaborated with the Patriarca crime family in loansharking and narcotics distribution. They have a history of violent incidents, such as a 1969 battle with police in Lowell and a 1975 kidnapping and assault case.
- Following the violent incidents in 1975 involving the Bridgeport Hells Angels, where two members were killed and another was critically wounded, the club's members have continued to be involved in criminal activities and gang-related violence. In 1977, a Hells Angels member was investigated for the homicide of a black inmate at Northern Correctional Institution. In 1979, the chapter president, Daniel Eugene "Diamond Dan" Bifield, was arrested for possession of a shotgun by a convicted felon. In 1980, a Hells Angels member was sentenced to prison for murdering a bar patron, and in 1998, another member was sentenced for killing a rejected club prospect and state police informant. In 2006, a senior member was shot and killed while riding his motorcycle, and two other Hells Angels members were arrested for weapons possession and theft. In 2010, the Hells Angels were considered suspects in the murder of the president of the Outlaws' Waterbury chapter. In 2016, a Hells Angels associate was arrested for stabbing and beating a delinquent debtor in connection with an extortion scheme. Members of the Hells Angels' Bridgeport chapter were later found to be involved in the assault.
- The Hells Angels have been involved in various criminal activities, including loansharking, racketeering, and violence. In 1987, Mark "Rebel" McKenna, a member of the Hells Angels, was indicted for operating a large loansharking ring in Boston. In 2007, a joint investigation by several law enforcement agencies resulted in the arrests of six club members on various charges. Some members were sentenced to prison for weapons and tax-related offenses. The Hells Angels have also been involved in methamphetamine distribution in Nebraska and have been connected to violent incidents and murders in Omaha. These criminal activities have resulted in severe consequences for its members and have required significant law enforcement efforts to combat. (236 words -> 119 words)

However, the conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded due to the investigation. Garcia, a mother of six, was murdered by Kevin J. Augustiniak, Michael Christopher "Mesa Mike" Kramer, and Paul Merle Eischeid due to her disrespectful behavior towards the club. They beat her unconscious, stabbed her 27 times, and attempted to decapitate her. Kramer became an informant for the ATF and signed a plea agreement to serve five years of probation for the murder. Eischeid fled the country and was placed on the USMS 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was apprehended in Argentina in 2011 and extradited to Arizona in July 2018. Augustiniak pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2011 and was sentenced to 23 years and six months' imprisonment. The murder of Cynthia Garcia remains unsolved.
- After a change in leadership from "Diamond" Dan Bifield to Mark "Lightning" Baker in the Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter, law enforcement arrested twenty members and associates following a drug deal involving Bifield in 2011. The group was sentenced to over 100 years in prison collectively. In Virginia, four members and one prospect from the New York metropolitan area Hells Angels chapter were convicted of ambushing and wounding two Pagans members in 2018, resulting in four-year sentences for some and eight years for others. In Washington state, the Hells Angels established a Nomads chapter in 1994. In 2001, former Hells Angel Rodney Lee Rollness, along with Joshua Binder and others, were convicted of racketeering offenses and murdering a man who falsely claimed to be a Hells Angel member.
- In 2002, Christopher J. Brennan, a member of the Pagans, pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and served 90 days in jail. Originally, he was also charged with attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, but these charges were dropped due to lack of witness cooperation. In 2003, four members of the North Beach Hells Angels chapter were arrested on federal drug and firearm charges. During a raid, agents found 17 firearms, over 270 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, and methamphetamine. Two undercover ATF agents had witnessed one of the arrested members selling cocaine at the clubhouse. These arrests were part of a nationwide investigation into the Hells Angels, including chapters in Massachusetts. The Hells Angels have been involved in drug trafficking and have collaborated with the Patriarca crime family in loansharking and narcotics distribution. They have a history of violent incidents, such as a 1969 battle with police in Lowell and a 1975 kidnapping and assault case.
- After Finazzo's death, Fred Martin Scarnechia, the new chapter president, and another Hells Angel, Thomas Lee Campbell, assaulted a federal agent during a drug deal sting operation in 1982. The authorities discovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons, including explosives and automatic weapons, in a nearby storage unit. Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for the assault. The Charlotte chapter, once the largest on the east coast, was disbanded after facing numerous problems, including murders and imprisonments of members, and the clubhouse was burned down in 1985.

The Hells Angels have avoided Oregon since 1967 due to an agreement with the Gypsy Jokers. In 1994, a Hells Angels prospect, Robert "Bugeye Bob" McClure, was sentenced to four consecutive life terms for a quadruple murder in Gaston.
- The Hells Angels have been involved in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, violence, and murder. In 1979, Hells Angels member Michele Gagnon is a prime suspect in two unsolved murders, and he was later found dead in an apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with his death being ruled a suicide, although some believe otherwise. In 1984, Hells Angels members Alan J. Cutler, Edward R. Simard, and John L. Burke were arrested for the murder of drug dealer Vincent DeNino. In 2011, Hells Angels members Adam Lee Hall, Caius Veiovis, and David Chalue were convicted of murdering three individuals and disposing of their bodies. In 1980, Hells Angels members Alan Hogan, Robert Montgomery, and Thomas Apostolos were imprisoned for operating a methamphetamine lab. In 1985, five Hells Angels members were arrested for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and 13 members and former members were indicted for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine between 1987 and 1991.
- After the violent incidents in 1975, members of the Bridgeport Hells Angels have continued to be involved in criminal activities and gang-related violence. In 2016, a Hells Angels associate, Howard Hammer, was contracted by a loanshark to collect a debt from a delinquent debtor. When the debtor couldn't pay and falsely claimed to be a Hells Angels chapter president, he was attacked by members of the Bridgeport chapter. Hammer refused to identify those involved, but was later convicted of conspiracy to participate in extortion. In the same year, 37 members and associates of the Bridgeport Hells Angels were arrested on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in a three-year FBI investigation known as Operation Roughrider. The investigation resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs and weapons, and the arrests of over a hundred Hells Angels members and associates. In addition, there were threats made against law enforcement officers involved in the investigation, resulting in increased security measures for some individuals.

Thirty-five of those charged were convicted, including Roger "Bear" Mariani, Robert "Red Dog" Redmann, and Joseph Whelan, who were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. In 1986, detective Nicholas Barone of the Connecticut State Police received intelligence indicating that he and H. James Pickerstein, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, were to be physically harmed by the HAMC in retaliation for their efforts in the investigation and subsequent prosecutions. In 2005, four leading members of the Hells Angels in northern Illinois were arrested and charged with numerous crimes including violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. At least three were convicted and sentenced to prison. In 2016, law enforcement in Indiana received public backlash for heavily patrolling a charity event held by the HAMC.

The HAMC has faced challenges in establishing a presence in the Philadelphia area due to an alliance between the Pagans and the Philadelphia crime family. In 2005, the Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter was disbanded following a war with the Pagans, which resulted in the murder of the Hells Angels vice-president, Thomas "Thinker" Wood. The Hells Angels' Rhode Island chapter, formed in 1992, has a working relationship with the Providence faction of the Patriarca crime family. A member of the New Rochelle, New York chapter of the Hells Angels was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in 2012 for a federal firearms charge.

- The Hells Angels motorcycle gang has been involved in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking and violence. They obtained methamphetamine from other chapters and distributed it in Omaha, using motorcycles and cars to transport the drugs. This conspiracy resulted in the unsolved murder of Joseph Sackett and the arrests of ten members and associates in 1981. In 1985, an undercover FBI agent infiltrated the club for twenty-six months, leading to the indictments of 133 members and associates in eleven states on narcotics trafficking and racketeering charges. In 1990, fifteen members and associates were arrested on charges including racketeering, money laundering, and drug trafficking. The club's criminal activities have resulted in severe consequences for its members and have required significant law enforcement efforts to combat.

In 2002, members of the Hells Angels and the Mongols motorcycle clubs fought each other at the Harrah's Casino & Hotel in Laughlin, Nevada, resulting in the deaths of two Hells Angels and one Mongol.

- Under Fred Silverman's leadership at NBC, the network faced difficulties in producing hits and maintaining affiliate stations, with many of the shows he greenlit failing to gain popularity. This led to several NBC affiliates defecting to other networks, particularly in smaller markets like Yuma, Arizona, where it took many years to get another local NBC affiliate. The network's cancellation of the 1980 Summer Olympics coverage further exacerbated its problems. Silverman's leadership was heavily criticized, both externally and internally, leading to his resignation in 1981.

Grant Tinker and Brandon Tartikoff took over and inherited a schedule with aging dramas and few sitcoms. Tartikoff demonstrated patience with promising programs, such as Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, and Cheers, which had poor ratings but desirable demographics. The A-Team became the network's biggest hit during this period.

In 1982, NBC gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to David Letterman, who launched Late Night with David Letterman, which proved successful and served as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise. The Cosby Show's success in 1984 led to renewed interest in sitcoms, and Family Ties and Cheers saw increased viewership due to Cosby as a lead-in.
- Under Tinker and Tartikoff's leadership, NBC introduced successful shows like The A-Team, Late Night with David Letterman, and The Cosby Show, which helped the network recover from a disastrous 1983-84 season. The Cosby Show's success led to renewed interest in sitcoms, boosting shows like Family Ties and Cheers. NBC rose to first place in ratings by 1985-86, launching popular shows such as The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, and ALF. The network also started broadcasting in stereo in 1985 and repaired old affiliations with local stations. In 1987, NBC introduced a syndication package, "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", consisting of five sitcoms aimed at attracting viewers before prime time. However, these shows often underperformed compared to popular syndicated game shows. By the end of the 1987-88 season, Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made, and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication.
- In the late 1960s, NBC acquired the rights to broadcast "The Wizard of Oz" after CBS declined to pay the increased fee for renewal. This acquisition was part of NBC's strategy to modernize its programming and attract younger viewers, as the network aimed to target adults aged 18-49. Despite airing the film without a hosted introduction and making slight edits for commercials, it received high ratings. However, NBC's success was short-lived as the network entered a slump in the 1970s. Under new president Herbert Schlosser, NBC attempted to attract younger viewers with costly movies, miniseries, and specials, but this strategy failed. The network's lone breakout success was the late-night comedy/variety show, NBC's Saturday Night, later renamed Saturday Night Live. When Schlosser was promoted, NBC lured Fred Silverman from ABC to revive its fortunes, but his tenure resulted in more failures than hits.
- In the mid to late 1980s, under Tinker and Tartikoff's leadership, NBC experienced a resurgence with successful shows like The A-Team, The Cosby Show, and Miami Vice. The network also began broadcasting in stereo and repaired old affiliations with local stations. In 1987, NBC introduced a syndication package, "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", but the sitcoms in this package often underperformed compared to popular syndicated game shows. Many of the shows, such as Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made, and You Can't Take It With You, were cancelled by the end of the 1987-88 season. However, Out of This World was an exception and ran for three additional seasons. NBC also made plans to increase output of in-house productions and integrate NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications. The network aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. NBC's success continued into the early 1990s with new hits such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Blossom, and Law & Order. Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment in 1991, and was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president were shaky due to most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. However, Littlefield's tenure improved with the launches of new hit series such as Mad About You, Wings, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER and Will & Grace. Shows like Seinfeld and Frasier became critical and commercial successes, with Seinfeld ending its run in 1998 as the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings. Friends emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast, dominating the ratings and becoming the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings.
- Under Fred Silverman's leadership at NBC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the network struggled to produce hits, with a few exceptions such as CHiPs, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life, Real People, and Shōgun. Many of the shows he greenlit were unsuccessful, including Hello, Larry, Supertrain, Pink Lady and Jeff, The Krofft Superstar Hour, season six of Saturday Night Live, and The Waverly Wonders. These failures led to several longtime NBC affiliates defecting to ABC and CBS, particularly in markets with VHF stations. Some markets, like Yuma, Arizona, had to wait many years to get another local NBC affiliate. While some stations have since rejoined the network, others have switched to full-time Fox or CBS affiliates. This period was marked by NBC's struggle to attract viewers and maintain its affiliate stations.
- In the late 1990s and early 2000s, NBC experienced further success with shows like Friends, Frasier, and ER. Friends, in particular, became a massive hit, topping the Nielsen ratings for several seasons, while Frasier gained critical acclaim and numerous Emmy Awards. NBC's "Must See TV" branding for its Thursday night lineup, which started in 1994, helped solidify its status as a leading network. During this time, NBC also acquired rights to three of the four major professional sports leagues, the Olympics, and Notre Dame football. However, the network faced a significant setback in 1998 when it lost NFL rights to CBS, ending its 59-year relationship with the league.

As the new century began, NBC's long-standing ratings lead ended, with CBS overtaking it for first place in 2000. Despite the success of Friends, Will & Grace, ER, and Just Shoot Me!, NBC struggled to maintain its dominance on Thursday nights. In an attempt to attract new viewers, NBC started airing select dramas in letterbox over its analog broadcast feed in 2001, but only saw a minor boost in ratings.
- In the 2009-10 season, NBC's performance continued to decline despite some shows being renewed for second seasons. The network faced controversy over its broadcast of the Winter Olympics and the cancellation of popular shows. NBC attempted to shift The Jay Leno Show to prime time, but it was criticized and ultimately unsuccessful. The network's ratings did not improve, and it remained in fourth place. In 2010, Comcast announced it would purchase a majority stake in NBC Universal, and Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal. The network found a breakout hit in The Voice, but still struggled with ratings and cancelled most of its new fall programs. NBC converted to an all-HD schedule and managed to lift itself into third place in the 18-49 demographic in the 2011-12 season. However, it remained a distant fourth place in total viewership and only four shows survived for a second season. In the fall of 2012, NBC expanded its sitcom roster.
- In the early 2000s, NBC's long-standing ratings lead ended, with CBS overtaking it for first place. CBS's success was partly due to moving its hit reality series Survivor to Thursday nights. Despite this, NBC continued to lead the Thursday ratings with shows like Friends, Will & Grace, ER, and Just Shoot Me!. NBC started airing select dramas in letterbox in 2001, but only saw a minor boost in ratings. The network also lost broadcast rights to Major League Baseball and the NBA. In 2003, NBC acquired Spanish-language network Telemundo and merged with Vivendi Universal Entertainment, forming NBC Universal. However, NBC faced several challenges, including the end of Friends and Frasier, the death of Jerry Orbach, and the decline in ratings for Joey and Will & Grace. The network's ratings fell to fourth place in the 2005-06 season, with only one fall series, My Name Is Earl, surviving for a second season. Despite these challenges, NBC had some successes, such as the hit series Heroes and critically acclaimed sitcoms The Office and 30 Rock. However, all networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by cable television, home video, video games, and the Internet, with NBC being the hardest hit.

- NBC's comedy offerings experienced success in the 2015-16 season with the debut of "Superstore" and the continued success of "The Blacklist" and the Chicago franchise. The network also found a hit in the comedy-drama "This Is Us" in the 2016-17 season. During the 2017-18 season, NBC saw further success with "Ellen's Game of Games" and the return of "Will & Grace." The network also premiered several shows in the 2018-19 season, including "The Titan Games," "Manifest," "Songland," and "New Amsterdam," all of which were renewed for additional seasons. However, the network's dominance in the 2010s faded during the 2019-20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a disruption in production and leading to a move to the second position in the Nielsen ratings. NBC reclaimed its status as the top-rated network in 2022.
- In the 2011-12 season, NBC's broadcast of the Super Bowl and the success of The Voice, Smash, and Sunday Night Football helped the network break its eight-year streak in fourth place in the 18-49 demographic. However, the network's midseason ratings suffered in 2013, falling to fifth place during the February sweeps period. Despite this, NBC became the No. 1 network in the 18-49 demographic in the 2013-14 season for the first time since 2003-04, due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football, and new hits like The Blacklist and Hannibal. The network also saw improvement in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season. The 2015-16 season was successful for NBC with the launch of new dramas Blindspot and Chicago Med, and the continued success of The Blacklist and the Chicago franchise. The network also found success in the new comedy Superstore. The 2016-17 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of comedy-drama This Is Us and the continued growth of the Chicago franchise.

- In the 1930s, NBC outgrew its facilities on Fifth Avenue and developed a shortwave radio network called the NBC White Network. General Electric, an early shareholder in NBC's parent company RCA, divested itself from RCA, leading to RCA becoming the lead tenant at the Rockefeller Center's RCA Building. The iconic NBC chimes were adopted in 1931, initially intended as a system cue for switching stations, and later used by the NBC television network and even licensed to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations. It was sold to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).

- In the early 1920s, radio broadcasting began consolidating, with radio manufacturer RCA acquiring New York's WEAF from AT&T and transferring Westinghouse's WJZ to RCA. WEAF served as a lab for AT&T's Western Electric, which developed audio transmission technologies. WEAF was successful with a regular schedule of programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs. In 1923, RCA attempted to transmit audio between cities via telegraph lines, but it failed due to interference. AT&T sold WEAF and its embryonic network to RCA in 1925, allowing RCA to use AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. RCA, GE, and Westinghouse then created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1926, which was split into the Red and Blue Networks in 1927, focusing on commercially sponsored entertainment and non-sponsored broadcasts, respectively. NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks in 1927 and 1931, carrying Red and Blue Network programming. NBC moved to 711 Fifth Avenue in 1927 and then to the Rockefeller Center in 1933, where it became the lead tenant in the RCA Building.

In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations. It was sold to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).
- After selling NBC's radio holdings to Westwood One in 1987, GE proceeded to sell off individual radio stations to various companies, including Emmis Communications, Westinghouse, and Susquehanna Radio Corporation, by 1989. NBC Radio News moved to Mutual's Arlington, Virginia, facility, with engineering operations and the affiliate relations department following suit. Further consolidation in 1992 led to joint production of newscasts during overnights and weekends, and both networks airing generic sportscasts. In 1994, Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting, which then acquired 25% of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity was subsequently acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1996, leading to CBS Radio Network falling under Westwood One management. The Mutual/NBC newsroom in Arlington closed in 1998, with CBS Radio News originating "NBC"-branded newscasts from New York. Westwood One launched NBC News Radio in 2003, which became a full-time operation in 2012 after acquiring Dial Global. NBC Sports Radio was launched in 2014 as a Dial Global/NBC Sports joint venture but ended 24/7 programming in 2018 and was shut down in 2020. Cumulus Media acquired Dial Global in 2013, reverting to the Westwood One name and merging it into Cumulus Media Networks. NBC News Radio ended operations in December 2014 after Cumulus announced a content-sharing deal with CNN as part of the pending launch of Westwood One News. Since 2016, iHeartMedia has produced "NBC News Radio"-branded newscasts via a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal. Television.

In the context of NBC's history, the network was once closely associated with David Sarnoff, who used it as a platform to sell consumer electronics. NBC and RCA introduced all-electronic television to the public at the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt appearing on television for the first time. NBC began transmitting network programs in 1
- After being formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red becoming NBC Red Network, Inc., both networks separated their operations in 1942. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). NBC, on the other hand, became home to many popular performers and programs during the golden age of radio. However, in the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies, leading to many NBC performers, including Jack Benny, jumping to CBS. NBC stars also began migrating to television, causing a decline in NBC's radio programming. In response, NBC launched The Big Show in 1950, but it only lasted two years due to declining radio audiences. NBC's last major radio programming push was Monitor, which began on June 12, 1955.
- After the U.S. entered World War II, commercial programming on NBC was limited and telecasts were reduced. However, NBC started regularly transmitting a few programs to affiliated stations in Philadelphia and Schenectady from 1944, with "The Voice of Firestone Televues" being the first regularly scheduled show. "The War As It Happens," initially a local program, was also transmitted to multiple cities on the NBC Television Network in April 1944. On V-E Day in 1945, WNBT broadcast extensive news coverage and remotes from New York City, promoting the event in advance.

Post-war, NBC's television network expanded from four stations, with the 1947 World Series boosting local television sales. By the early 1950s, NBC had achieved success in television, launching shows like Today, The Tonight Show, and Wide Wide World. NBC commissioned Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera for television, "Amahl and the Night Visitors," which was a major hit.

Although CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the U.S., their system was incompatible with black and white sets, leading to its abandonment. NBC, ready with color programming, began the transition to the RCA-compatible color system within days of its approval by the FCC in December 1953. NBC's first program to air all episodes in color, "The Marriage," began in the summer of 1954, and a live color production of "Peter Pan" was broadcast in 1955.
- After the failure of The Big Show, NBC made one last significant effort in radio programming with Monitor, which began in 1955. Monitor was a continuous all-weekend mix of music, news, interviews, and features, featuring well-known entertainers and television personalities. Despite initial success, local stations became reluctant to break from their established formats for non-conforming network programming, leading to Monitor's decline and eventual end in 1975. NBC then launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), providing all-news radio to local stations, but it was discontinued due to profitability concerns. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a secondary network providing news and features to FM rock stations. NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call-in national talk radio with TalkNet, which, despite not being a ratings success, helped further the national talk radio format. Ultimately, GE reacquired RCA, announced its intent to sell NBC's radio holdings, and sold the NBC Radio Network, The Source, NBC Talknet, and NBC Radio Entertainment to Westwood One in 1987.
- Under Fred Silverman's leadership at NBC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the network struggled to produce hits, with a few exceptions such as CHiPs, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life, Real People, and Shōgun. Many of the shows he greenlit were unsuccessful, including Hello, Larry, Supertrain, Pink Lady and Jeff, The Krofft Superstar Hour, season six of Saturday Night Live, and The Waverly Wonders. These failures led to several longtime NBC affiliates defecting to ABC and CBS, particularly in markets with VHF stations. Some markets, like Yuma, Arizona, had to wait many years to get another local NBC affiliate. While some stations have since rejoined the network, others have switched to full-time Fox or CBS affiliates. This period was marked by NBC's struggle to attract viewers and maintain its affiliate stations.
- In the late 1930s and early 1940s, NBC made significant strides in television broadcasting. Despite DuMont Laboratories offering home sets in 1938, NBC's official television launch in April 1939 saw slow sales due to high costs and lack of regular programming. However, NBC made history by broadcasting professional football and baseball games, and covering special events like President Roosevelt's speech at Madison Square Garden in 1940. The first commercial television broadcasts began in July 1941, with WNBT airing the first paid advertisement for Bulova watches. Prior to this, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis, with NBC's earliest examples seen during the first televised baseball game in 1939. Limited commercial programming resumed after the war, with regular weekly transmissions from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady starting in 1944.

- After CBS abandoned its incompatible color broadcast system in the early 1950s, NBC quickly adopted the RCA-compatible color system and began broadcasting color programs. NBC started with a few shows in 1954, including "The Marriage," and aired the first live color production of "Peter Pan" in 1955. NBC's success with color programming led to the establishment of a subsidiary, California National Productions, for merchandising and syndication operations. By 1963, most of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, and the network began branding itself as "The Full Color Network." NBC's commitment to color broadcasting led to the acquisition of the broadcast rights to the classic film "The Wizard of Oz" in 1967, which had previously been a staple of CBS's color broadcasts.

However, Out of This World was an exception and ran for three additional seasons. NBC also made plans to increase output of in-house productions and integrate NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications. The network aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. NBC's success continued into the early 1990s with new hits such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Blossom, and Law & Order. Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment in 1991, and was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president were shaky due to most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. However, Littlefield's tenure improved with the launches of new hit series such as Mad About You, Wings, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER and Will & Grace. Shows like Seinfeld and Frasier became critical and commercial successes, with Seinfeld ending its run in 1998 as the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings. Friends emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast, dominating the ratings and becoming the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings.

- In the 1930s, NBC outgrew its facilities on Fifth Avenue and developed a shortwave radio network called the NBC White Network. General Electric, an early shareholder in NBC's parent company RCA, divested itself from RCA, leading to RCA becoming the lead tenant at the Rockefeller Center's RCA Building. The iconic NBC chimes were adopted in 1931, initially intended as a system cue for switching stations, and later used by the NBC television network and even licensed to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations. It was sold to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).
- After being formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red becoming NBC Red Network, Inc., both networks separated their operations in 1942. In 1943, RCA was forced to sell NBC Blue due to antitrust violations to the American Broadcasting System, owned by Edward J. Noble, and was later renamed as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). NBC, on the other hand, became home to many popular performers and programs during the golden age of radio. However, in the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies, leading to many NBC performers, including Jack Benny, jumping to CBS. NBC stars also began migrating to television, causing a decline in NBC's radio programming. In response, NBC launched The Big Show in 1950, but it only lasted two years due to declining radio audiences. NBC's last major radio programming push was Monitor, which began on June 12, 1955.
- In the early 1920s, radio broadcasting began consolidating, with radio manufacturer RCA acquiring New York's WEAF from AT&T and transferring Westinghouse's WJZ to RCA. WEAF served as a lab for AT&T's Western Electric, which developed audio transmission technologies. WEAF was successful with a regular schedule of programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs. In 1923, RCA attempted to transmit audio between cities via telegraph lines, but it failed due to interference. AT&T sold WEAF and its embryonic network to RCA in 1925, allowing RCA to use AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. RCA, GE, and Westinghouse then created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1926, which was split into the Red and Blue Networks in 1927, focusing on commercially sponsored entertainment and non-sponsored broadcasts, respectively. NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks in 1927 and 1931, carrying Red and Blue Network programming. NBC moved to 711 Fifth Avenue in 1927 and then to the Rockefeller Center in 1933, where it became the lead tenant in the RCA Building.
- After the U.S. entered World War II, commercial programming on NBC was limited and telecasts were reduced. However, NBC started regularly transmitting a few programs to affiliated stations in Philadelphia and Schenectady from 1944, with "The Voice of Firestone Televues" being the first regularly scheduled show. "The War As It Happens," initially a local program, was also transmitted to multiple cities on the NBC Television Network in April 1944. On V-E Day in 1945, WNBT broadcast extensive news coverage and remotes from New York City, promoting the event in advance.

Post-war, NBC's television network expanded from four stations, with the 1947 World Series boosting local television sales. By the early 1950s, NBC had achieved success in television, launching shows like Today, The Tonight Show, and Wide Wide World. NBC commissioned Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera for television, "Amahl and the Night Visitors," which was a major hit.

Although CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the U.S., their system was incompatible with black and white sets, leading to its abandonment. NBC, ready with color programming, began the transition to the RCA-compatible color system within days of its approval by the FCC in December 1953. NBC's first program to air all episodes in color, "The Marriage," began in the summer of 1954, and a live color production of "Peter Pan" was broadcast in 1955.
- Under Tinker and Tartikoff's leadership, NBC introduced successful shows like The A-Team, Late Night with David Letterman, and The Cosby Show, which helped the network recover from a disastrous 1983-84 season. The Cosby Show's success led to renewed interest in sitcoms, boosting shows like Family Ties and Cheers. NBC rose to first place in ratings by 1985-86, launching popular shows such as The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, and ALF. The network also started broadcasting in stereo in 1985 and repaired old affiliations with local stations. In 1987, NBC introduced a syndication package, "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", consisting of five sitcoms aimed at attracting viewers before prime time. However, these shows often underperformed compared to popular syndicated game shows. By the end of the 1987-88 season, Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made, and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication.
- In the mid to late 1980s, under Tinker and Tartikoff's leadership, NBC experienced a resurgence with successful shows like The A-Team, The Cosby Show, and Miami Vice. The network also began broadcasting in stereo and repaired old affiliations with local stations. In 1987, NBC introduced a syndication package, "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", but the sitcoms in this package often underperformed compared to popular syndicated game shows. Many of the shows, such as Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made, and You Can't Take It With You, were cancelled by the end of the 1987-88 season. However, Out of This World was an exception and ran for three additional seasons. NBC also made plans to increase output of in-house productions and integrate NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications. The network aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. NBC's success continued into the early 1990s with new hits such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Blossom, and Law & Order. Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment in 1991, and was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president were shaky due to most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs.

Friends emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast, dominating the ratings and becoming the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings.
- After selling NBC's radio holdings to Westwood One in 1987, GE proceeded to sell off individual radio stations to various companies, including Emmis Communications, Westinghouse, and Susquehanna Radio Corporation, by 1989. NBC Radio News moved to Mutual's Arlington, Virginia, facility, with engineering operations and the affiliate relations department following suit. Further consolidation in 1992 led to joint production of newscasts during overnights and weekends, and both networks airing generic sportscasts. In 1994, Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting, which then acquired 25% of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity was subsequently acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1996, leading to CBS Radio Network falling under Westwood One management. The Mutual/NBC newsroom in Arlington closed in 1998, with CBS Radio News originating "NBC"-branded newscasts from New York. Westwood One launched NBC News Radio in 2003, which became a full-time operation in 2012 after acquiring Dial Global. NBC Sports Radio was launched in 2014 as a Dial Global/NBC Sports joint venture but ended 24/7 programming in 2018 and was shut down in 2020. Cumulus Media acquired Dial Global in 2013, reverting to the Westwood One name and merging it into Cumulus Media Networks. NBC News Radio ended operations in December 2014 after Cumulus announced a content-sharing deal with CNN as part of the pending launch of Westwood One News. Since 2016, iHeartMedia has produced "NBC News Radio"-branded newscasts via a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal. Television.

In the context of NBC's history, the network was once closely associated with David Sarnoff, who used it as a platform to sell consumer electronics. NBC and RCA introduced all-electronic television to the public at the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt appearing on television for the first time. NBC began transmitting network programs in 1

- The representation of light in painting varies depending on the genre and technique used. In interior paintings, light creates intimate environments with contrasts of light and shadow, while in still life, artists can manipulate light at will for dramatic effects. Exterior paintings, such as landscapes, seascapes, and skyscapes, are enveloped in a luminous atmosphere that changes based on the time of day, weather, and environmental conditions. Artists often paint en plein air to capture their impressions directly. The human figure in painting is affected by light, which influences volume, generates different limits, and alters skin color. In abstract painting, light is used in a subjective way to convey concepts or sensations of the artist.
- During the Renaissance, there was a shift towards naturalistic representation of reality, including the study of light. This was evident in the use of linear perspective, chiaroscuro, and gradation to indicate depth, volume, and lighting effects. The oil painting technique became popular, providing greater chromatic richness and facilitating the representation of light. Renaissance light, often intense in the foreground and diminishing towards the background, was used as a tool to measure and order reality, shaping a plastic space through naturalistic representation. The first theoretical treatises on the representation of light in painting also emerged during this period. These artists and theorists emphasized the interdependence of light and color, and the use of light and shadow to create relief in painting.
- The representation of light in painting, including the human body and inanimate objects, is crucial for creating visual images on canvas. In abstract painting, light is used subjectively to convey concepts or sensations. The chronological factor is also significant in painting, with light playing a role in depicting specific times of day, which became more precise with advancements in artificial lighting. The first light of the day, dawn, was initially used sparingly but gained popularity in the 17th century, often creating a spherical effect.
- The text discusses various ways to harmonize colors in painting, including using warm and cool thermal ranges, complementary colors, and broken ranges. Warm colors include red, orange, purple, yellowish green, and black, while cool colors consist of blue, green, violet, and white. Complementary colors create the greatest chromatic contrast, and broken ranges involve neutralizing primary colors with their complementary colors to produce intense luminous effects.

The text also explains how the quality and appearance of light representation in a painting depend on the technique used. Different techniques and materials produce different light effects. For example, in drawing, light effects are achieved through black-white duality, while in oil painting, colors are dissolved in an oily binder, producing vivid colors and intense brightness. Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil and a binder, while watercolor uses transparent pigments diluted in water. Acrylic paint uses a plastic binder, which produces fast drying and flat colors.

Finally, the text mentions that light has different considerations depending on the pictorial genre. In interiors, light tends to create intimate environments with contrasts of light and shadow, while in exteriors, light has different incidences on objects and people. In still life paintings, artists can manipulate light at will, often with dramatic effects.
- The light source can be internal or external to the painting and can have a direct or indirect origin. Light defines the space and volume of objects through contrast with shadow, creating a gradient that gives a sense of depth. Contrast is crucial in painting, with two main types: luminous (chiaroscuro or surface) and chromatic (tonal or saturation). The artist uses contrast to create tonal expression, which can range from soft to hard, and to generate dramatic effects. The correspondence between light and shadow and color is achieved through tonal evaluation. Colors can be lightened or darkened to achieve the desired effect. The light and chromatic harmony of a painting depends on color relationships, which can be harmonized through various methods such as monochrome, trios, warm and cool thermal ranges, complementary colors, and broken ranges. The quality and appearance of the luminous representation is linked to the technique used.
- During the Renaissance, artists began to theorize about the role of light in painting, leading to the development of the pittura di luce style in Florence. This style, characterized by the use of light to create form, atmosphere, and perspective, was exemplified by artists like Masaccio, who used light to create drama and model volume, and Gentile da Fabriano, who distinguished between different types of light sources. Botticelli, while also a pioneer in the use of light, returned to a more symbolic concept of light in his paintings. In Venice, a new pictorial school emerged that focused on the use of canvas, oil painting, and chromaticism, with artists like Bellini making innovative use of light and shadow. The sfumato technique, traditionally attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, was also developed during this time, using progressive glazes and feathering to blur contours and create a sense of depth.
- During the Renaissance, artists began to focus on the role of light in painting, leading to the development of techniques like sfumato, which used progressive glazes and feathering to blur contours and create depth. This technique was used by artists like Leonardo da Vinci, who saw light as essential to giving life and movement to painting. He believed that painting was a composition of light and shadows, and that darkness and light combined created life. Other artists like Raphael also explored innovative lighting solutions, such as dividing scenes into two halves with different lighting resources, or using light to create depth and intensity. These artists used light to enhance their paintings, giving them greater verisimilitude and beauty.
- In Greek art, Apollodorus of Athens pioneered chiaroscuro, a technique of contrasting light and shadow in painting, and Aristotle made early scientific studies on light and color. With the emergence of landscape painting, distance was represented through gradations of light and shadow, creating stronger contrasts closer to the viewer and blurring with distance. This technique was used in early Christian and Byzantine art, as well as in Indian Buddhist murals. The philosopher John Philoponus outlined a theory on the subjective effect of light and shadow in painting, known today as "Philoponus' rule". Hellenistic art favored light effects, and chiaroscuro was widely used in Roman painting, although it disappeared during the Middle Ages. Byzantine art, influenced by Roman art, valued the luminosity and splendor of shines and reflections, with a more aesthetic than pictorial component, identifying them with divine light. Greek and Roman art laid the foundations for classicism, characterized by truthfulness, proportion, and harmony.
- In medieval art, particularly in miniatures and early Gothic painting, light was conjugated through the combination of elementary colors and the use of gold leaf, which generated areas of high intensity light. This "proper light" was considered of divine origin and was used to create a metaphysical space of sacred character, where objects and figures were part of the religious symbolism. The use of gold leaf, often spread over a layer of red clay and polished, provided brilliance and caught the light, while incisions made in the gilding added more luminosity. In contrast to the naturalistic use of light in later periods, early Gothic painting featured a uniform illumination, with no shadows, and gave greater importance to the luminosity of flat color than to tonality. The emergence of oil painting in the Flemish Gothic period allowed for brighter colors and greater detail in the representation of reality. In Italy, a new sensibility towards a more naturalistic representation of reality emerged in the 13th and 14th centuries, which was influenced by the study of realistic light in the pictorial composition, as seen in the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel by Giotto.
- During the Renaissance, artists like Alberti developed theories about the role of light in painting, emphasizing its importance in creating relief, color, and naturalistic representation. Alberti's concepts of circumscriptio, compositio, and luminum receptio influenced Florentine painting, leading to a style known as pittura di luce. Artists such as Domenico Veneziano, Fra Angelico, Paolo Uccello, and Piero della Francesca excelled in this style, using light to create solid forms, serene atmospheres, distinct objects, and spatial definition. They also used light to convey drama, emotion, and symbolism, as seen in Masaccio's frescoes and Piero's night scenes. These artists skillfully combined light and shadow to create depth, volume, and perspective, revolutionizing the art of painting.
- The Posillipo School, Barbizon School, and the Macchiaioli all focused on accurately depicting light in landscapes, with artists like Corot, Boudin, Jongkind, Menzel, Thoma, Perov, Repin, Haes, Riancho, Vayreda, Gigante, and Morelli making significant contributions. The Macchiaioli, in particular, aimed to reduce painting to contrasts of light and brilliance, capturing the power of Mediterranean light. Similarly, the Pre-Raphaelites in Great Britain sought realism through detailed images, vivid colors, and general lighting, often conducting extensive research for their works. In contrast, academic art, also known as art pompier in France, adhered to classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance styles, focusing on careful drawing, formal balance, and realistic coloring. Impressionism, however, prioritized capturing the impression of light on the eye, using outdoor painting and studying optics and the physics of light and color.

- In Christianity, light is a significant symbol that represents various concepts such as divine omnipresence, truth, virtue, salvation, eternity, and heavenly world. It is also associated with Jesus and Mary, representing the Sun and Dawn, respectively. In Orthodox Christianity, light is considered not just a symbol but a "real aspect of divinity." The symbolism of light is used in various forms, including stained glass, halos of saints, and rays of light in paintings to depict divine grace, miracles, or revelations. Over time, the symbolism of light evolved from transcendental or divine light to identifying it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness, or rebirth, and opposing it to ignorance, evil, and death. In the 19th century, German Romantics related light to nature in a pantheistic sense, while in the 20th century, a more scientific view of light prevailed.
- In Byzantine and Romanesque art, there was a focus on the aesthetic value of light, particularly in the form of shines and reflections from gold and precious stones, which were seen as a representation of divine light. This was also true of Gothic art, where light played a strong symbolic role and was often associated with divinity and beauty. The use of stained glass in Gothic architecture, for example, created dynamic plays of light and color within the space of the buildings. In medieval miniatures, light was also important, with bright and brilliant colors used to create luminous images without the need for shading or chiaroscuro. However, in painting, light was not as prominent and did not have a direct connection to reality. The aesthetics of light in medieval art was influenced by scholarly philosophy and scientific advances in optics and the physics of light. In contrast to the "proper light" of medieval art, the "illuminating light" of modern and contemporary art is characterized by a focus on light as a means of illuminating and revealing the subject.
- Religious rituals in various cultures, such as ancient Babylon and with the Pythagoreans, often incorporated "illumination" to purify the soul. In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo, the god of the Sun and beauty, and Eos, the goddess of dawn, are associated with light, which symbolizes life, beauty, and knowledge. In contrast, shadows and darkness are linked to evil, death, and ignorance. This association of light with divinity and goodness is also present in Christianity, where God is identified with light, and Jesus refers to himself as the "light of the world." The Bible begins with "let there be light," and the concept of light as a symbol of divinity is incorporated into Christian churches through the use of eternal lights and candles. Additionally, light symbolizes concepts such as truth, virtue, and salvation in Christianity. In Orthodox Christianity, light is considered not just a symbol but a "real aspect of divinity."

In Italy, a new sensibility towards a more naturalistic representation of reality emerged in the 13th and 14th centuries, which was influenced by the study of realistic light in the pictorial composition, as seen in the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel by Giotto.
- The Caravaggist School of Utrecht, including Terbrugghen, Van Baburen, and Honthorst, trained in Rome and adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects. They developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and compositional schemes. Rembrandt, a symbolic master of light, used a more diffused tenebrism with subtle contrasts and divine connotations. His light is structural, integrated with form, color, and space, and he concentrates it in specific areas to create glowing luminosity. Vermeer, the "painter of light," mastered the synthesis of light and color, capturing the color of light and using it as a protagonist in his works. His light creates calm and placid atmospheres in interior scenes.
- During the Baroque period, artists like Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, Adam Elsheimer, and Georges de La Tour revolutionized the use of light in painting. They employed expressive light and chiaroscuro to emphasize drama and give volume to their scenes. Caravaggio and Gentileschi used sharp contrasts between figures and backgrounds, with darkness as a starting point, while Elsheimer was known for his naturalistic light studies in landscape painting. La Tour specialized in artificial light, particularly lamp or candle light, using it to create dramatic effects and realism. His lighting, while appearing naturalistic, was controlled by his artistic will, serving a more symbolic than realistic purpose. In his later works, La Tour reduced characters to schematic figures to focus on the effects of light on masses and surfaces.
- In Velázquez's "Las hilanderas," light is used to structure space and forms, irregularly illuminating surfaces and creating an illusion of depth. This is similar to how Bartolomé Esteban Murillo employed light in his paintings of the Immaculate Conception, using translucent colors and soft luminosity. During the 18th century, the "Age of Enlightenment," art academies were established to preserve and regulate art, favoring a classical style. Concurrently, the study of optics, including scynography, was pursued, with a focus on the representation of forms produced by shadows.
- Renaissance artists resisted depicting nocturnal scenes due to the need for ample light in linear perspective experiments. However, Leonardo's sfumato technique allowed for a more naturalistic representation of night, which evolved into baroque tenebrism's dramatic use of darkness. In the 17th century, night representation became more scientific, and 19th-century advances in artificial lighting led to nighttime becoming a leisurely period. Light has been associated with beauty, spirituality, and immateriality, while shadows and darkness symbolize evil, death, and ignorance. Many ancient religions identified deities with light, and light has been linked to immortality and purification in religious rites. In Greek mythology, Apollo, the god of the Sun, beauty, and arts, is often depicted within a disk of light, while the shadow has a negative connotation.
- Vermeer, known as the "painter of light," specialized in depicting calm and tranquil interior scenes with a pale luminosity. He used pointillé to enhance objects and create a unique reflection of light on their surfaces. Vermeer's light is natural, with a yellowish tone, and forms the figures and objects in his works. Shadows are integrated into the luminous space, and the painting serves as an organized structure for the circulation and diffusion of light.

In contrast, Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens had different approaches to light. Hals had a Caravaggist phase with a bright and diffuse luminosity, while Jordaens had a style characterized by bright and fantastic coloring with strong contrasts of light and shadow. Between 1625 and 1630, Jordaens deepened the luminous values of his images.

Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou, used artificial candlelight in his works, influenced by Rembrandt.

Landscape painting was a prominent genre in Holland during this century, with artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde specializing in capturing atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water.
- During the Renaissance, particularly in Italy, there was a shift towards a more naturalistic representation of reality, which included the study of light in pictorial composition. Giotto's frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel featured a distinction between flat and curved surfaces through the use of gradients and the orientation of surfaces was indicated by varying tones. Giotto was also the first to represent sunlight in his work. Taddeo Gaddi depicted divine light in a night scene through contrasts of yellow and violet. In the Netherlands, artists such as the van Eyck brothers and Robert Campin focused on capturing various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen. Hubert van Eyck, in particular, developed a sense of saturation of light and created realistic landscapes with subtle light effects. Jan van Eyck captured an atmospheric luminosity in his works and developed the oil painting technique, which gave greater luminosity and depth to the painting. Other Dutch artists, such as Dirk Bouts, Petrus Christus, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, also excelled in the expression of light in their works. The use of canvas and oil painting became widespread during the Renaissance, providing greater chromatic richness and facilitating the representation of light effects. Renaissance light was often intense in the foreground and diminished towards the background.

- During the 17th century, the Dutch developed a unique sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of light in landscape painting, led by artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde. These artists focused on capturing the subtle changes in light and color throughout the day and seasons.

Jacob van Ruysdael, in particular, was known for his expressive depictions of light and shadow, which he used to accentuate the drama of the scene. His assistant, Meindert Hobbema, was known for his contrasting chromatic choices and lively light effects.

Aelbert Cuyp, on the other hand, used a much lighter palette with a warmer and more golden light, influenced by Italian landscape painting. He was known for his atmospheric effects, attention to light reflections on objects, and the use of elongated shadows and backlit sun rays.

In addition to landscape painting, still life was also a prominent genre in Holland during this century. Willem Kalf was one of its best representatives, known for his still lifes with a precise attention to detail, combining luxury objects and foods to create a play of light and shadow.

In Italy, classicism emerged as a reaction against mannerism, with artists such as the Carracci brothers, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Guercino, and Giovanni Lanfranco. These artists sought to represent nature idealizedly, inspired by classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance art. They used light as a paramount factor in the composition of their paintings, with slight nuances depending on the artist.

Claudio de Lorena, a baroque painter, was one of the best at representing light in his works, using it as a plastic factor to organize the composition and create space and time, as well as an aesthetic factor to highlight light as the main sensitive element and create a dream world of ideal perfection.
- The Caravaggist School of Utrecht, including Terbrugghen, Van Baburen, and Honthorst, trained in Rome and adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects.

- During the 17th century, Claudio de Lorena, a Baroque painter from Lorraine, gained recognition for his exceptional use of light in landscape painting. Unlike his contemporaries, Lorena's light was serene and diffused, often coming from the sun and gently illuminating all parts of the painting. He used the horizon line as a vanishing point, arranging a focus of clarity that attracted the viewer and created a sensation of depth. Lorena preferred natural environments and a limpid light of dawn or warm sunset, avoiding sensational effects such as moonlight or storms. His work influenced numerous artists, including Diego Velázquez, who was known for his profound study of pictorial illumination and realism in the representation of his scenes. In contrast, Peter Paul Rubens, a Flemish painter, represented serenity in the face of Tenebrist dramatism and was a master in finding the precise tonality for flesh tones and their different textures. His work combined Mannerist iridescent light and Tenebrist focal light, serving as an organizing element of the composition.
- During the Baroque period, artists like Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, Adam Elsheimer, and Georges de La Tour revolutionized the use of light in painting. They employed expressive light and chiaroscuro to emphasize drama and give volume to their scenes. Caravaggio and Gentileschi used sharp contrasts between figures and backgrounds, with darkness as a starting point, while Elsheimer was known for his naturalistic light studies in landscape painting. La Tour specialized in artificial light, particularly lamp or candle light, using it to create dramatic effects and realism. His lighting, while appearing naturalistic, was controlled by his artistic will, serving a more symbolic than realistic purpose. In his later works, La Tour reduced characters to schematic figures to focus on the effects of light on masses and surfaces.
- In Velázquez's "Las hilanderas," light is used to structure space and forms, irregularly illuminating surfaces and creating an illusion of depth. This is similar to how Bartolomé Esteban Murillo employed light in his paintings of the Immaculate Conception, using translucent colors and soft luminosity. During the 18th century, the "Age of Enlightenment," art academies were established to preserve and regulate art, favoring a classical style. Concurrently, the study of optics, including scynography, was pursued, with a focus on the representation of forms produced by shadows.
- During the 18th century, several art movements emerged, including Rococo in France, which featured illuminated scenes in broad daylight or colorful sunrises and sunsets, as seen in the works of Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin excelled in still life, creating atmospheres and light effects with soft and warm light. Venetian vedutismo, led by Canaletto and Francesco Guardi, focused on urban views with precise details achieved through the use of the camera obscura. Landscape painting gained autonomy with the incorporation of the aesthetic concepts of the picturesque and the sublime, as seen in the works of Michel-Ange Houasse, Claude Joseph Vernet, and Hubert Robert. In England, landscape painting was highly valued, with artists such as Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne, and Thomas Gainsborough capturing the English landscape and its luminous and atmospheric effects. Joseph Wright of Derby was particularly interested in the effects of artificial light, as seen in his masterpiece "Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump."

- The Caravaggist School of Utrecht, including Terbrugghen, Van Baburen, and Honthorst, trained in Rome and adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects. They developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and compositional schemes. Rembrandt, a symbolic master of light, used a more diffused tenebrism with subtle contrasts and divine connotations. His light is structural, integrated with form, color, and space, and he concentrates it in specific areas to create glowing luminosity. Vermeer, the "painter of light," mastered the synthesis of light and color, capturing the color of light and using it as a protagonist in his works. His light creates calm and placid atmospheres in interior scenes.
- During the Baroque period, artists like Caravaggio and his followers, including Artemisia Gentileschi, revolutionized the use of light in painting. Caravaggio's approach to light was innovative and structural, using it to configure space, control direction, and expressive force. He often used sharp contrasts between figures and backgrounds, with darkness as a starting point, making the figures emerge from the dark background. His signature technique was the diagonal entry of light, which he used to great effect in his paintings for the Contarelli chapel. Artemisia Gentileschi, who trained with her father and was influenced by Caravaggio's work, also used expressive light and chiaroscuro to emphasize the drama in her scenes, as seen in her famous painting "Judith beheading Holofernes." Naturalistic tenebrism emerged as a unique style in Italy, focusing on the imitation of natural reality and chiaroscuro, while scientific studies on light significantly influenced its pictorial representation. The "full baroque" period saw painting become more decorative, with a focus on optical effects and luxurious scenographies, and the nocturne genre became popular, requiring the use of artificial light sources. Light was studied as a system of composition and used to articulate the painting, even as a symbolic element, and natural light was used exclusively. Chiaroscuro resurfaced as a method of focusing the viewer's vision on primordial parts of religious paintings, with Caravaggio being a pioneer in the dramatization of light in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light.

In his later works, La Tour reduced characters to schematic figures to focus on the effects of light on masses and surfaces.
- In his later works, La Tour simplified figures to geometric forms, concentrating on light's impact on forms and surfaces. His lighting, while naturalistic in appearance, was controlled artistically for symbolic purposes. La Tour's light is poetic and transcendent, serving a symbolic and compositional role.

Trophime Bigot, another French Caravaggist, mastered artificial light and chiaroscuro. José de Ribera, a Spanish artist in Naples, adopted Caravaggesque light with pasty brushstrokes and dynamic movement. Ribera's early work featured tenebrist illumination, but he later moved to greater chromaticism and clearer backgrounds.

In Spain, Caravaggism was present in Juan Bautista Maíno's colorism and luminosity. The still life painters Juan Sánchez Cotán and Juan van der Hamen also contributed to Spanish naturalism. Francisco de Zurbarán's tenebrism was sweeter, with white color and subtle light-shadow play.

In Venice, Baroque painting was less exceptional but had vibrant luminism and atmospheres. The Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged in Holland, with painters like Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, who adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects. They developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and compositional schemes.
- During the Renaissance and Mannerism periods, artists began experimenting with innovative lighting techniques. Mannerist artists like Rosso Fiorentino and Luca Cambiasso used dramatic and unreal lighting effects, while the Venetian school, known as "tonalism," emerged with a serene style that prioritized luminous values over plastic form. This school, which included artists like Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, used glazes to form images through the modulation of color and light, creating volume with chromatic relationships.

These techniques were adopted and further developed by other Venetian artists, such as the Bassano family and the Lombard illuminists (Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo, Moretto da Brescia), as well as influencing El Greco and Baroque tenebrism. El Greco, who worked in Spain, was particularly known for his use of light, which symbolized the preeminence of faith over unbelief. His lighting techniques evolved from the Venetian school to a more unnatural, arbitrary, and subjective style, rooted in Byzantine art.

In the 17th century, the Baroque style emerged, characterized by refinement, ornamentation, and dynamic and dramatic forms. Baroque painting had a marked geographical differentiation, with different national schools developing distinctive styles. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, for example, was known for his costumist scenes and landscapes that demonstrated a great sensitivity towards nature and the use of direct sunlight as a source of luminosity.
- The Posillipo School, Barbizon School, and the Macchiaioli all focused on accurately depicting light in landscapes, with artists like Corot, Boudin, Jongkind, Menzel, Thoma, Perov, Repin, Haes, Riancho, Vayreda, Gigante, and Morelli making significant contributions. The Macchiaioli, in particular, aimed to reduce painting to contrasts of light and brilliance, capturing the power of Mediterranean light. Similarly, the Pre-Raphaelites in Great Britain sought realism through detailed images, vivid colors, and general lighting, often conducting extensive research for their works. In contrast, academic art, also known as art pompier in France, adhered to classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance styles, focusing on careful drawing, formal balance, and realistic coloring. Impressionism, however, prioritized capturing the impression of light on the eye, using outdoor painting and studying optics and the physics of light and color.
- During the Baroque period, artists like El Greco continued to innovate lighting techniques, building on the work of the Venetian school. El Greco's use of light was mystical and subjective, with a preference for shimmering and incandescent effects achieved through glazes and white highlights. Baroque painting overall became more refined and ornamented, with a focus on dynamic and dramatic forms. There was a geographical differentiation in Baroque painting, with different national schools developing unique styles. In particular, naturalism (or tenebrism) and classicism emerged in Italy, with the former focusing on the imitation of natural reality and chiaroscuro, and the latter having a more intellectual and idealized concept of reality. During the "full baroque" period, painting became more decorative, with a focus on optical effects and luxurious scenographies. Scientific studies on light significantly influenced its pictorial representation, with light being studied as a system of composition and used to articulate the painting. Natural light was used exclusively, even as a symbolic element, and the nocturne genre became popular, requiring the use of artificial light sources. Chiaroscuro resurfaced as a method of focusing the viewer's vision on primordial parts of religious paintings, with Caravaggio being a pioneer in the dramatization of light in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light.
- During the Renaissance and Mannerism periods, artists experimented with innovative lighting techniques, with Mannerist artists like Rosso Fiorentino and Luca Cambiasso using dramatic and unreal lighting effects. Meanwhile, a Venetian school emerged, characterized by a serene style that subordinated plastic form to luminous values, as seen in the works of Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. This school, known as "tonalism," consisted of superimposing glazes to form the image through the modulation of color and light, with chromatic relationships creating effects of volume. Giorgione, considered a founder of "modern painting," was an innovator in landscape painting and evoking moods, while Titian was known for his vibrant atmospheres and subtle shades of light. Tintoretto painted by candlelight, creating deep atmospheres with violent artificial light effects, influencing other Venetian artists and Baroque tenebrism. Paolo Veronese was heir to the luminism of Giovanni Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio, using dense morning lights in Palladian architecture scenes.

- During the late 19th century, several artists from various countries, including the United States, explored the representation of light in their art. These artists, sometimes referred to as "luminists," emphasized light in their works, often using impressionist techniques. In the United States, Thomas Cole, considered the pioneer of the Hudson River School, aimed to create an elevated style of landscape with a moral message. Durand, known for his intimate and picturesque vision of nature, painted natural landscapes after turning away from engraving. Church, Cole's first disciple, reflected a majestic and exuberant nature in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner and captured atmospheric effects in his works. Heade was devoted to country landscapes with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism, focusing on the landscape of his native Gloucester with a placid light that gives a sense of eternity. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade. Bingham masterfully captured the limpid and clear light of dawn in his scenes of the Far West. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, with a special interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day. Belgian and Dutch luminism also emerged during this time, with artists such as Émile Claus and Jan Toorop adopting impressionist techniques and focusing on the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions.
- In the 19th century, French artist Eugène Delacroix and English painters John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner were prominent figures in the art world. Delacroix, influenced by Rubens and the Venetian school, developed a proto-impressionist style, focusing on patches of light and color. Constable, known for capturing atmospheric phenomena, was credited with the invention of the "chiaroscuro of nature" and had a technique of interrupted strokes and touches of pure white. Turner, with his great intuition for light, created dramatic environments with a colored light that dissolved forms, making his works visually realistic. Richard Parkes Bonington, a British watercolorist and lithographer, and Caspar David Friedrich, a German painter with a pantheistic vision of nature, were also notable artists of the time.
- During the late 19th century, various artists from different countries, including Russia, Spain, the United States, and several European countries, explored the representation of light in their art. These artists, sometimes referred to as "luminists," emphasized light in their works, often using impressionist techniques. In Russia, Korovin painted both urban and natural landscapes with a personal style that elevated chromatic impressions to art. Spanish artists Beruete and Regoyos, trained in realism, adopted impressionist techniques after studying in France. American Luminism, characterized by polished realism and atmospheric effects achieved through careful tonal gradations, featured artists such as Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, and Frederic Edwin Church. Cole, considered the pioneer of the Hudson River School, aimed to create an elevated style of landscape with a moral message. Durand, known for his intimate and picturesque vision of nature, painted natural landscapes after turning away from engraving.
- In the 19th century, Caspar David Friedrich, a German painter, is known for his pantheistic and poetic vision of nature, often depicting uncorrupted and idealized landscapes with a human figure as a spectator. He is considered a precursor of impressionism due to his atmospheric sensibility, delicate treatment of light and color, and sure contours. His notable works include "The Cross on the Mountain" (1808), "Memorial Image for Johann Emanuel Bremer" (1817), and "Woman at Sunrise" (1818-1820). Friedrich often used natural phenomena symbolically, such as dawn and dusk representing birth and death. Meanwhile, Norwegian artist Johan Christian Dahl followed Friedrich's style but with a greater focus on naturalistic light and atmospheric effects, particularly in the sky and clouds. Georg Friedrich Kersting, on the other hand, applied Friedrich's mysticism to interior scenes, illuminating them with soft lamp or candle light. Philipp Otto Runge developed his own color theory, distinguishing between opaque and transparent colors based on their relationship with light and darkness.
- During the 18th century, English landscape painting emphasized capturing the atmosphere, with prominent artists like Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne, and Thomas Gainsborough. Joseph Wright of Derby was particularly interested in light, specifically artificial light, which he masterfully depicted in his "candle light pictures." Wright used light symbolically to represent reason and knowledge, as seen in "Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump" (1768). In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Francisco de Goya evolved from a Rococo style to a personal form of preromanticism. Goya's work often used light metaphorically to represent reason and freedom, contrasted with darkness symbolizing ignorance and repression. He also had a fondness for nocturnal atmospheres and tenebrism. In his mature work, "Los fusilamientos del 3 de mayo de 1808 en la Moncloa" (1814), Goya uses a night scene and a beacon's reflection to symbolize death and the innocent victim in the face of barbarism.
- In the 19th century, several German artists like Johan Christian Dahl, Georg Friedrich Kersting, and Philipp Otto Runge, were influenced by Caspar David Friedrich's pantheistic and symbolic approach to nature, but each brought their unique interpretations. Dahl focused on naturalistic light and atmospheric effects, especially in the sky and clouds, creating a more realistic landscape. Kersting applied Friedrich's mysticism to interior scenes, illuminating them with soft lamp or candle light, giving a solemn and mysterious air. Runge developed his own color theory, distinguishing between opaque and transparent colors, which he used to highlight figures and create a psychological effect, emphasizing the mystical character of nature.

The Nazarene movement, active between 1810 and 1830, adopted a style inspired by Renaissance classicism with an emphasis on religious themes. Their style was characterized by diaphanous luminosity and a preponderance of drawing over color.

In Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Biedermeier style emerged, a more naturalistic tendency between romanticism and realism. Artists like Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Johann Erdmann Hummel, Carl Blechen, Carl Spitzweg, and Moritz von Schwind each had their unique approach to light, from stylizing elements to capturing subtle effects, creating resplendent clarity, and using light as a psychological element.

In Spain, Jenaro Pérez Villaamil became the first professor of landscape painting at the San Fernando Academy, influenced by English landscape painting, characterized by neat drawing, graceful line, and picturesque and archaeological perspective.

In Italy, the Posillipo School emerged, a group of anti-academic Neapolitan landscape painters who showed a new concern for light in the landscape, with a more truthful aspect, far from the classical canons, characterized by shimmering effects and solid drawing.

Christen Købke, a Danish artist, is known for his delicate light in landscapes, reminiscent of the Pointillé of Vermeer or the luminosity of Gerrit Berckheyde.
- In the 19th century, art evolved rapidly, leading to the emergence of modern art in contrast to academic art. Photography and advancements in artificial light, such as gaslight, kerosene, and electricity, brought about a new understanding of light's role in visual perception. Romanticism, the first style of the century, emphasized spirituality, fantasy, sentiment, love of nature, and the artist's emotions.

Pierre-Paul Prud'hon was a French artist who combined neoclassicism with a rococo influence, focusing on feminine voluptuousness and using dim, twilight, and lunar light in his mythological paintings. Landscape painting, considered minor by neoclassicals, had prominent figures in Germany, such as Joseph Anton Koch, Ferdinand Kobell, and Wilhelm von Kobell. Koch's Alpine landscapes captured cloudy atmospheres and natural light, while Ferdinand Kobell's realistic landscapes featured intense contrasts and translucent light. Wilhelm von Kobell followed his father's style with a greater focus on light and hard, metallic figures.

Romanticism, with its emphasis on emotion, spirituality, and nature, used expressive techniques and valued the figure of the "genius." William Blake, a pre-Romantic artist, created nocturnal images with unreal, liquid light. Johann Heinrich Füssli, another pre-Romantic, used strong contrasts and theatrical lighting in his dreamlike images. Théodore Géricault, an early Romantic, used light symbolically in his masterpiece, "The Raft of the Medusa." Eugène Delacroix, a prominent Romantic painter, was influenced by Rubens, the Venetian school, and John Constable, and developed a proto-impressionist style during his travels to Morocco. In landscape painting, John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner excelled, capturing atmospheric phenomena and light effects.

- During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, luminism developed in several countries, with artists capturing light in various ways. In Spain, Joaquín Sorolla mastered capturing the warm Mediterranean light, particularly in seascapes, and later adopted a more nuanced tonality and pointillist technique. The Sitges School in Catalonia, active from 1878 to 1892, preferred the vibrant Mediterranean light and atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast, creating harmonious compositions with subtle chromaticism and fluid brushstrokes. Symbolism, an artistic movement that emerged as a reaction to naturalism, used light symbolically to suggest spirituality or emotion, rather than as an objective representation of the material world.
- In the late 19th century, various artists explored the use of light, color, and brushwork in their art. In Italy, artists like Tranquillo Cremona, Mosè Bianchi, and Daniele Ranzoni used chromatic vibrations and blurred contours to depict their emotions, while Giovanni Segantini combined academic drawing with post-impressionist coloring and a focus on high-altitude light effects. In Germany, Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt explored impressionism with unique sensitivities to light, often influenced by their native regions. James Abbott McNeil Whistler in Great Britain created foggy, night scenes with artificial light effects, while John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam in the United States contributed with their distinct styles. Scandinavian impressionists, many trained in Paris, had a special sensitivity to light, often focusing on complex lighting effects and romantic themes. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin were known for their bright, vibrant chromatism and light reflections, while in Spain, Aureliano de Beruete and Darío de Regoyos adopted impressionist techniques in their Castilian and French landscapes.

The Netherlands saw a luminist school influenced by incipient Fauvism, with artists like Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, and Jan Sluyters. In Germany, Max Liebermann developed a personal luminism with violent brushstrokes and brilliant light. Spanish luminism, particularly in Valencia and Catalonia, was led by Joaquín Sorolla, who mastered capturing light in nature, especially in seascapes. Sorolla's style evolved from rapid genre themes with thick brushstrokes to a more nuanced tonality and pointillist technique, always focusing on the subtleties of light.

- In the early 20th century, Belgrade had a variety of popular kafanas and hotels, each with unique features and offerings. "Srpska kruna," known as the "people's university," was particularly notable and was replaced by "Park" restaurant after its demolition. However, "Park" later burned down in 2012. Other famous kafanas included "Babuna," "Bajlonijeva kafana," "Boem," "Bulevar," "Bums Keler," "Cvetkova mehana," and "Čukareva kafana," each with their own distinct characteristics and histories. In 1927, the Ministry of Finance banned nightlife after 23:00, imposing fines on those who stayed out past 11 PM. The text highlights the significance of these venues in Belgrade's social and cultural life, as well as the changes that occurred over time.
- After the economic collapse in the late 1980s, many traditional kafanas in Belgrade, such as "Atina," "Buffet of Hotel Bristol," "Grgeč," "Kasina," "Lion," "Mihajlovac," "Promaja," and "Tri lista duvana," have closed or been transformed. These kafanas were once gathering places for diverse groups, including journalists, writers, opera singers, actors, athletes, professional gamblers, and politicians. Some, like "Atina" and "Grgeč," were transformed into modern restaurants or stores, while others, like "Promaja," were forcefully demolished. This marked the end of an era in Belgrade's social life, as these kafanas were replaced by new commercial buildings or modern restaurants.
- By the 18th century, Belgrade had many kafanas and meyhanas, with a significant number in the German sector serving beer and the Serbian sector serving wine and rakia. Zemun, although historically separate, had its own establishments, including the White Bear Tavern. The term "kafana" comes from the Persian qahvah–khanah, meaning "coffee house." In the 19th century, kafanas became important social institutions in Belgrade, with various types offering different services and becoming gathering spots for different groups. They served as centers of political and cultural life, with some even turning into debate clubs for political parties. The codification of hospitality objects in 1847 and 1863 established rules for kafanas, including the prohibition of women ownership and work in certain types of kafanas. The White Bear Tavern in Zemun is considered the oldest surviving building in urban Belgrade, while the House at 10 Cara Dušana Street in Dorćol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade.
- After the economic collapse in the late 1980s, many traditional kafanas in Belgrade, including "Tri lista duvana," "Vidin kapija," "Zora," and "Žagubica," have closed or been transformed, marking the end of an era in Belgrade's social life. These kafanas were once gathering places for various groups and had cultural and historical significance. Some, like "Tri lista duvana," were famous and had a significant impact on the city's culture and history. They were replaced by new commercial buildings or modern restaurants. The kafanas were described as the first democratic space in the new society, open to everyone without the need for an invitation or membership.
- The first kafana, an oriental-style bistro serving Turkish coffee, opened in Belgrade in 1522, a year after the Ottoman conquest, making it possibly the oldest such venue in Europe. By the 18th century, Belgrade had around 200 kafanas and meyhanas, with a significant number in the German sector serving beer and the Serbian sector serving wine and rakia. The nightlife was known for its excesses, with the aristocracy using commoners as entertainment at balls and imposing hefty entry fees.

These barges played a significant role in Belgrade's nightlife, with some becoming associated with criminal activity and others becoming symbols of the techno and rave scene.
- In the 1970s, Belgrade's nightlife scene evolved further with the emergence of modernized kafanas and popular disco clubs, such as "Youth Center", "Go-Go Dancing" in Tašmajdan, and "Disco Club 2
- In the 19th century, kafanas in Belgrade evolved into various types, each catering to different groups such as craftsmen, farmers, and traders. Some kafanas even became debate clubs for political parties. The first hotel, "Kod jelena," was built in 1843 and introduced European entertainment traditions. Kafanas allowed patrons to stay the night, and the first electrified streetlamp in 1893 marked the beginning of "proper nightlife." The kafanas had creative names, some referencing nearby buildings or businesses. The "Amerika" kafana was notorious for prostitution, while the "Balkan" hotel was a meeting place for businesspeople and one of the few places where women could work.
- The "splavovi" or river barges gained popularity in Belgrade's nightlife in the 1980s, with "Hua Hua" being the most popular one. The first splavovi opened for visitors in the late 1970s, and the trend continued to grow, with over 200 cafes, restaurants, kafanas, and discos on the barges by 2021. The 1990s saw a shift towards turbo-folk music and criminalization of the clubs, with splavovi becoming the dominant nightlife venues. The first purposely built barge-discotheque, "Pingvin," opened in 1988, and was later renamed to "Estrada," which became a gathering point for criminal clans. Meanwhile, "Nana," originally an elegant nightclub, became a favorite place for foreign diplomats before it was taken over by criminals. The splavovi expanded to Staro Sajmište in the second half of the 1990s, but all barges were moved out by the late 2010s due to public conflicts. Despite international sanctions, electronic music venues and a techno and rave scene developed in the second half of the 1990s.
- In the 1980s, several new exclusive clubs were established in Belgrade, each with its unique features and clientele. "Duga," opened in 1981, was the most exclusive venue, known for its strict dress code, expensive prices, and famous patrons. It was followed by the opening of other clubs such as "Bezistan," "Bona fides," "Crveni podijum," "Cvetni Breg," "London," "Panorama," and "Šestica." These clubs were popular gathering places for various groups, including university students and workers. At the same time, the "splavovi" or river barges emerged as a new trend in Belgrade's nightlife, with "Argument" and "Hua Hua" being the most popular ones. However, the 1990s brought calamities such as wars, economic sanctions, and the collapse of the standard of living, marking a significant shift in Belgrade's nightlife culture.
- After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to decline. However, new types of gathering places, such as night clubs or "disko[teka]" in Serbian, started to emerge in the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. The penetration of rock and roll was slow at first, but it gained momentum and became popular among the youth. The first night clubs were small and located in private houses and apartments, with city authorities often trying to close them down. One of the pioneer promoters of rock and roll was Nikola Karaklajić, a chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. The first proper disco in Belgrade, "Kod Laze Šećera", was opened in 1967, followed by the Belgrade Youth Center's discothèque "202" in 1969. The public reaction to rock and roll and the accompanying way of dancing or dressing was generally cold and indifferent, with older generations not perceiving it as a problem. Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, and no one stopped the creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS ("vocal-instrumental band").
- The 1980s saw the emergence of various clubs in Belgrade, each with its unique features and clientele. Notable ones include "Akademija," a rock and roll venue for rebels, and "Zvezda," its fancy rival with a strict dress code. "Duga," another exclusive club, aimed to gather the rich and famous. Meanwhile, "Akvarijus" and "Cepelin" from the 1970s continued to attract patrons with their unique atmospheres. By this time, DJs had become stars, with Zoran Modli being one of the most popular. The "Akademija" club, open until 2011, was particularly influential, shaping the culture of having fun in Belgrade.
- The text mentions several clubs that were significant in Belgrade's nightlife scene, each with its own unique characteristics and clientele. "Magna House," later "Gradonačelnik," was originally a hangout for a particular group (šminkeri) but became known for attracting criminals. "Omen," located at 16 Obilićev Venac Street, was a small techno rave club popular among DJs for its intimate atmosphere and pinball machines. "Pećina," situated at the entry into the Tašmajdan's lagums, was the location of the "Ovo je moj grad" festival. "Sara," a barge on Ada Ciganlija, was the first venue with solely electronic music, open for only a year in 1994. "Soul Food," at 6 Francuska Street, was labeled as the first club with a strictly defined concept, shaped by dance music. "Triton," a splav, was a large venue and one of the most popular at the time, known for numerous shootouts. "Trozubac," located between Terazije and Nušićeva Street, was a gathering place for criminals. "Tube," located at the corner of Simina and Dobračina streets, is also mentioned. Other notable clubs mentioned earlier in the text include "Industrija," "Underground," "Energija," "Luv," "Dolar," and "Kuća."

## correct

False



## question

Inferring from the context, why did the government not support the opening of the club in the 1960s?

## ground_truth

The city government believes that the unhealthy atmosphere in the clubs affects the youth and does not support the existence of the clubs.

## generated_answer

 The government did not support the opening of clubs in the 1960s due to their association with American music, which was labeled as "capitalist fun that spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies." Additionally, trucking was officially banned in 1946, and by 1951, boogie-woogie and jazz were attacked by state propaganda.

- After the economic collapse in the 1980s, traditional kafanas in Belgrade, which held cultural and historical significance, began to decline. These kafanas served as the first democratic space in the new society and played a significant role in Belgrade's history, hosting numerous firsts such as the first bank, exchange office, labor market, stock exchange, insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio, and more. They also served as gathering places and recruitment centers for various wars and rebellions, and regular meeting places for young officers who plotted coups and ended dynasties.

In the early 20th century, the first intercity phone line was established, connecting "Kolarac" in Belgrade to the city of Niš. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1910, and by the 1910s, members of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, including Gavrilo Princip, gathered in the "Zlatna Moruna" and planned their actions, including the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914.

In the 1900s, the first individual public clock was placed in front of the "Kod Albanije" and the first book fair in the city was held at "Kolarac". Elementary schools were established in existing kafanas, such as "Gavrilović" and "Lavadinović".

During the Communist regime after World War II, new types of music were promoted, but by the end of 1945, American music was labeled as "capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies". Trucking was officially banned in the early 1946 and by 1951, boogie-woogie and jazz were attacked by the state propaganda.

The first night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. The penetration of rock and roll was slow at first, but gained momentum and became popular among the youth.

As of 2023, on the administrative territory of Belgrade, there were 18 former or still operational catering and tourist facilities which were declared cultural monuments. Various neighborhoods and buildings
- The first barge with a DJ, "Duga," had a separate dance floor and seating booths, initially attracting a diverse crowd but later becoming a gathering place for criminals from Zemun and New Belgrade. Similarly, "Nana," originally an elegant nightclub, became known for not playing folk music and attracting foreign diplomats, but later became notorious for a murder connected to criminals and the secret police. "Lukas," opened in 1985, gained popularity in the 1990s and became a gathering place for two criminal clans, resulting in shootouts.

These barges played a significant role in Belgrade's nightlife, with some becoming associated with criminal activity and others becoming symbols of the techno and rave scene.
- In the early 20th century, Belgrade had a variety of popular kafanas and hotels, each with unique features and offerings. "Srpska kruna," known as the "people's university," was particularly notable and was replaced by "Park" restaurant after its demolition. However, "Park" later burned down in 2012. Other famous kafanas included "Babuna," "Bajlonijeva kafana," "Boem," "Bulevar," "Bums Keler," "Cvetkova mehana," and "Čukareva kafana," each with their own distinct characteristics and histories. In 1927, the Ministry of Finance banned nightlife after 23:00, imposing fines on those who stayed out past 11 PM. The text highlights the significance of these venues in Belgrade's social and cultural life, as well as the changes that occurred over time.
- After the decline of traditional kafanas in Belgrade due to the economic downturn in the 1980s, new gathering places like night clubs emerged in the 1960s. The first disco in Belgrade, "Kod Laze Šećera" (Lola), opened in 1967, introducing a new wave of nightlife. Meanwhile, KST, an unofficial student club, was established in 1952 and officially recognized in 1954, later opening a disco in 1968. KST was the first disco in Yugoslavia and a popular spot for both locals and international jet-set members. In the 1970s, Belgrade's nightlife began to evolve with the emergence of modern kafanas and several popular disco clubs, such as "Youth Center", "Go-Go Dancing" in Tašmajdan and "Disco Club 202" in the old synagogue in Zemun. However, all youth venues had expensive tickets. At the same time, SKC, short for "Studentski Kulturni Centar", was opened in 1968 and became the central stage of the alternative cultural life in Belgrade, hosting avant-garde artists and alternative rock music.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Belgrade's kafanas, such as "Srpska kruna," were important social venues with specific offerings and famous patrons. "Srpska kruna," known as the "people's university," held billiard tables, attracted notable guests like Vojislav Ilić and Branislav Nušić, and was affectionately named after its reputation as a hub for learning and discussion. When it was set to close, regulars held a solemn farewell ceremony. After its demolition in 1901, patrons moved to other popular kafanas, like "Velika Srbija" and Skadarlija, which became the city's central nightlife spot. As of 2023, "Tri šešira" remains the oldest operational kafana in Skadarlija.

- In the early 20th century, Belgrade had numerous kafanas, each with its unique features and histories, which significantly contributed to the city's social and cultural life. Notable kafanas include "Takovo," frequently visited by actors, with composer Stevan Mokranjac as a regular. "Topola" was popular among lawyers, who visited with their clients to write claims and complaints. "Zeleni Venac," originally a hatmaker's widow's house, was renamed after the tin-made green wreath hanging on its façade and became a favorite place of the Liberals. "Zlatna lađa," built by wealthy merchant Miša Anastasijević, was a meeting place for merchants and prominent people. "Zlatni krst" was the first cinema in Belgrade and a favorite place for politicians after the Serbian-Turkish wars. "Zlatni šaran" was known for its fish meals and hosted famous mathematician Mihailo Petrović's musical group. "Župa," located in Jajinci, was the first modern traffic sign's location and had the first concrete paved street in Belgrade. Zemun had numerous kafanas around the quarantine hospital, Kontumac, between 1730 to 1871, such as "Kod zlatnog krsta," "Kod zlatnog točka," "Kod cara," "Kod zlatnog slona," and "Kod zlatnog sunca." After World War II, nightlife dwindled, and new kafanas, like "Mladi Proleter," "Sinđelić," "Obilić," and "Stadion," became centers of nightlife in the 1950s-1960s, often with footballers and other athletes as clientele.
- After World War II, a restaurant was established in 1970 on an older ship called "Split," originally built in 1892 as the luxurious paddle steamer "Emperor Nicholas II" for the Serbian Royal Navy Society. The ship was used for diplomatic missions and was later docked under the Branko's Bridge, serving as a restaurant with private rooms used for prostitution. In the 1960s, Belgrade's nightlife evolved, but traditional kafanas, like those in Skadarlija, remained significant. Skadarlija, known as Belgrade's bohemian quarter, began developing in the 1830s and acquired its bohemian character in the late 19th century. By the early 20th century, there were 15 kafanas, with three originals still standing today. The area was restored in 1968, preserving its historical features and reestablishing its status as a bohemian hub. Skadarlija is now the second most visited attraction in Belgrade, attracting foreign tourists and artists.

In the UK, Julian Cole was left in a vegetative state after being struck with excessive force during an arrest in 2013, and Mzee Mohammed died in police custody in 2016. In the US, there have been numerous cases of police brutality, particularly against black individuals, such as the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in Iraq and the killing of Breonna Taylor. The text highlights concerns about police accountability and the disproportionate number of black people affected by police violence. The US has a significantly higher number of police killings compared to other Western countries, with a far greater number of black people being killed by police.

- The text discusses police brutality in various countries, with a focus on Greece, Hungary, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. In Greece, there have been numerous incidents of police brutality during protests, often resulting in severe injuries and a lack of medical assistance for victims. Hungary's police academy requires a high school diploma, a matriculation exam, and two years of study, which is longer than some countries but lacks sufficient practical training. Northern Ireland has a history of police brutality, particularly during the Troubles, and there are ongoing concerns about harassment and discrimination against Catholics. The Republic of Ireland's police force, the Garda Síochána, allows "reasonable force" but has faced international concern over excessive use of force and has implemented new procedures to address these issues. Italy has also faced issues with police brutality, including beatings, violence during demonstrations, and several murders. The text emphasizes the need for accountability, improved training, and addressing systemic issues to prevent police brutality.

It highlights the severe injuries and lack of medical assistance for victims, as well as the use of tactics such as human shields. Specific examples are given of protesters and journalists who have suffered injuries due to police actions. The text also briefly mentions police brutality in Hungary and its history of discrimination against the Roma minority, as well as the issue of police brutality in Northern Ireland. It is urged that authorities investigate these incidents and hold those responsible accountable, and improve police training programs to ensure ethical judgments and proportional use of force.
- In Uganda, under President Idi Amin's regime, many people were killed and tortured, including minority groups. In South Africa, police brutality has been a persistent issue, with a significant increase in incidents and custodial deaths from 2011 to 2012. The high cost of civil liabilities due to police misconduct has also been a concern. In Egypt, police brutality was a major factor in the 2011 revolution, and there have been continued reports of excessive force, torture, and a lack of justice for victims. In Bangladesh, there have been instances of lethal force used against peaceful protesters, such as the 1952 Dhaka protests and the 2017 Shahbag protests. In China, politically motivated protests have been met with force, and there have been reports of social media being used to mobilize protesters.
- The text discusses incidents of police brutality in various countries, including Finland and Germany. In Finland, despite having a relatively law-abiding police force, there have been cases of police officers committing crimes while on duty, with the number of such cases increasing annually. The types of crimes committed by police officers include traffic-related offenses, excessive force, and even rape. In Germany, there is a pattern of police ill-treatment towards foreigners and ethnic minorities, with high-profile cases of police brutality reported as far back as the 1960s. The text also mentions the yellow vests protests in France, which began due to an increased fuel tax and were marked by violence and allegations of excessive force by law enforcement personnel.

- The text describes incidents of police brutality in Latvia, both past and present. During the Soviet occupation from 1940 to 1991, the Soviet militsiya, which had a militarized approach and lacked transparency, replaced the previous police system. After Latvia's independence in 1991, the police were restructured, but issues of police brutality persisted, particularly towards the Russian population. In 1998, police forces were accused of using excessive force against a Russian rally. In 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies found instances of brutality and corruption within the police, and a study by the center received numerous complaints about police misconduct. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture has also reported cases of police brutality within the Latvian prison system. However, the number of allegations for poor treatment has decreased over the years. The text highlights the need for continued efforts to address police brutality and ensure accountability in Latvia.

The text highlights the need for accountability and justice in addressing police brutality in Italy.
- The text describes several instances of police brutality in Austria, including a Serbian Romani man and a black Austrian citizen being physically abused by police officers, and a Nigerian asylum-seeker who suffocated while being deported. There has been a lack of accountability for these actions, with very few officers being brought to justice and many complainants facing counter-charges. From 2014 to 2015, there were 250 accusations of police misconduct in Vienna with none resulting in charges. The culture of excusing police misconduct continues, with complaints often met with inadequate investigations. The text also mentions the use of body cameras by Austrian police as a measure to prevent police brutality and the proposal by Amnesty International to disband Vienna's riot police and adopt a National Action Plan against Racism. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are incorporated in Belgian law.
- The text discusses issues of police brutality and misconduct in several European countries, particularly against minority communities. In Russia, police have been accused of using torture to extract false confessions and disproportionately using violence against protesters. Slovakian police have a history of systematic brutality towards the Romani minority, which is reflective of the nation's institutionalized racism towards them. In Slovenia, minority groups, especially the Roma and former Yugoslav Republic residents, face discrimination and brutality by the police. The Romani, in particular, are often stereotyped as criminals and are vulnerable to police abuse due to their lack of legal status and rights. In all these countries, investigations into police misconduct are often inadequate, and officers are rarely held accountable for their actions.
- The text discusses specific incidents of police brutality in Italy, which have resulted in deaths and injuries. In response to these events, there have been arrests and convictions of some officers, but not all incidents have been fully addressed. For example, in the case of Carlo Giuliani's death in 2001, no one was held responsible. Similarly, in the case of Riccardo Rasman's death in 2007, the officers involved received light sentences. The text emphasizes the need for accountability and justice in addressing police brutality. The Garda Síochána in the Republic of Ireland has also faced concerns over excessive use of force, and the government has implemented new procedures to address these issues, including a new complaints procedure, disciplinary procedures, and whistle-blowing protections.
- The 2015/2016 Amnesty International report criticized the excessive force used by Portuguese police against migrant and minority communities, including 14 young black men's deaths since 2001 without police accountability. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has repeatedly raised concerns about police mistreatment of minorities, attributing it to institutional racism and recommending oversight by an independent body. Roma people have also been victims of police harassment and brutality. Russian police have been accused of using torture techniques to extract false confessions and disproportionately using violence against protesters, particularly during the 2012 reelection of Vladimir Putin and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Slovakian police brutality is systematic and primarily targets the Romani minority, reflecting the nation's historical and systemic racism towards them.
- The text describes several incidents of alleged police brutality in Italy, leading to deaths and injuries. In the case of Gabriele Sandri, a policeman opened fire and killed him during a fight between football supporters, receiving a sentence of nine years and five months, but was released early. Giuseppe Uva died after being arrested and signs of violence were found on his body, but no officers were charged. Stefano Cucchi was arrested for selling transparent packaging and was beaten, resulting in his death a week later. Two officers were sentenced to twelve years in jail for manslaughter in 2019.

- The COVID-19 pandemic did not reduce police violence in Brazil, as police killings increased by 27.9% compared to 2019. In the first months of the pandemic, Rio's police killed 741 people, the highest rate in 22 years. In response, 17 organizations from social movements and human rights groups entered a petition called ADPF 635 in Brazil's Supreme Court, demanding actions to minimize police terror in communities. The risings deaths and abuse cases led to the immediate suspension of police operations during the pandemic. The Supreme Court unanimously voted to maintain the decision, which prohibits police operations in "absolutely exceptional" cases, and restricts the use of helicopters, operations near schools and hospitals, and body remotion. After the suspension of police operations, mortality rates and criminality rates decreased. The decision was celebrated as a significant step towards justice and the struggle of lives in favelas.

In Belgium, there have been several instances of police violence, including the death of Jonathan Jacob in 2010 and the detainment of Roman Protasevich in Belarus in 2021. The Belgian police have been criticized for using excessive force, failing to report ill-treatment, and not complying with international human rights standards. The Belgian League of Human Rights has been monitoring police brutality through the Observatory of Police Violence. In contrast, Croatia has a centralized police force that is prohibited from using torture, mistreatment, and cruel and degrading punishment. However, the Croatian police's history as a militarized force during the country's secession from Yugoslavia has affected their philosophy and behavior in using excessive force.
