The market was a major part of the global meat trade, with livestock coming from various parts of Europe and America. The gut girls were described as cheerful and unruly, but most tried to conceal their employment at the market.\n\nForrest Capie and Richard Perren noted that although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were just terminal stations of a great network of German railway lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before reaching their port of embarkation. Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s, after the British authorities realized that too much livestock was coming from places where disease was endemic. The United States had become the main supplier, with nearly all American livestock exports going to England. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West, where early Western cattle, though hardy, made tough eating. American shippers exported their best animals, as they were better able to absorb the cost of carriage. Western cattlemen improved their stock to capture lucrative markets, and the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle. The Hereford bull, in particular, increased the size and quality of range cattle. Comparable improvements were made in sheep. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West.

Improved technology and logistics allowed for the transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the American West to Deptford for \u00a310 or \u00a312. English adventurer Moreton Frewen imported cattle from as far as Oregon, and British investors were attracted to the West due to its high profits.

This shift was due to the Argentine beef industry's transformation, which involved selective breeding and the introduction of alfalfa forage, resulting in high-quality cattle. From around 1888, live cattle and sheep were shipped from Buenos Aires as deck cargo to London.\n\nHowever, the live meat trade faced challenges. The journey was long and difficult, causing significant losses during transportation. In 1895, the Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, resulted in only 32 animals arriving alive, leading to the vessel being prohibited from carrying live stock for a year. Additionally, the Beef Trust, a cartel of large Chicago meat packers, controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America by the early 20th century. They were accused of buying up shops in Smithfield Market, fixing British beef prices, and controlling lairages at Deptford Market, which negatively impacted the market.\n\nAnimal welfare during these journeys was also a concern. \"Wild, untamed brutes\" struggled with the sea voyage and had to be tamed and taught to eat hay in advance. The live meat trade from Argentina to Deptford was eventually closed in 1900 due to foot-and-mouth disease and was replaced by the importation of good chilled Argentine beef, causing severe unemployment in Deptford.\n\nThe Australasian live trade also suffered from \"terrible\" losses, with 607 cattle and 57 sheep lost out of the total shipped.

An inquiry was set up to investigate the control and effect of meat supply, distribution, and price in the United Kingdom, which reported in 1909 and found the allegations to be generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef. Animal welfare during transportation was also a significant issue, with animals experiencing stress and injury, even in current times. In the early days of shipping cattle across the Atlantic, conditions were poor, especially in tramp steamers, and animals suffered from jettisoning or dying from injury or suffocation.

Plimsoll advocated for abolition, but his campaign led to improved regulations instead. In Canada, the trade was described as wasteful and unprofitable, with animals arriving in poor condition. Plimsoll argued that the trade had no rational commercial purpose, as imported beef could be cheaper, easier, and in better condition.

Perren acknowledged that fraud existed in the chilled meat trade, with some butchers selling Deptford-killed meat as English for a higher price. However, effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933. The transatlantic cattle trade led to cheaper bread due to the need for ballast in vessels carrying cattle, which was often filled with American grain.
