WEAF was successful with a regular schedule of programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs. In 1923, RCA attempted to transmit audio between cities via telegraph lines, but it failed due to interference. AT&T sold WEAF and its embryonic network to RCA in 1925, allowing RCA to use AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. RCA, GE, and Westinghouse then created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1926, which was split into the Red and Blue Networks in 1927, focusing on commercially sponsored entertainment and non-sponsored broadcasts, respectively. NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks in 1927 and 1931, carrying Red and Blue Network programming.

NBC, on the other hand, became home to many popular performers and programs during the golden age of radio. However, in the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies, leading to many NBC performers, including Jack Benny, jumping to CBS. NBC stars also began migrating to television, causing a decline in NBC's radio programming.

NBC then launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), providing all-news radio to local stations, but it was discontinued due to profitability concerns. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a secondary network providing news and features to FM rock stations. NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call-in national talk radio with TalkNet, which, despite not being a ratings success, helped further the national talk radio format.

NBC Radio News moved to Mutual's Arlington, Virginia, facility, with engineering operations and the affiliate relations department following suit. Further consolidation in 1992 led to joint production of newscasts during overnights and weekends, and both networks airing generic sportscasts. In 1994, Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting, which then acquired 25% of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity was subsequently acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1996, leading to CBS Radio Network falling under Westwood One management. The Mutual/NBC newsroom in Arlington closed in 1998, with CBS Radio News originating \"NBC\"-branded newscasts from New York. Westwood One launched NBC News Radio in 2003, which became a full-time operation in 2012 after acquiring Dial Global. NBC Sports Radio was launched in 2014 as a Dial Global/NBC Sports joint venture but ended 24/7 programming in 2018 and was shut down in 2020.

However, NBC made history by broadcasting professional football and baseball games, and covering special events like President Roosevelt's speech at Madison Square Garden in 1940. The first commercial television broadcasts began in July 1941, with WNBT airing the first paid advertisement for Bulova watches. Prior to this, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis, with NBC's earliest examples seen during the first televised baseball game in 1939.

On V-E Day in 1945, WNBT broadcast extensive news coverage and remotes from New York City, promoting the event in advance.\n\nPost-war, NBC's television network expanded from four stations, with the 1947 World Series boosting local television sales. By the early 1950s, NBC had achieved success in television, launching shows like Today, The Tonight Show, and Wide Wide World. NBC commissioned Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera for television, \"Amahl and the Night Visitors,\" which was a major hit.\n\nAlthough CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the U.S., their system was incompatible with black and white sets, leading to its abandonment.

By 1963, most of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, and the network began branding itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" NBC's commitment to color broadcasting led to the acquisition of the broadcast rights to the classic film \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1967, which had previously been a staple of CBS's color broadcasts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_8": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the late 1960s, NBC acquired the rights to broadcast \"The Wizard of Oz\" after CBS declined to pay the increased fee for renewal.

During the 2017-18 season, NBC saw further success with \"Ellen's Game of Games\" and the return of \"Will & Grace.\" The network also premiered several shows in the 2018-19 season, including \"The Titan Games,\" \"Manifest,\" \"Songland,\" and \"New Amsterdam,\" all of which were renewed for additional seasons. However, the network's dominance in the 2010s faded during the 2019-20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a disruption in production and leading to a move to the second position in the Nielsen ratings.
