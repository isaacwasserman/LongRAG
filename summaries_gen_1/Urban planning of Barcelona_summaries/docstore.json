The Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956 aimed to rationalize urban development, while the Regional Plan zoned areas for growth, infrastructure, facilities, and green spaces, like the Collserola mountain range park.\n\nDespite not being fully implemented, partial plans emerged, often catering to landowners' interests and increasing population density.

The city's water supply was upgraded, and natural gas was introduced, along with improvements to electrical and telephone networks.\n\nMajor events and projects included the 1952 International Eucharistic Congress, which led to the development of the Congreso neighborhood, and the opening of the first section of the Paseo Mar\u00edtimo in 1957.

The plan was divided into three main areas: small-scale urban rehabilitation, urban restructuring, and morphological reorganization. However, the plan faced numerous lawsuits and claims, leading to its dissolution in 1985. Despite this, its general guidelines have influenced urban planning actions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.\n\nThe concept of \"areas of new centrality\" was developed between 1983 and 1989 to promote various sectors of the urban periphery and regenerate low-quality urban fabrics.

The 1992 Olympics served as a catalyst for strategic urban planning and led to the development of the \"Barcelona model,\" an integrative urban reform project. The late 1990s saw a shift towards sustainable urban planning, with an emphasis on public spaces and community facilities. The use of bicycles as a more environmentally friendly means of transport was promoted, and the Bicing bicycle rental company was established in 2007.
