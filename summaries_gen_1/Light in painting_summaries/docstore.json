In particular, naturalism (or tenebrism) and classicism emerged in Italy, with the former focusing on the imitation of natural reality and chiaroscuro, and the latter having a more intellectual and idealized concept of reality. During the \"full baroque\" period, painting became more decorative, with a focus on optical effects and luxurious scenographies. Scientific studies on light significantly influenced its pictorial representation, with light being studied as a system of composition and used to articulate the painting. Natural light was used exclusively, even as a symbolic element, and the nocturne genre became popular, requiring the use of artificial light sources.

Shadows are integrated into the luminous space, and the painting serves as an organized structure for the circulation and diffusion of light.\n\nIn contrast, Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens had different approaches to light. Hals had a Caravaggist phase with a bright and diffuse luminosity, while Jordaens had a style characterized by bright and fantastic coloring with strong contrasts of light and shadow. Between 1625 and 1630, Jordaens deepened the luminous values of his images.\n\nGodfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou, used artificial candlelight in his works, influenced by Rembrandt.\n\nLandscape painting was a prominent genre in Holland during this century, with artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde specializing in capturing atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_31": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "During the 17th century, the Dutch developed a unique sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of light in landscape painting, led by artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde. These artists focused on capturing the subtle changes in light and color throughout the day and seasons.\n\nJacob van Ruysdael, in particular, was known for his expressive depictions of light and shadow, which he used to accentuate the drama of the scene. His assistant, Meindert Hobbema, was known for his contrasting chromatic choices and lively light effects.\n\nAelbert Cuyp, on the other hand, used a much lighter palette with a warmer and more golden light, influenced by Italian landscape painting. He was known for his atmospheric effects, attention to light reflections on objects, and the use of elongated shadows and backlit sun rays.\n\nIn addition to landscape painting, still life was also a prominent genre in Holland during this century. Willem Kalf was one of its best representatives, known for his still lifes with a precise attention to detail, combining luxury objects and foods to create a play of light and shadow.\n\nIn Italy, classicism emerged as a reaction against mannerism, with artists such as the Carracci brothers, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Guercino, and Giovanni Lanfranco. These artists sought to represent nature idealizedly, inspired by classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance art. They used light as a paramount factor in the composition of their paintings, with slight nuances depending on the artist.\n\nClaudio de Lorena, a baroque painter, was one of the best at representing light in his works, using it as a plastic factor to organize the composition and create space and time, as well as an aesthetic factor to highlight light as the main sensitive element and create a dream world of ideal perfection.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_32": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "During the 17th century, Claudio de Lorena, a Baroque painter from Lorraine, gained recognition for his exceptional use of light in landscape painting.

Lorena preferred natural environments and a limpid light of dawn or warm sunset, avoiding sensational effects such as moonlight or storms. His work influenced numerous artists, including Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, who was known for his profound study of pictorial illumination and realism in the representation of his scenes.

Vel\u00e1zquez created a space-light atmosphere, where light is evenly distributed throughout a continuous, undivided space, generating a dynamic effect that blurs contours and creates movement. He often alternated between light and shadow, creating a parallel layering of space.\n\nIn his early career, Vel\u00e1zquez was influenced by Caravaggio, using tenebrism before evolving towards a more diaphanous light, as seen in his Villa Medici paintings.

Numerous studies of light and shadow were conducted, such as those by Claude-Henri Watelet and Francesco Algarotti. Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes advised his students to paint the same landscape at different times of the day, especially at four distinctive moments: morning, noon, twilight, and night. Rococo painting, which emphasized decoration and ornamentation, also emerged during this period, with a special reference in France and painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, who preferred illuminated scenes in broad daylight or colorful sunrises and sunsets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_36": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "During the 18th century, several art movements emerged, including Rococo in France, which featured illuminated scenes in broad daylight or colorful sunrises and sunsets, as seen in the works of Jean-Antoine Watteau, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard. Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin excelled in still life, creating atmospheres and light effects with soft and warm light. Venetian vedutismo, led by Canaletto and Francesco Guardi, focused on urban views with precise details achieved through the use of the camera obscura. Landscape painting gained autonomy with the incorporation of the aesthetic concepts of the picturesque and the sublime, as seen in the works of Michel-Ange Houasse, Claude Joseph Vernet, and Hubert Robert. In England, landscape painting was highly valued, with artists such as Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne, and Thomas Gainsborough capturing the English landscape and its luminous and atmospheric effects.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Francisco de Goya evolved from a Rococo style to a personal form of preromanticism. Goya's work often used light metaphorically to represent reason and freedom, contrasted with darkness symbolizing ignorance and repression. He also had a fondness for nocturnal atmospheres and tenebrism.

Jacques-Louis David, a leading neoclassical painter, used light to create a clear, cold, and diffuse effect, emphasizing line and contour over color. His style influenced other neoclassical artists like Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson and Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, who focused on chromaticism and pure lines, respectively.\n\nLandscape painting, though considered minor by neoclassicals, had prominent figures, particularly in Germany, such as Joseph Anton Koch, Ferdinand Kobell, and Wilhelm von Kobell, who excelled in capturing atmospheric and light effects in their Alpine landscapes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_39": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the 19th century, art evolved rapidly, leading to the emergence of modern art in contrast to academic art. Photography and advancements in artificial light, such as gaslight, kerosene, and electricity, brought about a new understanding of light's role in visual perception. Romanticism, the first style of the century, emphasized spirituality, fantasy, sentiment, love of nature, and the artist's emotions.\n\nPierre-Paul Prud'hon was a French artist who combined neoclassicism with a rococo influence, focusing on feminine voluptuousness and using dim, twilight, and lunar light in his mythological paintings. Landscape painting, considered minor by neoclassicals, had prominent figures in Germany, such as Joseph Anton Koch, Ferdinand Kobell, and Wilhelm von Kobell. Koch's Alpine landscapes captured cloudy atmospheres and natural light, while Ferdinand Kobell's realistic landscapes featured intense contrasts and translucent light. Wilhelm von Kobell followed his father's style with a greater focus on light and hard, metallic figures.\n\nRomanticism, with its emphasis on emotion, spirituality, and nature, used expressive techniques and valued the figure of the \"genius.\" William Blake, a pre-Romantic artist, created nocturnal images with unreal, liquid light. Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli, another pre-Romantic, used strong contrasts and theatrical lighting in his dreamlike images. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, an early Romantic, used light symbolically in his masterpiece, \"The Raft of the Medusa.\" Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, a prominent Romantic painter, was influenced by Rubens, the Venetian school, and John Constable, and developed a proto-impressionist style during his travels to Morocco.

His notable works include \"The Cross on the Mountain\" (1808), \"Memorial Image for Johann Emanuel Bremer\" (1817), and \"Woman at Sunrise\" (1818-1820). Friedrich often used natural phenomena symbolically, such as dawn and dusk representing birth and death. Meanwhile, Norwegian artist Johan Christian Dahl followed Friedrich's style but with a greater focus on naturalistic light and atmospheric effects, particularly in the sky and clouds.

Kersting applied Friedrich's mysticism to interior scenes, illuminating them with soft lamp or candle light, giving a solemn and mysterious air. Runge developed his own color theory, distinguishing between opaque and transparent colors, which he used to highlight figures and create a psychological effect, emphasizing the mystical character of nature.\n\nThe Nazarene movement, active between 1810 and 1830, adopted a style inspired by Renaissance classicism with an emphasis on religious themes. Their style was characterized by diaphanous luminosity and a preponderance of drawing over color.\n\nIn Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Biedermeier style emerged, a more naturalistic tendency between romanticism and realism. Artists like Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller, Johann Erdmann Hummel, Carl Blechen, Carl Spitzweg, and Moritz von Schwind each had their unique approach to light, from stylizing elements to capturing subtle effects, creating resplendent clarity, and using light as a psychological element.\n\nIn Spain, Jenaro P\u00e9rez Villaamil became the first professor of landscape painting at the San Fernando Academy, influenced by English landscape painting, characterized by neat drawing, graceful line, and picturesque and archaeological perspective.\n\nIn Italy, the Posillipo School emerged, a group of anti-academic Neapolitan landscape painters who showed a new concern for light in the landscape, with a more truthful aspect, far from the classical canons, characterized by shimmering effects and solid drawing.\n\nChristen K\u00f8bke, a Danish artist, is known for his delicate light in landscapes, reminiscent of the Pointill\u00e9 of Vermeer or the luminosity of Gerrit Berckheyde.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_43": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the 1830s, the Posillipo School emerged in Italy, comprised of anti-academic Neapolitan landscape painters like Giacinto Gigante, Filippo Palizzi, and Domenico Morelli.

Realism replaced romanticism, with artists concentrating on reality and everyday life, including peasant scenes and industrial settings. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, a realist painter, specialized in light-focused peasant scenes, using wax or clay figurines for composition and dense brushwork. Gustave Courbet, the champion of realism, was influenced by Flemish, Dutch, and Venetian painting, and used dramatic light and large, meticulously worked surfaces.

The Macchiaioli, in particular, aimed to reduce painting to contrasts of light and brilliance, capturing the power of Mediterranean light. Similarly, the Pre-Raphaelites in Great Britain sought realism through detailed images, vivid colors, and general lighting, often conducting extensive research for their works. In contrast, academic art, also known as art pompier in France, adhered to classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance styles, focusing on careful drawing, formal balance, and realistic coloring.

Seurat, in particular, was concerned with chromatic contrast and the interaction between colors and their complementaries, and he developed a disc to help him mix colors in his mind before fixing them on the palette. Signac, a disciple of Seurat, had a freer and more spontaneous style, while Italian neo-impressionists, known as divisionisti, applied this technique to scenes of greater social commitment.

Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner and captured atmospheric effects in his works. Heade was devoted to country landscapes with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism, focusing on the landscape of his native Gloucester with a placid light that gives a sense of eternity. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea.

Light and shadow became integral parts of the image, creating a homogeneous whole. Artistic methods like photography, film, and video, as well as installation art (including light art), significantly influenced the art of this century.\n\nArtists began to experiment with various types of light, such as natural and artificial mixtures, control of the focal point, dense atmospheres, and shaded or transparent colors. This was an extension of the impressionists' sensorial experiences, which gained prominence in the new century.\n\nAmong the early 20th-century movements concerned with light and color was Fauvism (1904-1908), which focused on color experimentation. Fauvist painters, including Henri Matisse, used color in a subjective and personal way, attributing emotional and expressive values to it. They believed that colors should generate emotions, with light originating from the colors themselves, creating an intense and radiant luminosity through contrasting pigments.\n\nExpressionism (1905-1923) emerged as a reaction to impressionism, emphasizing personal and intuitive art.

Light played a significant role in the objective-optical path, as seen in Vasili Kandinski's abstract works, which were inspired by the way sunlight diluted forms and accentuated chromaticism in his paintings. Other artists like Mark Rothko also used light in their abstract works through tonal gradations and chiaroscuro games.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the New Objectivity movement emerged in Germany, which returned to realistic figuration but still incorporated avant-garde techniques such as Fauvist and expressionist coloring. In this movement, urban landscapes with artificial lights played a special role.\n\nSurrealism, which placed special emphasis on imagination, fantasy, and the world of dreams, also used light as a special object of research.

Surrealism also emphasized light, as seen in Dal\u00ed's and Magritte's works.\n\nIn the context of Spanish artists, Dal\u00ed and Mir\u00f3 used light differently in their art. Dal\u00ed's light was inspired by his native Empord\u00e0, characterized by a \"static, clear, shining, sharp, glittering\" quality. He used light to create surprising effects and continued to seek new pictorial effects throughout his career. Mir\u00f3, on the other hand, reflected a magical and telluric light in his works, rooted in the landscape of Tarragona. He used flat and dense colors, with objects and figures bathed in an unreal light, often in nocturnal environments.\n\nIn the United States, the Ashcan School and American realism or American Scene emerged, focusing on everyday reality and life in cities, including artificial lights. The Ashcan School, led by Robert Henri, featured cold tones and a dark palette, while American realism, represented by Edward Hopper, was concerned with the expressive power of light in urban images of anonymous and lonely characters. Hopper took inspiration from black and white cinema and had a special predilection for the light of Cape Cod. His scenes are notable for their unusual perspectives, strong chromaticism, and contrasts of light.\n\nSince the Second World War, art has undergone a rapid evolutionary dynamic, with various anti-material styles emphasizing the intellectual origin of art over its material realization, followed by a return to classical forms of art, accepting its material and aesthetic component.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_63": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "After World War II, art rapidly evolved with various anti-material styles emphasizing the intellectual origin of art, followed by a return to classical forms of art that accepted its material and aesthetic component.

Post-painterly abstraction, also known as \"New Abstraction,\" focused on geometrism, with an impersonal language, while Minimalism involved a process of dematerialization that led to conceptual art. Hyperrealism emerged around 1965, characterized by its superlative and exaggerated vision of reality, with great accuracy in details, and an almost photographic aspect.
