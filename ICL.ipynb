      "{'input': ' Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of Cádiz in Andalucía, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother\\'s family name was Castellón. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo\\'s abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Dirección General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucción nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo\\'s studies, his abilities in painting and drawing — in particular his mastery of perspective — drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine Fígaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Boletín de la Dirección General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing \"increasing sophistication\" and being of \"complexity and extraordinary quality\". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca\\'s appeal to Picardo was the older man\\'s lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the \\'\\'Manifiesto de la Alhambra\\'\\' of 1952, described as one of “the most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andalucía for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo\\'s work throughout his career. Its influence, particularly in his work on Paradores, can be clearly seen.. During the 1950s Picardo pursued his personal architectural ambitions, entering competitions and publishing plans and drawings of uncommissioned buildings. In 1951 in  company with his fellow architect Carlos de Miguel he designed a centre for the Cofradía de Pescadores (Fishermen\\'s Brotherhood) of Altea in the province of Alicante which attracted much attention but remained unbuilt.Picardo, working alone, designed a small hotel which could be built on the Costa del Sol in Andalucía. He described it as \"un modesto parador (a modest inn), resolved in a simple and attractive way\".In competition, Picardo entered plans and drawings of a preliminary draft for the Delegación de Hacienda de Gerona (Treasury Delegation in Gerona) but came second behind the Spanish architect Carlos Sobrini who had been a year behind Picardo at college. He also came second in a similar competition a year later with a design for the Delegación de Hacienda en Las Palmas (Treasury Delegation in Las Palmas), once again losing to Carlos Sobrini.In 1958 Picardo co-designed with his brother Carlos Picardo a six-storey edificio de viviendas (apartment building) near Madrid\\'s Plaza de Las Ventas, designed for middle-class families.In the early 1960s Picardo built some houses in the vernacular and historical Andalucían style on the Costa del Sol and in Jerez and, in contrast, a number of modernist apartment blocks for the construction company Urbis in Madrid. He also moved on to a series of building commissions for the Spanish Ministerio de Información y Turismo (Ministry of Information and Tourism) which laid the foundation for his notable work in the 1960s and 1970s on a large number of the state-owned luxury hotel network Paradores de Turismo de España.. Even early in his architectural career, Picardo was viewed as a supreme draughtsman, producing quick sketches, perspectives, views, details and innumerable plans of his projects in which his skills can be easily identified. Artist. As well as his work on modern buildings and on preservation and restoration projects through the 1950s, Picardo continued to receive commissions for decorative mural paintings, where he \"demonstrated his mastery in the use of colour and techniques such as watercolour and oil\". His works were seen in locations such as the new Hotel de Los Cisnes in Jerez, while in Madrid he embellished the Bar Jerez, the Hotel Plaza, the Residencia de Ingenieros del Instituto Nacional de Colonización (Engineers\\' residence of the National Institute of Colonization), the Exposición de Regiones Devastadas (Exposition of Devastated Regions), the Instituto de Óptica \"Daza de Valdés\" (Institute of Optics), the sales area of the Garaje Villamagna (Villamagna Garage) and in 1953 he completed extensive paintings at the Restaurante Commodore in Madrid where amongst other images he produced two large curved panoramic views, one of Madrid and one of Cádiz. Picardo was regarded as an \"outstanding\" muralist.At the same time his drawings of buildings and architectural details were published as illustrations in a best-selling textbook on monumental and historic Spanish architecture, Arquitectura Popular Española, by the restoration and conservation architect Leopoldo Torres Balbás. Picardo travelled around Spain with him, making a multitude of detailed drawings of vernacular architectural elements for Balbás\\' books.. Picardo\\'s published architectural drawings were highly regarded. They were described as \"magnificent\" by the leading Spanish restoration architect Luis Menéndez-Pidal y Álvarez.In 1959 Picardo was given an unusual commission: to design a pack of baraja de naipes (playing cards) for exclusive use as advertising material by the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces\\' types. It is dated to 1960.Around 1960 Picardo was rewarded by the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) for the many illustrations he had provided for the DGA\\'s Boletín since he was a student with the publication of a small book, Dibujos de José Luis Picardo (Drawings of José Luis Picardo). More than 60 drawings appear in the book, both illustrations and humorous cartoons, and the foreword compares Picardo\\'s work to illustrators such as the Romanian-American Saul Steinberg and in Britain Osbert Lancaster and Hugh Casson. The book is long out of print and virtually unknown in Spain, and not at all elsewhere, but is available second-hand. Paradores de Turismo. From the early 1960s to 1985 Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de España. He had for some time carried out minor work for the Ministerio de Información y Turismo which controlled the hotel network. For the purposes of tourism the Ministry and its forebears had for over 30 years rehabilitated rundown and sometimes ruined historic buildings such as castles and convents and converted them into luxury hotels in a style that went beyond ordinary hotel use. In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments\\' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required.. A wealth of Picardo\\'s drawings for his Paradores projects survive. There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird\\'s eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo\\'s work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbarán. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of Cáceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gramática, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa María de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Catálogo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de interés nacional histórico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an \"outstanding\" staircase, and to return them to their original Mudéjar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mudéjar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel\\'s kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist\\'s work became an identifying feature of Picardo\\'s work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Jaén: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Jaén in Andalucía. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hostería with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hostería, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafetería and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo\\'s Parador at Jaén was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador\\'s admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensación espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room\\'s steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hostería and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo\\'s extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building\\'s interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building\\'s medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. He featured hand-painted written ceramic tiles, produced by Juan Manuel Arroyo, to decorate and \\'sign\\' the building, to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.In an article about the Jaén Parador for an architectural magazine in 1967, Picardo rhapsodised about the mood and aura he had created for the building: \"Exterior, un conjunto de masas elementales rectangulares./Interior, techos con artesas, bóvedas y arcos, madera, barro y piedra. .../Ay del romancero!\" (Outside, a gathering of rectangular blocks./Inside, artesonado ceilings, vaults and arches, wood, clay and stone. .../Oh, the romance!)In the same article Picardo credited his \"maestros\" (masters): \"Torres-Balbás, Moya, Sota y Luis Santamaria. Ninguno de ells la ha vista. Qué dirán?\" (None of them has seen it. What will they say?). At Jaen, and at Guadalupe, finished at much the same time, Picardo established a style of architecture and interior design which found favour with his clients and their guests and which he was to pursue in most of his further work for Paradores, refining it where required and elsewhere repeating it faithfully. Parador de Arcos de la Frontera: Casa del Corregidor. The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera in the province of Cádiz in Andalucía is located in the centre of the old town, at the top of the cliffs that overhang the Rio Guadalete. Picardo first visited the triangular site in February 1964. He decided immediately that the façades of the buildings facing the Plaza de España and the castle should be preserved, while the rest of the site — the old municipal slaughterhouse and other public utility premises and houses — should be demolished, though seven 2.35 metre columns from a patio within one of the buildings should be preserved to be used in the new building.In the twelve months from February 1964 all the demolition work was carried out. Picardo started work in October that year. He encountered a problem with a 15 centimetres wide crack across the top of the cliff which had been caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  He surmounted it by constructing a patio rather than building on the fractured zone next to the cliff edge. This single deck was built as an independent structure separated from the main building, so that any future movement of the terrain would not effect the Parador itself.. Picardo\\'s design of the Parador was a copy of a typical Andalucían residence with an entrance hallway leading to a typical patio, open to the sky, with terracing supported by the seven reused columns (though one further column had to be made to copy the others so as to achieve the same number of columns on all four sides). There were further small secondary patios. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andalucían architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and Jáen, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects. He also used his typical ceramic tiles throughout the building, both for decoration and for explanatory texts.Picardo planned 18 guest rooms, but initially only 9 were built, some in the building facing the plaza, and the rest fronting the cliff-edge view. The latter benefitted from the same design of open wooden galleries Picardo had utilised at Jaén. The Parador opened to guests on 7 November 1966.Picardo returned to Arcos in 1974 to complete his original plan, building another floor on the part of the building overlooking the cliff, using the same design features, and increased the number of guest rooms to 18. The extension entered service in 1979. Hostería de Pedraza: Hostería Pintor Zuloaga. In 1965 Picardo was commissioned by Paradores to restore and rehabilitate the old Casa de la Inquisición (House of the Inquisition) in the small, historic village of Pedraza, 37 kilometres northeast of Segovia in  Castilla y León. It was to be a hostería - only a restaurant and a bar - without guest rooms.The three-storey property was mostly in ruins when Picardo surveyed it and was consequently not protected by conservation laws. He was therefore free to carry out his renovation as he saw fit, building on the medieval and rural ambience of the village. On the exterior he rearranged and improved the windows, preserved the surviving coat of arms above the front door, and at the rear added what was becoming his signature open wooden gallery on the top floor. Inside, Picardo followed the rustic style of the region\\'s inns, building a spacious lounge behind the entrance hall, with a large and low fireplace, and on the upper floors the bar and the 90-seat dining-room opening onto the balcony-gallery.Once again, Picardo designed his own furniture and other fittings, the lighting and decoration, following the local style.. The hostería - named \"Pintor Zuloaga\" - opened to the public on 14 December 1967.At the same time Picardo raised the idea of expanding the property by purchasing neighbouring buildings. He had been concerned that the Hostería had restricted views, and felt that an extension could be designed with extensive views of the Sierra de Guadarrama to the south. His plans offered the prospect of 16 guest rooms and in November 1969 the proposal to convert the Hostería into a Parador was made public. However, difficulties in purchasing the neighbouring property made the project impossible.The Pedraza Hostería continued in operation until 15 December 1992 when economic pressures on the Parador chain caused its closure. Parador de Alcañiz: La Concordia. In 1966 Picardo began the conversion into a Parador of the Palacio de los Comendadores at Alcañiz in the province of Teruel in Aragon. The palace - the façade of which was remodelled in late-Renaissance style in 1728 - stood as the most prominent additional part of the Castillo de los Calatravos (Castle of the Calatravos), a monastery-fortress built in 1179. The oldest parts of the structure, a keep, a church and a cloister, date to the 12th and 13th centuries.The section of the property set aside for Picardo\\'s conversion was the immense south wing, which was flanked by two towers and divided into three floors, the ground floor built of ashlar and the upper two floors of brick. There were balconies on the first floor, and on the uppermost floor a characteristic Aragonese long gallery had been developed, created by a succession of semi-circular arches. The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms. His plan for the public areas included the conversion of two large and long ground floor interiors, with pointed barrel-vaulted ceilings, on each side of the building\\'s entrance. To the left of the entry, in the original guardhouse, he placed the reception area and to the right, where the old stables were situated, he placed the bar and cafetería, adding one single window to each space to allow in some daylight. In these rooms Picardo left the exposed masonry of the walls and ceilings. The main dining room, which he placed on the first floor, connected by the main staircase from the ground floor, was based on the great hall of a palace. In it he featured a large fireplace and chimney at one end, and used a multitude of large timber beams to shape a coffered ceiling, with decorative plasterwork strung below.. The twelve guest rooms were arranged on the second floor, but the windows being high in the walls, Picardo arranged for a raised area in front of each window so that guests could see out of the windows with greater ease. The public corridors followed the design pioneered by Picardo at Jaén of imitation stone groin vaults at regular intervals.In planning the interior decoration Picardo determined that the ground floor would be medieval in design in keeping with the original military use of the palace, and the upper floors would be more palatial in decor. He designed much of the joinery, the beds, the tables, the chairs and, in particular, the light fittings, making use of the emblem of the Order of Calatrava as a decorative motif. His attention to detail even extended to the design of hinges and handles for doors, and for the heads of nails used in the door faces. He also made considerable use of his characteristic ceramic murals decorating the public parts of the building, including his history of the castle, all produced by his favoured ceramicist, Juan Manuel Arroyo, and signed by Picardo.The Parador opened for service on 18 May 1968 and was inaugurated on 6 July 1968.As early as 1972 Picardo had reported to the Ministry of Information and Tourism on the feasibility of carrying out further work to increase the number of rooms at Alcañiz. In 1975 he designed a new two-storey wing for the ruined west side of the complex which would double the number of guests rooms. His plans lay in abeyance until 1998 when the architect Carlos Fernández-Cuenca Gómez resurrected Picardo\\'s original 1975 designs. They had to be altered somewhat in the light of archeological discoveries made since 1975, but much of Picardo\\'s ideas were incorporated in the expansion of the Parador, bringing the number of guest rooms to 38. Hostería de Cáceres: El Comendador. In 1966 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alcúescar (Commander\\'s Palace of Alcúescar), also known as the Palacio de los Marqueses de Torre Orgaz, in the historic centre of Cáceres in the province of the same name in Extremadura. Originally built as a medieval fortified residence on pre-existing Arab buildings in 1488, the palace was modified in later centuries, adding Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The Ministry proposed the conversion of one part of the palace into a Hostería.The part of the building on which Picardo was to work was a jumble of old buildings, some attached to the main palace building and some free-standing, which had mostly formed stables and coach houses. There was also a patio-garden between these buildings and the palace and its tower.. Picardo began by demolishing most of the ramshackle service buildings, other than the square structure at Number 6 Calle Ancha which benefitted from substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. Picardo decided the lower ground floor of this building would form the bar and cafetería, with a doorway from the street which would become the main entrance to the Hostería. He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings. Picardo also installed a sgraffito image above the main doorway, featuring the cross of the Orden de Santiago (Order of Santiago).A new one-storey building was erected to the rear of the plot, imitating similar buildings in the city. Ashlar and solid brick formed the interior and exterior facings of the walls, and pantiles were utilised on the roofs. Picardo also excavated large areas beneath the buildings to make service areas. He designed and built a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden. Throughout, his intention was to make the Hostería appear, through imitation, to be an integral historic part of the old city centre.Internally, Picardo repeated many of his pastiche medievalisms as seen in his previous Parador projects, with much use of heavy timber, such as a dark coffered ceiling in the dining room and classic Castilian designs for windows, doors, furniture, and light fittings. Terracotta tiles were used for the floors in the bar, the dining room and the two lounges.The Hostería de Cáceres opened on 18 May 1971.Further work for Picardo included the complete re-roofing of the palace, which involved renewing the roof structure, because of what he described as \"a degree of imminent ruin due to its terrible wooden structure\", and an extension to the original dining room area by glassing-in the colonnaded portico facing the patio garden.. In 1970 Picardo had suggested to the Ministry that the rest of the palace could be converted into a full Parador, utilising the already converted Hostería. This proposal was not taken up at the time, and a Parador was opened elsewhere in the city.The Hostería was closed in June 1984 because it was not making a profit. At that point the rest of the palace was, as Picardo had recommended, restored and converted and, with his original Hostería, opened as a full Parador with 27 guest rooms on 10 October 1989. Picardo was not involved in this work.. Subsequent expansions into neighbouring buildings have turned the Parador into a much larger establishment. Picardo\\'s original entrance, bar and cafetería area now form a sumptuous suite, though the medieval aura of his interior decoration and furnishings for that part of the building has been lost through modernisation. Parador de Carmona: Alcazar del Rey Don Pedro. In 1966, while building the Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, Picardo was commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near the city of Sevilla in the province of the same name in Andalucía with a view to constructing another Parador. After looking at the castle at Alcalá de Guadaíra, and the palaces of Écija, he came across the ruined castle of Carmona the Alcázar del Rey Don Pedro (also known as the Alcázar de Arriba y Puerta de Marchena). In his subsequent report to the Ministry of Information and Tourism Picardo was enthusiastic about Carmona and provided preliminary sketch designs, which the Ministry accepted, and in 1968 he began his preparatory work.The origin of the castle is probably Muslim and Pedro I restored it in the 14th century into a lavish palace in Mudéjar style. It was used by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain during their final battles with the Moors in Granada. The castle was abandoned after being severely damaged in a 1504 earthquake whose epicentre was near Carmona and ruined even further in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Seven towers remained, but most of the connecting walls of the fortress were in ruins.. Picardo chose the southeast of the vast castle area, a corner known as the Plaza de Armas (parade ground) to build the Parador. Situated at the highest point of the town, the views were judged to be spectacular, looking far over the plains.. Picardo also resolved to position the building on the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley and overlapping the foundations of the original castle walls by such an extent that there would be space for guest rooms within the sloping walls below the Parador\\'s ground floor. The 1504 earthquake and Picardo\\'s location of the building were to set up permanent problems for the Parador. In 1918 a survey of the area had revealed that the earthquake had opened a deep crack more than a metre wide in exactly the position where Picardo intended to locate the Parador\\'s southern wall. The result was that one part of the castle\\'s ancient wall, and the land behind it, had subsided by about 180 centimetres. As the crack and the subsidence had been concealed by rubble to a depth of about half a metre, and Picardo and his engineers were unaware of the results of previous surveys, it was not until work began in 1969 preparing for the new building that the potential instability of the ground was revealed.. The Service Geológico de Obras Públicas (the Public Works Geological Service) was brought in and located an underground fault of three to four metres. Despite that, the geologists considered the ground to be stable and decided that as long as certain protective measures to protect the foundations were taken the terrain would present sufficient resistant characteristics. Cement was injected to fill all the cavities and a reinforced concrete slab was constructed which, belatedly, allowed work on the Parador to continue.Picardo designed a typical Hispanic-Arabic layout with two central patios, one of which would be the centre of the public area, and the other the centre of the service department. The layout would effectively reproduce that of the original fortress. Even though it was an entirely new building, in keeping with his previous works for Paradores Picardo ensured it would be in vernacular form and would appear to be historic and as if elements of it had been there for centuries. The south and east walls of the building, which descended well below the parade ground level, would have four floors, and be sloping steeply outwards towards the ground below the cliff, allowing for the installation of rooms within them. Conversely, on the parade ground entrance side of the building there would be only two floors.Picardo\\'s first plan was that there would be 23 double guest rooms and 10 singles, together with the hospitality and service areas. The considerable delay in the start of building to allow the ground to be stabilised encouraged the Ministry to decide on a pre-completion expansion of the building, bringing the total guest capacity from 56 to 102. Most of the rooms would be on the southern façade with some below the Parador\\'s access level and others in what from the outside would appear to be the third and fourth floors, with those on the top floor, just beneath the roof, benefitting from Picardo\\'s now typical timber balconies.The main structure of the building, as was Picardo\\'s style, was formed of concrete, clad with ashlar and brickwork and enhanced by buttresses. The roof was formed of clay pantiles, topped with decorative chimneys of the same style as those Picardo designed for the Parador at Guadalupe, disguising guest bathroom ventilation outlets. Internally, he installed limestone columns and made much use of ceramic tiling, and brick. The floors were marble and terracotta.. As in previous Paradores built by Picardo he had control of the interior decoration down to the smallest detail, in Carmona achieving a Hispanic-Arabic ambience of a palatial Mudéjar style, with much use of coffered ceilings and star lattice-work in wood and stone and subtle changes of style in the progression from room to room. The public patio was adorned with semi-circular arches on tall, slender pillars, while the dining room was more robustly medieval in a gothic style with exposed wooden beams and pointed arches with finely cut stone hiding the structural ironwork of the roof. Lights and furniture, door fittings and mural tiles were all designed by Picardo.The Carmona Parador was inaugurated on 30 March 1976 by King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía.. In the year of the Parador\\'s inauguration a large crack was detected parallel to the south façade, affecting the entire building. To deal with this an expansion joint was constructed that divided the building into two zones. In 1977 Picardo reported that the building had moved in the direction of the valley. He calculated the lateral displacement as 4 centimetres at the expansion joint. There was a 45 degree crack in the Parador indicating a similar degree of slippage in the ground beneath the building. Picardo also indicated a number of smaller cracks in the building, but viewed them as of minor importance.The Service Geológico de Obras Públicas was brought onto the site again to monitor the building for a period. They found that there was continuing movement, and that this was more noticeable in the rainy season. They recommended that the foundations of the south wall be underpinned.Due to new government policy at the Ministry which required only employed personnel to work on Parador buildings, Picardo — as a freelance — could not be involved in the building\\'s structural problems after 1978.Despite underpinning in 1980, and in 1987 a tie beam being concreted in the ground at the foot of the south wall with anchors penetrating deep into the sandstone beneath the building, more movement was detected in 1996. In 2013 it was reported that further cracks had been detected in the area where the large cracks had first appeared in 1977. The building is considered to be seriously at risk in the event of a sharp rise in the water table, or another earthquake.Minor improvements and modernisations were carried out in the Parador in 1982 and 1983 under the supervision of the architect Jesús Valverde Viñas. In 1987 an expansion was carried out by the architect Carlos Fernández-Cuenca Gómez which included additional guest rooms, and a new pavilion for conventions. He rigidly copied Picardo\\'s style.. The Carmona Parador now has 9 double rooms, 51 twin rooms and 3 single rooms, making a total guest complement of 123. Parador de Sigüenza: Castillo de Sigüenza. In 1964 Picardo was involved, with the Ministry of Information and Tourism, in investigating old buildings for conversion into a new Parador in the Province of Guadalajara. Possible locations were the castle at Atienza and the Casa del Cordón, an old inn in the same town, the castle at Molina de Aragón and the castle at Sigüenza. He considered the last to be the best proposition despite it being comprehensively ruined. It stands prominently above the town and cathedral of Sigüenza and dominates the landscape. The Ministry set about acquiring it the same year. The Castillo de los Obispos de Sigüenza (the Castle of the Bishops of Sigüenza) was a palace-fortress with Iberian, Roman, Visigothic and Moorish origins. It was enlarged and modified repeatedly between the 14th and 18th centuries, after which it declined and deteriorated, suffering progressive damage during the French invasion, the Carlist Wars, and finally during the Spanish Civil War when it was bombed by artillery and from the air during the Battle of Guadalajara in 1937. It was then left in ruins for over three decades.Starting in October 1969 Picardo analysed the condition of the building. \"The state of the castle could not have been more pitiful\" he wrote years later. \"Its military nature had been spoiled by converting its towers into belfries; huge windows and balconies had been opened for living quarters, particularly in the southern part of the castle which had served as the living area for the bishops; all the walls had been covered with plaster and render which hid the original stone; and an endless number of parasitic features had been patched onto it.\" The structure was without roofs and there were numerous collapses along the entire fortified enclosure walls. In his report to the ministry, Picardo was blunt: \"La cobra de este Parador lava en sí la reconstrucción de todo el castillo, hoy en ruins.\" (The work on this Parador entails the reconstruction of the entire castle, now in ruins)In making his plans for the castle, Picardo resolved that it would be remodelled as totally medieval, without any concession to what remained of later additions, obliviating almost all of its later history. The castle\\'s real past was to be reinvented. Picardo later stated that \"the reconversion mainly consisted of re-creating the military feeling of the castle with its towers and battlements and of leaving as much wall-facing as possible in naked stone. The most delicate part was disguising or hiding the windows of the guest rooms and of other outside rooms which would have spoiled the massive impact a castle should have.\"   Work on converting the castle began in 1972. In pursuit of requiring the castle to appear entirely medieval, and as a fortress rather than as its later existence as a bishop\\'s palace, Picardo raised most of the outer walls by at least one more storey, causing the roofs to be flat rather than sloping and allowing for the hotel accommodation required. The towers, too, were further raised, including the twin towers of the fortified gateway, the barbican, which over the centuries had been restyled almost as belfries with sloping conical roofs.. In search of a military external image Picardo removed all the large windows, balconies and other wide openings which had been cut in the original outer walls of the castle, reducing what windows had to remain in the exterior (other than those of the dining room) to their minimum in size. The parts of the walls which had been destroyed by bombardment during the Civil War were rebuilt using the remaining stone detritus to match the surviving walls. The plaster and rendering with which the exterior walls were faced (in parts in sgraffito) was removed to reveal the original bare stone. Later buildings attached to the exterior of the building were demolished and any extraneous cladding was removed. All the surrounding walls and towers were crenellated.. Picardo cleared the central courtyard of all the post-medieval accretions. His criterion was what he termed \"unidid de estilo\" (unity of style): clearing the property of all non-medieval additions because he felt they distorted the castle\\'s \"guerrero\" (warrior) intensity. 40,000 tons of debris were removed from the courtyard.In his reconstruction of the interior of the castle Picardo exercised the standard practice of the Paradores network, and of which he was deemed to be the master, of using steel, reinforced concrete, blockwork and cement to erect the basic structure but hiding those modern elements behind a faked historical veneer of walls, beams, arches, and cladding made of stone, brick, timber and iron. Because the ingress of light to the interior of the building had been reduced by the minimising of the size of the exterior windows that remained, daylight had to reach the interior by making many window openings in the courtyard walls.. On the north wall of the courtyard and approached from the outside by the barbican towers, Picardo installed the main reception area and rebuilt a portico area with pillars and intermediate glass. Above were bedrooms with balconied terraces erected in his signature timber style. He repeated the historical rendering of the exterior facades of the castle which had been decorated with sgraffito, and which he had removed, by replicating the decoration on the northern walls of the courtyard.In the northeast corner of the ground floor had been the bishops\\' throne room, and Picardo here installed the main guest lounge, a lofty room with a timber-beamed ceiling and two large fireplaces and chimneys. On the east side of the ground floor was the dining room, with the building\\'s only large windows, which looked out onto the wooded ravine of the Arroyo Vadillo. The room used Picardo\\'s favoured powerful stone vaulting to hide the steel supporting structure of the floor above. On the courtyard side of the dining room he placed a similarly vaulted bar and café. Wide wooden staircases on this eastern side led to the first and second floor bedrooms, a few of which were in the northeast tower with windows looking over the town, and some towards the south, but most looking into the courtyard with those on the upper floor benefitting from Picardo\\'s typical  balconies. Another lounge with a wooden coffered ceiling was located on the first floor. Picardo took care to preserve one of the oldest rooms of the castle, the original chapel.. A further much smaller, three-storied pastiche monastic courtyard with semi-circular arches was built at the southern end of the castle which had sustained the most damage in the Civil War bombardment, with more guest rooms arranged around it. On the inner face of the west wall the original wine cellars, dungeons, granaries, bakeries and stables were removed and against this wall Picardo installed a 65 metres long banqueting hall with his familiar stone vaulting, and an attached bar room. Below this hall he installed large service areas.. Picardo, as  usual, provided his own interior decor, with special attention to the medieval. He designed classic Castilian-style furniture, flooring, rugs, doors, windows, light fittings, mirrors, heraldic displays, seigneurial crests, banners, explanatory mosaics and so on, everything down to the smallest detail. Picardo built 38 guest rooms and one suite on the first floor, and 42 rooms and one suite on the second floor, providing space for 162 guests. On the wall of the main entrance hall Picardo placed a mural consisting of 45 tiles making up a cartouche recounting, in his own words, the history of the Castillo de los Obispos de Sigüenza accompanied by a description of the physical work carried out in restoring the building. \"La actual construcción es casi toda nueva ...\" (The present building is almost all new ...) Picardo declaimed. He continued (translated into English): \"... the authentic parts being preserved, though reconstructed, the Romanesque chapel, the entrance and towers as well as the barbican, the two Renaissance doorways of the parade ground and the throne room. … The perimeter of the castle has been respected, the eastern façade being completely new and the other three reconstructed and remodelled. Wide gaps have been closed and additions have been demolished, trying to restore the medieval character of the exterior.\" He goes on to say the work was completed in 1976 and that he, Don José Luis Picardo, was the architect.The Parador opened to the public on 20 July 1976 and the first stage of building work was finished in November of that year. It was inaugurated by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía in April 1978. Sigüenza was to be Picardo\\'s last major project for the Paradores.. Remodelling and modernisation of the Parador took place in 1990 under the direction of the architect Carlos Fernández-Cuenca Gómez who scrupulously followed Picardo\\'s style. Despite these further works, the Parador has kept its original character as established by Picardo. Most of the improvements have been only to modernise the services and facilities. Other Parador projects. In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of Mérida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monzón, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Cataluña and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Cataluña.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Antón at A Coruña in 1968, the Posada del Cordón at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del Deán and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of Cáceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia. Also in 1971 Picardo inspected the castle at Molina de Aragón in the province of Guadalajara, and possibly also in 1971 the Castillo de Valderrobres in Teruel in Aragon. In 1972 he surveyed the castle at Trujillo in the Province of Cáceres in Extremadura, the cave houses of Mesón Gitano (now known as the yacimiento arqueológico Barrio Almohadí (archeological site Barrio Almohadí) and the nearby Alcazaba of Almería, and the castle-fortress at Aracena in the Province of Huelva in Andalucía. In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y León. Controversial legacy of Picardo\\'s Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo\\'s rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo\\'s work at Sigüenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr María José Rodríguez Pérez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects\\' objective as being escenografía convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached — Picardo\\'s Parador at Jäen is a good example — she has described them as being \"falso histórico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo\\'s defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art). Picardo himself maintained: \"El Arte es eterno ...\"(Art is eternal ...), \"...it is always current. The reconstructions of the castles are really false. If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo\\'s artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\" He goes on to say that faced with the dilemma of adopting a \"mimetic and conservative attitude or a more modern and disruptive approach\", Picardo claimed supremacy for Art. \"En Arte todo es posible\" (In Art everything is possible), wrote Picardo in 1994. \"A good architect will know how to weigh up both solutions and his sensitivity shall dictate his choice.\"Despite the current views of historians, Picardo\\'s Paradores — particularly those at Jäen, Carmona and Sigüenza — though pastiche, remain amongst the most popular of the network\\'s hotels. One United States travel writer enthused about Jäen: \"I love this parador, so dramatic in its setting, so theatrically conceived ... Inside, the deception is masterly, creating an ambience as old and austere as it is surrealistic and extravagant.\" Other historical restorations. Demonstrating his educated and precise knowledge of classical styles, during his career Picardo carried out restoration works on the Catedral de Cádiz, deleteriously affected by salt from being near the sea, the Real Monasterio de Santa María de Guadalupe, the Catedral de Santa María de Sigüenza, damaged during the Civil War, and in the tiny Ermita del Humilladero in the Sierra de Villuercas. He rehabilitated the Antiguo Palacio del Marqués de Montana (also known as Palacio Domecq) in Jerez, rebuilt the Palacio de Gamazo in Madrid which had been partially demolished three years before, restored the Castillo de San Felipe in Puerto de la Cruz de Tenerife and in his last project worked on the Archivo Histórico Provincial de Salamanca in the old centre of the city in 1995. Fundación Juan March. In 1970 Picardo was invited to compete with fellow notable architects Javier Carvajal Ferrer and Mariano García Benito for the contract to design and build a new headquarters building in the Salamanca neighbourhood of Madrid for the Fundación Juan March (Juan March Foundation) which promotes Spanish culture and science. He was asked to take part after Juan March himself was impressed by Picardo\\'s work at the Parador in Jaén. In 1971, Picardo, after seeking inspiration in the buildings of Greece and New York which he claimed provided \"two basic architectural references: the classic perfection of the Parthenon and the constructive audacity of the new languages of New York\", Picardo\\'s design won the competition and he was awarded the contract for the building.. Picardo designed a building of \"extreme simplicity and elegance, of great architectural beauty and modernity\".  Located between Calle de Castelló and Calle de Padilla, the building, started in 1972, consisted of seven floors at ground level and above, measuring 1,400 square metres in all, and four below ground, measuring 3,000 square metres. Picardo\\'s purpose in burying most of the building below ground was to obtain the maximum amount of free land for the garden. It was conceived as a cube with the same dimensions on each of the four façades and designed with continuous horizontal banding without break around the corners. The ribbon windows, formed of near-black anodised aluminium frames and dark coloured glass, alternated with bands of white Carrara marble cladding laid in a uniquely patterned bond. Black and white were to be the dominant colours, but Picardo, for reasons of time, was forced to accept an off-white marble mistakenly delivered for the façades rather than the pure white that was ordered.For the interior of the building Picardo designed several assembly halls, auditoria for concerts, theatre, cinema and conferences, along with numerous exhibition and gallery spaces, libraries, offices, Council rooms, conveniences and two floors of car parking below ground. The predominant materials used inside the building were white marble, bronze and walnut, with much carpeting and a wide staircase with fabric walls. The dominant colours were dark brown and beige.. In detail, Picardo set a large entrance hall and an exhibition space of more than 400 square metres on the ground floor, administration and the archive department on the first floor, a library with reading rooms and book storage on the second floor, and offices, meeting rooms and banqueting areas and reserve space on the remaining upper floors. Two of the basement floors were dedicated to car parking for about 100 cars and for services, while another basement floor housed two venues for events, conferences, concerts and theatre performances, one of them with 300 seats, the other with 100. A large hall connected the two performance spaces.Picardo integrated pictorial and sculptural works into the architecture itself and many pieces were produced by artists and sculptors specifically for the building. Among them were sculptures by Eduardo Chillida and Pablo Serrano and a mural by Joaquín Vaquero Turcios. Prominent amongst the artworks Picardo designed for his own building were the large bronze double doors in the south façade leading to the garden. The garden itself, of 1,700 square metres and also designed by Picardo, was intended from the original concept to be a notable part of the project.The building was inaugurated in January 1975 to acclaim. One observer has noted that in producing the building Picardo had been \"controlling proportions and spaces with complete ease and achieving one of the best buildings in the recent history of Madrid\". Picardo himself described it as his best work. Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Equestre. In 1978 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to build a public indoor riding arena for the Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Equestre (Royal Andalucían School of Equestrian Art) in Jerez de la Frontera, his birthplace. The school was established in 1973, dedicated to preserving the heritage of the Pura Raza Española (Pure Bred Spanish horse). It had few decent facilities until the interest and involvement in its activities of Prince Juan Carlos (later the King of Spain) and the Ministry\\'s subsequent decision to take charge of the school.. Picardo\\'s commission from the Ministry was to design a sala de equitación, a huge arena for horse and riding displays, in particular the school\\'s signature performance \"Como Bailan los Caballos Andaluces\" (\"How the Andalusian Horses Dance\") which would seat up to 1,600 spectators. Connected to it were to be stable facilities for 60 horses.Picardo utilised a neo-Renaissance style which in its colouring referred to Andalucía. Externally most of the structure was coloured in a deep ochre, representative of the land and soil of the region while the infilling of the façades copied the stark white of traditional Andalucían village homes. Rows of relief pillars were the perceived support for the immense crowning hip roof, with between them 54 large circular windows in a single row around the building. Above them, in the roof, Picardo positioned 36 dormer windows serving as ventilation. At ground level was another row of circular windows each placed within its own semi-circular arch and pseudo-supporting pillars.. Internally, the display area is rectangular with spectator seating on six tiers around the arena. Picardo repeated the external colouring inside the hall, with the ochre of the loose sand on which the horses perform, and bright white walls and pitched ceiling reflecting daylight from the many windows. At one end of the arena is the royal box and at the other the grand entrance, beneath flags, which leads to the stables and a central octagonal two-level tack room. Five stable blocks radiate out from the tack room, each with twelve boxes. Within the stables, Picardo repeated his images from the outside, with rows of semi-circular arches topping simple stone pillars.. The Sal de Equitación was opened for performances in 1980. Guernica in the Museo Nacional del Prado. When Pablo Picasso\\'s large 1937 anti-war painting Guernica was brought to Spain in 1981 from its then home in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, it was decided to hang it permanently in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, as Picasso had requested. Picardo and fellow architect José García María de Paredes, jointly heading a technical team, were commissioned to design a means of displaying the painting securely in the Salón de Luca Giordano in the Museum\\'s annexe, the Casón del Buen Retiro.The painting had to be protected by armoured glass from bombs, bullets, and vandalism. The architects\\' problem was that, while the painting is 7.76 metres long by 3.49 metres high, the largest sheet of 18mm triple armoured glass available at that time was smaller, at 7.50 metres by 2.45 metres. The decision was therefore made to install the painting some distance away from the main sheet of glass, so that the metal frame of the glass would not infringe on the view of the image. The solution for the display was to build an armoured glass and steel polyhedron case whose bevels, for full security, would meet the floor, the walls and the ceiling around the picture. The main glass itself was set at 10 degrees to the vertical to avoid reflections. The sources of illumination would be within the case. The size of the room in which the picture was displayed — a large high space originally created as a ballroom — allowed the whole canvas to be viewed from 25 metres away.Guernica was installed in September 1981 and the room opened to the public on 25 October that year, Picasso\\'s centenary. Within a year, over one million people had seen Guernica in its new Picardo/de Paredes setting. Opinions of the method of display differed. The artist\\'s daughter, Paloma Picasso, applauded the location and the method of display, as did Spanish artist Josep Renau. Catalan architect, Josep Lluís Sert, described it as \"magnificent\". The British art critic and collector, Douglas Cooper, wrote that the painting was \"admirably lit, there being no shadows, no reflections and no distortions.\" He went on: \"Never in its history has Guernica been displayed so beautifully or so entirely to its advantage.\" Others were not so convinced. It was reported that the fact the installation was built by the technicians of the Círculo de Bellas Artes rather than by the Prado\\'s own staff brought practical difficulties. And British art critic, David Sylvester, maintained years later that when Guernica was returned to Spain in 1981 \"it was hung in an annexe to the Prado, where by common consent it was not seen to advantage.\"In 1992 Guernica was controversially moved from the Museo Nacional del Prado (where Picasso had wanted the painting to be permanently displayed) to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. The Picardo/García de Paredes display installation is no longer in use. Election to the Real Academia. On 3 February 1997, at the age of 78, Picardo was elected Academician of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), being proposed by Julio Cano Lasso, Fernando Chueca Goitia and Luis García-Ochoa Ibáñez. He entered the Academy on 22 February 1998 with a speech entitled Hipólito, the composition and delivering of an address having been established as one of the requirements after being elected Academician. In it he talked of two of his passions: architecture and the horse. \"The horse is an animal that surpasses the human body in beauty, strength and speed,\" Picardo claimed. \"... and architecture, in turn, is the art that protects this human body and enables and exalts it.\" He confessed that it was impossible for him to decide between architectural beauty and equine beauty because both \"son perfecciones\" (are perfections).In 2000 Picardo gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores, an image of five policemen mounted on five horses in a compact group. The academy observes the complicated juego (game) of the twenty horses\\' legs of different colours and in different positions seemingly almost entwined.The academy also houses in its collection a portrait of Picardo by Luis García-Ochoa Ibáñez. Painted in 1953 it portrays Picardo in an informal pose at the age of 34. It was donated to the academy by his sons in 2023. Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura. In 2001 Picardo won the prestigious Premio Antonio Camuñas de Arquitectura (Antonio Camuñas Prize for Architecture). The prize has been awarded every two years since 1985. Its purpose is to recognise the oeuvre of a Spanish architect who has stood out in his or her work for architectural renovation. The prize jury praised Picardo, the ninth winner, as an architect \"knowledgeable about our culture ... who has quietly exercised his professional activity, reinterpreting and valuing the richness of our historical heritage.\" Personal life. Picardo married Trinidad de Ribera Talavera and they had five children: three boys and two girls.In a rare public description of Picardo\\'s personality a US travel journalist wrote of him in 1972 as \"a package of energy, wit and imagination ... eyes twinkling\".Picardo died on 27 July 2010 in Madrid.

      "{'input': ' Geography and location. Barcelona, capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant, on the Mediterranean coast. Its geographical location is between 41°16\\' and 41°30\\' north latitude and between 1°54\\' and 2°18\\' east longitude. With an area of 102.16 km², it is situated on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Collserola mountain range —with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point—, as well as by the deltas of the Besós and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the mountain of Montjuïc (184.8 m). Also, from the Collserola mountain range, several hills that follow a line parallel to the coastal range rise up on the plain: the hills of La Peira (133 m), La Rovira (261 m), El Carmel (267 m), Creueta del Coll (249 m), El Putget (181 m) and Monterols (121 m).The plain of Barcelona is not uniform, but has several undulations caused by the many torrents that once crossed the land, and also has a uniform slope from the sea to the Collserola mountain range, with an ascent of about 260 m. It is crossed by several faults, mainly the one that separates the Collserola mountain range from the hills that come forward in the plain, with a northeast-southwest orientation, and the one that separates the mountain of Montjuic from the coast. The terrain is formed by a substrate of slate and granitic formations, as well as clays and limestones. The coast was formerly occupied by tidal marshes and salt-water lagoons, which disappeared as the coastline advanced thanks to the sediments provided by the rivers and streams that flowed into the beach; it is estimated that since the sixth century BC, the coastline has been able to advance about 5 km. The area of the plain was formerly crossed by numerous torrents and streams, which were grouped into three fluvial sectors: Horta stream in the area near the Besòs river (or eastern area); the Blanca stream and the Gornal torrent in the Llobregat area (or western area); and, in the central area of the plain, a group of streams coming from the southern slope of Tibidabo, such as the San Gervasi, Vallcarca, Magòria and Collserola streams.The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters thanks to the protection that the orography of the terrain offers to the plain, which is sheltered from the north winds. The temperature usually ranges between 9.5 °C and 24.3 °C, on average. Rainfall is low, about 600 mm per year, and most of the precipitation occurs in spring and autumn. This scarcity meant that in the past numerous works had to be carried out to supply water to the city, including wells, canals and irrigation ditches. The vegetation of the area consists mainly of pines and evergreen oaks, and undergrowth of heather, laurestine, arbutus and climbing plants. In the past, both rainfed and irrigated agriculture was practiced —mainly vineyards and cereals—, although nowadays almost the entire surface area is built up.Barcelona, capital of the Barcelonès region and of the province of Barcelona, is the most important urban center in Catalonia in demographic, political, economic and cultural terms. It is the seat of the autonomous government and the Parliament of Catalonia, as well as the provincial deputation, the archbishopric and the IV Military Region, and has a port, an airport and an important network of railroads and roads. With a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015, it is the second most populous city in Spain after Madrid, and the eleventh most populous in the European Union. Administrative divisions. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km², 100 685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old core of the city, the one derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus the Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the eighteenth century. This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Being the oldest part of the city, it has numerous monuments and architectural works of interest, making it an important focus of tourist attraction. On the other hand, it houses the most important institutions of the city, such as the City Hall or the Generalitat de Catalunya.. Eixample (7.46 km², 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerdá Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerdà. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands.. Sants-Montjuïc (21.35 km², 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montjuïc mountain, which makes it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. It has a low population density, and its rate of population of foreign origin exceeds the average. It has a high percentage of green area, thanks mainly to the presence of the Montjuic mountain, as well as industrial land.. Les Corts (6.08 km², 81,200 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarrià, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval masia. It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-nineteenth century experienced a significant urban growth with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. The population is mainly autochthonous, and stands out for its high rate of young people. The majority is middle class, although the Pedralbes neighborhood stands out as one of the most exclusive in the city. Its main economic activity is in the tertiary sector, and it is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers.. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km², 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarrià and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Collserola mountain range. It is also the district with the lowest population density, mainly because it is a high status residential area, with a predominance of single-family houses. The economy is dominated by quality facilities, as well as private schools and health centers. Its population has the highest rate of higher education and technical and managerial professionals, as well as autochthonous residents, while the foreign population is dominated by the European Union.. Gràcia (4.19 km², 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gràcia, incorporated into the city in 1897. It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinardó (11.96 km², 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinardó district, formerly belonging to Sant Martí de Provençals, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. During the years of massive immigration, it was an area of strong real estate speculation.. Nou Barris (8.04 km², 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar. It is a peripheral area with a majority immigrant population, which also suffered from strong real estate speculation and even suffered from shantyism and self-construction, and which for a long time has suffered from a significant lack of assistance, infrastructure and basic services, which have been mitigated in recent times. The majority of the population is working class and has low purchasing power.. Sant Andreu (6.56 km², 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of Sant Andreu de Palomar, annexed in 1897. It was an agricultural and milling area until the mid-nineteenth century, when numerous industries began to settle. On the other hand, in the mid-twentieth century it received a strong wave of immigration, which was received in neighborhoods of cheap houses and residential estates, such as the Bon Pastor and Baró de Viver. In recent times it has experienced a certain revitalization thanks to commercial activities such as the location of the La Maquinista center or the urbanization of the surroundings of La Sagrera Station to accommodate the arrival of the AVE high-speed train.. Sant Martí (10.80 km², 232,629 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Sant Martí de Provençals, added in 1897. Like the previous one, it was an agricultural and milling area, until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution when numerous factories were installed in the area; however, in recent decades it has suffered a process of deindustrialization, replaced by economic activities more based on new technologies, especially after the location of the so-called 22@ district. This district also welcomed a large immigrant population. Thanks to the 1992 Olympic Games, it underwent a process of renovation of the entire waterfront, where the Olympic Village was located. Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Plaça del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts. The most notable were those of 1837, in which the city was divided into four districts (Lonja, San Pedro, Universidad and San Pablo); and that of 1878, after the demolition of the walls, in which 10 districts were established: I-La Barceloneta, II-Borne, III-Lonja, IV-Atarazanas, V-Hospital, VI-Audiencia, VII-Instituto, VIII-Universidad, IX-Hostafranchs and X-Concepción.Between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several neighboring municipalities were added to the city (Sants, Les Corts, Sant Gervasi de Cassoles, Gràcia, Sant Andreu de Palomar, Sant Martí de Provençals, Sant Joan d\\'Horta, Sarrià); a new administrative reorganization was then carried out, again with 10 districts: I-Barceloneta and Pueblo Nuevo, II-San Pedro, III-Lonja and Audiencia, IV-Concepción, V-Atarazanas and Hospital, VI-Universidad, VII-Sans, Las Corts and Hostafranchs, VIII-Gracia and San Gervasio, IX-Horta and Sant Andreu de Palomar, X-Sant Martí de Provençals.In 1933 a new reformulation was made, also with ten districts: I-Barceloneta, II-Poble Sec and Montjuïc, III-Sarrià, Vallvidrera and Sant Gervasi, IV- Sant Pere and Dreta de l\\'Eixample, V-Raval, VI-Esquerra de l\\'Eixample, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gràcia, IX-Horta, Sant Andreu del Palomar, Sagrera and Camp de l\\'Arpa, X-Sant Martí de Provençals, Clot and Poblenou. These districts were expanded in 1949 with two more: XI-Les Corts and XII-Sagrada Família.In 1984 the current division into ten districts was approved, established with the aim of decentralizing the City Council, transferring competencies to the new consistories. The new districts were established with maximum respect for their historical and morphological identity, but also seeking a practical and functional delimitation that would guarantee the residents a wide range of services. In general, an attempt was made to respect the old demarcations coming from the old city, its expansion and the aggregated municipalities, although some areas varied with respect to their historical belonging: Pedralbes, previously belonging to Sarrià, passed to Les Corts; Vallcarca, before Horta, was incorporated to Gràcia; El Guinardó, originally from Sant Martí, was added to Horta; and the new district of Nou Barris was segregated from Sant Andreu.The last reform was carried out in 2006, this time aimed at establishing the neighborhoods that make up each district, with the objective of improving the distribution of facilities and proximity services. Seventy-three neighborhoods were established, stipulated according to historical, cultural and social criteria, although the decision was not without controversy, mainly due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods defended as units by the neighborhood associations: thus, for example, from the neighborhood of El Clot was segregated El Camp de l\\'Arpa; from Sants was segregated the neighborhood of Badal; Esquerra de l\\'Eixample was divided between La Nova and L\\'Antiga Esquerra de l\\'Eixample; and Poblenou was fragmented into five neighborhoods. Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvorí. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Plaça de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port\\'s draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerdá in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Plaça de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Besós river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city —currently the Plaça Nova—.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire. This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core —what is now the Gothic Quarter— and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century —and probably by Count Miró— of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Besòs rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Besòs canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Calçats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea. The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km². The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l\\'Àngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montjuïc; those of Martorell and Castellví de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Eramprunyà (Gavà) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Besòs river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10–12 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent —later City Hall— or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital —such as the Santa Creu— or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the Bòria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Plaça Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop\\'s orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Lluís Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara —in the current Citadel Park—, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marquès del l\\'Argentera. Currently only the Portal de Santa Madrona, in the Drassanes, is still preserved.With the extension of the wall, a long avenue known as La Rambla, occupied mainly by religious institutions, was left within the city walls. It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Llàtzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc. Early Modern Age. In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers\\' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry. The city was still confined within its walls —the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta— despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona\\'s capital status meant that large-scale projects were not carried out. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Plaça de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Plaça de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montjuïc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area. In this period there was a notable demographic increase, and the economy was progressively industrialized, until it led to the so-called Industrial Revolution.. The arrival of the Bourbons generated a series of military engineering works, such as the castle of Montjuïc and the fortress of the Citadel. For the construction of the Citadel (1715-1751), 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood were demolished, leaving 4500 people homeless and without compensation, and the Rec Comtal was diverted. The work of Jorge Próspero de Verboom, it was a pentagonal walled bastion, with a protective moat and an esplanade of 120 m between the walls and the surrounding buildings. Demolished in the Revolution of 1868, on its perimeter was installed the park of the Citadel.There were also two new military roads that crossed the plain of Barcelona: the Mataró road —coincident with the current Pere IV street— and the Creu Coberta road, which connected with the Madrid road —current streets of Hostafrancs and Sants—.In 1753, the construction of the neighborhood of La Barceloneta began at the initiative of the Marquis of La Mina. Located on a small peninsula of land reclaimed from the sea, its layout was designed by the engineer Pedro Martín Cermeño, with a grid of orthogonal streets and blocks of houses of elongated plan, which is a clear example of academic baroque urbanism. In this neighborhood was located in 1772 the Clock Tower, the first lighthouse of the city; it was followed by the Llobregat in 1845 and Montjuïc in 1925.In 1771, the Edicto de obreria was approved, a municipal ordinance aimed at controlling private works in the city, which involved the regulation of the alignment of houses according to the layout of the streets, as well as the supervision of aspects such as the paving of the streets, the sewage system, the numbering of houses, etc. This edict established for the first time the obligation to request a building permit, accompanied by a report and the payment of the respective fees. Likewise, in 1797 a height limit was established for all buildings. During this century there was a change in the typology of private buildings, which went from the \"artisan house\" of the medieval type to the \"multi-family house\" with a collective staircase, which definitively separated work from residence.. Between 1776 and 1778 the redevelopment of La Rambla was carried out, an ancient torrent that during the Middle Ages marked the western boundary of the city, which had been populated since the 16th century, mainly by theaters and convents. At this time the inner wall was demolished, the buildings were realigned and a new landscaped promenade, in the style of the French boulevard, was designed. The paseos of Sant Joan and Gràcia were also planned, although they were not built until the turn of the century for the former and 1820-1827 for the latter. Likewise, the street of the Count of the Assault —currently New Street of La Rambla— (1778-1789) was laid out, named after Francisco González de Bassecourt, captain general of Catalonia, who had the initiative to create the street. In 1797 the Paseo Nuevo or Paseo de la Explanada was also created, located next to the military Citadel, a wide avenue lined with poplars and elms and decorated with ornamental fountains, which for a time was the main green space of the city, but disappeared in the urbanization works of the park of the Citadel.During the eighteenth century, the Born and Boqueria markets were established as the only two general supply markets, and in 1752 aspects such as weights and measures for the marketing of food products, in addition to coal, were regulated. 19th Century. In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked primarily to the textile industry, which in turn led to a Catalan cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, under a project called the Eixample, drawn up by Ildefons Cerdà in 1859. After the revolution of 1868, the Citadel was also demolished and the land transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.Although chintz printing was well established in Barcelona since the 18th century, the industrial era proper began with the founding in 1832 of the Bonaplata Factory, founded by Josep Bonaplata. In 1849 the complex La España Industrial, owned by the Muntadas brothers, was opened in Sants. The textile industry grew steadily until a crisis in 1861, caused by the shortage of cotton due to the American Civil War. The metallurgical industry was also gaining importance, boosted by the creation of the railroad and steam navigation. In 1836 the Nueva Vulcano foundry opened in La Barceloneta and, in 1841, La Barcelonesa began, one of the predecessors of La Maquinista Terrestre y Marítima (1855), one of the most important factories in the history of Barcelona.Industrialization brought about important changes in the urban planning of the city, due to the new needs of the economic sectors of the capitalist system, which required a strong concentration of labor and auxiliary services. Barcelona thus underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and a better articulation of the territory through a wide network of roads and railroads, which will lead Barcelona to become a colonizing metropolis of its territorial environment.. During this century, the municipal ordinances that began with the Edicto de obrería (Workmen\\'s Edict) were consolidated: in 1814, the Pregón de policía urbana (Proclamation of Urban Police) established in 84 articles all the provisions on civil building, maintenance of public spaces and various regulations on security and public order. In 1839, the Bando general de buen gobierno (General Good Governance Charter) renewed and expanded these provisions and, among other things, regulated the relationship between the width of streets and the height of buildings. On the other hand, the law of January 8, 1845 established the City Council\\'s own attributions in various aspects such as urban planning, regulating the sanitary conditions of public spaces, as well as the conditioning of streets, squares and markets. In 1856 the first Ordenanzas Municipales (Municipal Ordinances) were approved, which brought together and expanded previous provisions, within an urban code that contemplated for the first time all aspects of civic and institutional relations in the city. For the first time, building permits were required to include an interior layout plan. These ordinances soon became obsolete due to the new Eixample plan, until in 1891 new ones were drawn up that took into account the new specificities of the expansion and new links in the city. Among other things, the area of occupation of the plots was increased from 50% —established in the Cerdà Plan of 1859— to 70%.Among the main urban planning actions of these years were the opening of Calle de Fernando (Ferran) in 1827, between La Rambla and the Plaza de San Jaime (Sant Jaume), with a later continuation towards the Borne with the streets of Jaime I (Jaume I) (1849–53) and Princesa (1853). In 1833 the expansion of the Pla de Palau began, which was then the nerve center of the city, with the presence of the Royal Palace, the Llotja and the Aduana. The square was enlarged and the Portal de Mar was built (1844-1848), a monumental gateway to Barceloneta from the old quarter, the work of Josep Massanès, which was demolished in 1859 along with the city walls. Massanès was also the author of a widening plan in 1838 that was never completed, which included the triangle between Canaletes, Plaça de la Universitat and Plaça Urquinaona, and which already sketched what would become Plaça de Catalunya, located in the center of the triangle.. Another factor that favored the urban planning of these years was the confiscation of 1836, which left numerous plots of land that were built on or converted into public spaces, such as La Boqueria and Santa Catalina markets, the Gran Teatro del Liceo (Liceu) and two squares designed by Francesc Daniel Molina: the Plaça Reial and the Plaça del Duc de Medinaceli.Similarly, the new sanitary provisions enacted at this time led to the disappearance of numerous parish cemeteries, whose plots were developed as new public squares: thus, squares such as Santa Maria, del Pi, Sant Josep Oriol, Sant Felip Neri, Sant Just, Sant Pere and San Jaime (Sant Jaume) came into being. The latter became the political heart of the city, since the Barcelona City Council and the Generalitat de Catalunya were located there. On the other hand, the disappearance of the parish cemeteries led to the creation of a new cemetery located outside the city, the cemetery of the East or Pueblo Nuevo (Poblenou), based on a project of 1773 but which was built mainly between 1813 and 1819. It was followed in 1883 by the Southwest or Montjuic cemetery, while already in the 20th century, the North or Collserola cemetery was built (1969).In 1842, one of the clearest factors of modernity derived from new scientific advances, the gas lighting, began. The first illuminated streets were La Rambla, Fernando Street and the Plaza de San Jaime, specifically with gas produced by dry distillation of black coal (town gas). That year the Sociedad Catalana para el Alumbrado por Gas (Catalan Society for Gas Lighting) was created, renamed in 1912 as Catalana de Gas y Electricidad. In 1856, gas was successfully applied to domestic stoves and heaters.. One of the major factors in the dynamization of the city as the capital of a large metropolitan area was the arrival of the railroad: in 1848, the first railroad line in peninsular Spain left from Barcelona, connecting Barcelona with the town of Mataró. The stations of Francia (1854), Sants (1854) and Norte (1862) were then created. The Catalan capital became the center of a railway network in the shape of an 8 —the so-called \"Catalan eight\"— formed by two rings that intersected in the city. In the 1880s there were already links with France, Madrid, Zaragoza and Valencia, in addition to the rest of the Catalan provincial capitals. Two companies operated at that time: Ferrocarril del Norte and MZA (Madrid-Zaragoza-Alicante), integrated in 1941 in RENFE.The city\\'s first fire and police services also appeared at this time. In 1843 the Guardia Urbana de Barcelona was created, in charge of the defense of public safety; in 1938 they also assumed control of traffic and urban circulation. On the other hand, in 1849 the Sociedad de Socorro Mutuo contra Incendios (Mutual Fire Aid Society) emerged, a private company that in 1865 was replaced by the Sociedad de Extinción de Incendios y Salvamento de Barcelona (Barcelona \\'s Fire Extinguishing and Rescue Companyy), he first public fire department managed by the City Council. Its first chief was the architect Antoni Rovira i Trias, and its first firehouse was the Casa de Comunes Depósitos (House of Common Warehousess) which was followed by multiple firehouses throughout the city. In 1908, animal-drawn vehicles were replaced by motor vehicles, and in 1913 the figure of the firefighter, until then casual, was professionalized.. In the middle of the century, the Diputation of Barcelona took charge of establishing new road layouts in the Barcelona plain: the Sarrià road (now Sarrià Avenue), designed by Ildefons Cerdà and built between 1850 and 1853; the road from Sants to Les Corts (1865-1867); and the road from Sagrera to Horta (1871), now Garcilaso Street. In these years, the port, increasingly important as a source of raw materials —especially cotton and coal—, was improved with the construction of a new wharf and the dredging of the port by the engineer José Rafo, who presented his project in 1859.On the other hand, in 1855 the telegraph service began, with a network of radial character centered in Madrid, which from 1920 was extended peripherally with Valencia, Seville and A Coruña. Controlled by the State, the service was incorporated into the postal service, creating the Dirección General de Correos y Telégrafos (General Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs).It should also be noted that the first public parks appeared in the nineteenth century, as the increase in urban environments due to the phenomenon of the Industrial Revolution, often in conditions of environmental degradation, made it advisable to create large urban parks and gardens, which were paid for by the public authorities, thus giving rise to public gardening —until then preferably private— and landscape architecture. The first public garden in Barcelona was created in 1816: the General\\'s Garden, an initiative of Captain General Francisco Javier Castaños; it was located between the present Marqués de la Argentera avenue and the Citadel, in front of where today is the station of Francia, and had an area of 0.4 ha, until it disappeared in 1877 during the development of the park of the Citadel. At this time several gardens were installed on Passeig de Gràcia: in 1848 the Tívoli Gardens were created, between Valencia and Consell de Cent streets; and in 1853 the so-called Champs Elysées, with a garden, a lake with boats, a theater and an amusement park with roller coasters, were located between Aragon and Roussillon streets. These gardens disappeared a few years later with the urbanization of Passeig de Gràcia. Expansion of Barcelona (Eixample). In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir ¡Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerdà, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerdà Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliación, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Besòs, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Cerdà had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral·lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Glòries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat. It also foresaw the opening of three large avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular one that would connect the Citadel with Montjuic (avenida de la Catedral). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would circumvent the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universitat and Sant Pere.. Cerdá\\'s project was quite innovative for the time, especially with regard to the delimitation of green spaces and service areas, taking into account both functional, recreational and welfare aspects. The buildings were to have a height of 16 meters (first floor and four floors), and a depth of 10 to 20 meters. The distribution of the Eixample was to be in sectors of 20 x 20 blocks, divided into districts of 10 x 10 and neighborhoods of 5 x 5. Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park. It also had industrial and administrative facilities, and in the suburbs there was a slaughterhouse, a cemetery and three hospitals. However, most of these provisions did not come to fruition, due to the opposition of the City Council, annoyed by the imposition of Cerdà\\'s plan as opposed to Rovira\\'s, which had been approved in the competition, and also due to real estate speculation, which led to building the blocks on all sides and not only on the two sides planned by Cerdá.Cerdá accompanied his project with several memoirs and statistical studies in which he showed his urbanistic theory, developed in three main points: hygienism, based on his Monografía estadística de la clase obrera (Statistical monograph of the working class), where he criticizes the living conditions within the walled city in force until then —life expectancy was 38.3 years for the rich and 19.7 for the poor—, against which he proposes improvements in urban orientation according to factors such as climatology, as well as in the constructive elements; circulation, with a view to making public roads compatible between pedestrians and vehicular traffic, which led him to regulate the distribution of streets and to establish chamfers on all sides of the blocks to facilitate crossings; and the multipurpose design, with an urban layout that would be extrapolated both to spaces to be built and to those already existing, integrating the notions of \"widening\" and \"reform\", and that would give a hygienic and functional city, although this part of his project would not be carried out.It must be taken into account that in many cases the Cerdà plot was superimposed on suburban layouts already existing or under development, in addition to the fact that the towns bordering the city of Barcelona, which would be added in successive phases at the turn of the nineteenth century, had their own urban development projects. Among these layouts we must take into account the highways and rural roads, or the easements imposed by railroads, canals, irrigation ditches, torrents and other land features.. A tangential aspect of the new layout was the question of toponymy, since the new urban grid designed by Cerdá included a series of new streets for which there was no tradition when it came to naming them. The naming of the new streets was entrusted to the writer Víctor Balaguer, who was inspired by the history of Catalonia: Thus, many streets are named after territories linked to the Crown of Aragon, such as Valencia, Mallorca, Aragon, Provence, Roussillon, Naples, Corsica, Sicily or Sardinia; with institutions such as the Catalan Courts, the Generalitat or the Consell de Cent; with characters such as Jaime Balmes, Enrique Granados, Buenaventura Carlos Aribau, Ramón Muntaner, Rafael Casanova, Pau Claris, Roger de Flor, Antoni de Villarroel, Roger de Lauria, Ausiàs March or the Count of Urgel; or battles and historical events such as Bailén, Lepanto, El Bruch or Caspe.Projects of Expansion (Eixample) Interior renovations. The Cerdà Plan was developed mainly outside the city walls, due to real estate speculation, leaving aside the necessary improvements for the development of the old part of Barcelona. The need for a project of \"interior renovations\" was then raised, with the aim of modernizing the old core of the expanding city. One of the first was that of Miquel Garriga i Roca, author of a joint plan of alignments (1862), the first exhaustive plan of the city, at 1/250 scale. Garriga\\'s project foresaw the realignment of streets as the basic method of a broad renovation of the city\\'s interior, but the difficulty of its execution and the absence of expropriation mechanisms paralyzed this first project.. A more elaborate project was carried out by Àngel Baixeras in 1878, who presented an expropriation bill to the Senate, which was approved in 1879. Baixeras\\' project envisaged a thorough remodeling of the old city, and its most outstanding aspect was the opening of three major thoroughfares —initially called A, B and C— to make the old city center more walkable, following Cerdà\\'s old project. However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed Vía Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport. In 1860 an omnibus line had been opened along La Rambla, but the slowness of the carriages made this means of transport not very viable. In 1872, rails were laid for its traction, which lightened the transport, with imperial model cars —of English origin—, pulled by two or four horses. The line was extended from the port (Drassanes) to the village of Gracia, and later from the Drassanes to La Barceloneta. One of the first lines to operate was the English Barcelona Tramways Company Limited. In 1899 the streetcars were electrified.. During these years, street furniture also grew, especially since the appointment in 1871 of Antoni Rovira i Trias as head of Buildings and Ornamentation of the City Council, as well as his successor, Pere Falqués, who made a special effort to combine aesthetics and functionality for this type of urban adornments. The increase of elements such as lampposts, fountains, benches, kiosks, railings, planters, mailboxes and other public services was favored by the rise of the iron industry, which allowed their mass production and resulted in greater strength and durability.. In the 1880s the installation of electric lighting began, which gradually replaced the gas lighting on public roads. In 1882 the first street lamps were placed in the Plaça de Sant Jaume, and between 1887 and 1888 La Rambla and Passeig de Colom were electrified. However, the generalization of electric light did not take place until the beginning of the 20th century, with the invention of the light bulb, and it was not completed until 1929.Another service that emerged at the end of the century was the telephone. The first telephone communication in the whole peninsula took place in Barcelona, in 1877, between the Montjuic castle and the fortress of the Citadel —in the process of dismantling but still housing a garrison—. That same year the first interurban transmission between Barcelona and Girona was carried out by the company Dalmau i Fills, pioneer in the installation of lines in Barcelona. In 1884 the state monopoly of the service was established, but two years later the company Sociedad General de Teléfonos de Barcelona (General Telephone Society of Barcelona) was authorized to operate it, which was later absorbed by the Compañía Peninsular de Teléfonos (Peninsular Telephone Company). In 1925 the service was nationalized by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, and the Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España (National Telephone Company of Spain) was created. In 1897 there were 2479 telephones in the city, a figure that grew progressively: in 1917 there were about 10 .00, in 1930 26 .00, in 1960 200 .00, in 1985 750 .00 and in 2000 there were 850 .00 telephones.It should also be noted that in the last third of the century numerous supply markets were built, many of them made of iron, a fashionable element in the architecture of the time. The markets of Born (1872-1876), Sant Antoni (1872-1884), Hostafrancs (1881), La Barceloneta (1884), Concepción (1887-1888), Llibertat (1888-1893), Clot (1884-1889), Unió (1889), Gràcia (1892) and Sants (1898-1913) were built in this way. 1888 Universal Exposition. At the end of the century, an event was held that had a great economic, social, urban, artistic and cultural impact on the city: the Universal Exposition of 1888. It took place between April 8 and December 9, 1888, and was held in the park of the Citadel, a land formerly belonging to the Army and won for the city in 1868. The incentive of the fair events led to the improvement of the infrastructure of the entire city, which took a huge leap towards modernization and development.The remodeling project of the Citadel Park was commissioned to Josep Fontserè in 1872, who designed extensive gardens for the recreation of the citizens, and together with the green area he planned a central square and a ring road, as well as a monumental fountain and various ornamental elements, two lakes and a wooded area, as well as various auxiliary buildings and infrastructures, such as the Born market, a water reservoir —currently the library of the Pompeu Fabra University—, a slaughterhouse, an iron bridge over the railroad lines and several service sheds. He also designed the urbanization of the new sector of the Born, composed of a hundred plots of land, which would present a common stylistic stamp, although it was finally only partially realized.In addition to the Citadel, the Salón de San Juan (now Passeig de Lluís Companys), a long avenue 50 meters wide that served as the entrance to the Exposition, at the beginning of which was located the Arc de Triomf, designed by Josep Vilaseca, was remodeled. This promenade featured wrought iron balustrades, pavement mosaics and large lampposts, all designed by Pere Falqués. Most of the buildings and pavilions built for the Exposition disappeared after its completion, although the Castle of the Three Dragons and the Martorell Museum (both integral parts of the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona), the Orangery and the Umbraculum survived, while part of the park grounds were later occupied by the Barcelona Zoo.. Numerous works and improvements were carried out throughout the city for the event: the urbanization of the entire seafront of the city was completed, between the Citadel Park and the Rambles, through the remodeling of the Passeig de Colom and a new pier, the Fusta; the urbanization of the Plaça de Catalunya began, a process that would culminate in 1929 thanks to another Exposition, the International Exhibition of Electrical Industries; Riera d\\'en Malla was covered, giving rise to the Rambla de Catalunya; Avenue of Paral·lel was begun; and Passeig de Sant Joan was extended towards Gràcia and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes towards the west. The Golondrinas, pleasure boats that left in front of the statue of Columbus and offered a promenade to visitors, were also installed and still remain.. From the end of the century it is worth mentioning Pere Garcia Fària\\'s project to regulate the city\\'s sewage system (Proyecto de saneamiento del subsuelo de Barcelona: alcantarillado, drenaje, residuos urbanos, 1891). It was a project that placed special emphasis on hygienism, with innovative criteria that are still in force today: it established a visitable sewerage network, 80 cm wide by 170 cm high, maintained by a municipal brigade that still performs its functions. It is a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which works mainly by gravity —except for a few small pumping stations— making it necessary to have large collectors in the lower part of the city. Thanks to this project, the sewerage network was extended in a few years from 31.2 km to 212 km. Around this time, the streets also began to be urbanized with tiled sidewalks and cobblestone roadways, replaced in the 1960s by asphalt.It should also be noted that during the nineteenth century the increase in population and new industrial needs led to an increase in water consumption, which required a larger water collection and distribution network. Thus, at the end of the century a new pipeline was built from Dosrius (Maresme), with a 17 km gallery and a 37 km aqueduct that brought water to the city. The first marketing companies appeared then, the main one of which was the Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona (AGBAR), created in 1882.On the other hand, the increase in population between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the creation of new hospitals to serve the population of the new districts of the city: the Hospital Clínico y Provincial (1895-1906) and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (1902-1930), a monumental modernist-style complex designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. Later, the hospitals of Esperança (1924), the Red Cross (1924), the Military (1924) and the Hospital del Mar (1931) were created, while in 1955 the Hospital Universitari Vall d\\'Hebron, one of the main health referents of Catalonia, was inaugurated.During these years the Eixample was progressively urbanized, first thanks to private initiative and the so-called Sociedades de Fomento (Development societies), and from 1892 with the appearance of the Comisiones Especiales de Ensanche (Special Commissions for the Eixample) arising from the new Eixample Law of 1892. This law was based on the Law of Forced Expropriation of 1879, and developed a management system with public and private participation. The urbanization process used to have several phases: filling the area, parceling the land, installation of services such as sewerage, running water and lighting, and construction of buildings. Most houses used to be rented: the owner reserved the second floor (planta noble) and rented the others. 20th Century. The 20th century was conditioned by the convulsive political situation, with the end of the monarchy in 1931 and the arrival of the Second Republic, which ended with the Civil War and was replaced by Franco\\'s dictatorship, until the reestablishment of the monarchy and the arrival of democracy. Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530 000 inhabitants, in 1930 they had almost doubled (1 009 000 hab), to reach between 1970 and 1980 the maximum peak (1 754 900) and by the end of the century to 1 500 000 inhabitants.With the turn of the century, a new political scenario opened up, marked by the loss of the colonies in America and Asia and the rise of the Regionalist League, led by politicians such as Francesc Cambó, Enric Prat de la Riba and the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who expressed their desire to place Barcelona on the international front line, at the level of cities such as Paris, New York, Berlin or Vienna. It is the model of the \"Imperial Barcelona\" proposed by Prat de la Riba, or the \"Nova París del Migdia\" (New Paris of the Midday) commented by Puig i Cadafalch. In this sense, projects for the improvement of infrastructures, railroads, transport and equipment, the creation of a free port, the attention to the needs of an increasingly industrialized society, the search for mechanisms to accommodate the increase in population and to satisfy aspects hitherto little attended to, such as education, culture and green spaces, all arise in this sense. Municipal Aggregations and Plan of Connections. The beginning of the century was marked by the geographical expansion of the city: in 1897 Barcelona annexed six neighboring towns, until then independent: Sants, Les Corts, San Gervasio de Cassolas, Gràcia, Sant Andreu de Palomar and Sant Martí de Provençals. Likewise, in 1904, Sant Joan d\\'Horta was annexed; in 1921, Sarrià and Santa Creu d\\'Olorda (a small piece of land in Collserola segregated from Molins de Rei); in 1924, Collblanc and the Marina de Hospitalet, where the Zona Franca was created; and, in 1943, Bon Pastor and Baró de Viver, segregated from Santa Coloma de Gramenet. The city grew from 15.5 km² to 77.8 km², and from a population of 383,908 to 559,589.. The annexation of the new municipalities raised the need for a plan to connect the city, which was put out to public tender in 1903 (Concurso Internacional sobre anteproyectos de enlaces de la Zona de Ensanche de Barcelona y los pueblos agregados entre sí y con el resto del término municipal de Sarrià y Horta; \"International Competition on preliminary projects to connect to each other the Barcelona Eixample Area and the towns added and with the rest of the municipality of Sarrià and Horta\"), in which the French town planner Léon Jaussely was the winner. The integration of the new aggregated municipalities with Barcelona and between them was sought, with a predominance of the organizational aspects over the expansive ones, in an attempt to reformulate the Cerdà Plan, badly seen by the modernist generation. The Jaussely Plan was based on a structural scheme, with a differentiated treatment of the various urban fabrics, which recalls the Beaux-Arts type layouts in vogue in the international environments of the time. His proposal was based mainly on three criteria: a road scheme of main axes (five radial roads and two ring roads), the zoning of activities and the systematization of green spaces. The project envisaged large road infrastructures (boulevards, large squares, promenades, diagonals), parks and gardens, rail links —with underground interior lines—, public and collective buildings at the central points of the road layout, facilities and service areas. The project was only partially realized, and in 1917 it was reformulated with the so-called Romeu-Porcel Plan; however, the innovative nature of its ideas left a deep mark and inspired Barcelona\\'s urban planning for much of the century.. The most important action in these years was the opening of the Via Laietana, which connected the Eixample with the sea, projected with the letter A in the Plan Baixeras of 1878. The works were finally carried out in 1908, with joint financing between the City Council and the Banco Hispano Colonial (Hispanic Colonial Bank), the first concerted operation in Barcelona. The new road was designed with the desire to create an avenue with a uniform appearance, so most of the buildings are of noucentista appearance, with some influence of the Chicago School. Criticism of the works for the opening of this road, which involved numerous demolitions of houses —some buildings of artistic value were moved—, paralyzed the construction of the other two roads planned by Baixeras, although later some punctual interventions were made in these places, according to the projects of Antoni Darder (1918), Joaquim Vilaseca (1932, Plan de Reforma, urbanización y enlace entre los puntos singulares del Casco Antiguo; \"Renovation, urbanization and linkage plan between the singular points of the Old Town\") and Soteras-Bordoy (1956, Plan parcial de Ordenación del Casco Antiguo de Barcelona; \"Partial Plan for the Development of the Old Town of Barcelona\"). . Also in the early years of the century the slopes of Tibidabo were urbanized, with a wide avenue linking the avenue of San Gervasio with the mountain, which was occupied by single-family houses in the style of the English garden cities. For transportation, a tramway was installed on the avenue and a funicular to ascend to the top of the mountain (1901), where the Tibidabo Amusement Park was located. In 1906, the Vallvidrera funicular was also opened.An interesting urbanization project was that of the Can Muntaner estate (1900-1914), at the foot of Mount Carmel, in the neighborhood of La Salut, also designed as a garden city of single-family houses. The promoter was the industrialist Eusebi Güell, and the architect Antoni Gaudí was in charge of the layout. The project was unsuccessful, as only two plots were sold, and in 1926 the land was ceded to the City Council and converted into a park, known today as Park Güell.. During the first years of the century the port was enlarged, with a project elaborated by Julio Valdés and carried out between 1905 and 1912: the eastern dock was extended and a counter dock and the inner docks were built. These works gave the port practically its current physiognomy, except for the construction of the south dock and the inner dock in 1965.The turn of the century brought the general electrification of the city, both public and private. In 1911 the company Barcelona Traction Light and Power —better known as La Canadiense— was founded, which was committed to the use of the hydraulic resources of the Pyrenees, building reservoirs in Tremp (1915) and Camarassa (1920). It also built the Fígols and Sant Adrià de Besòs thermal power stations. Thanks to electrification, Barcelona began to stand out in sectors such as metallurgy, chemistry and automobiles, consolidating itself as an industrial and commercial center.During the first decade of the century, public urinals called vespasianas were installed, made of metal with a circular body with a capacity for six people, above which rose a hexagonal section for advertising, topped by a little dome. In the 1910s they were removed, and in the future it was established that all urinals had to be underground.[140]. During these years the tramway network was extended, thanks to companies such as Les Tramways de Barcelone Société Anonyme. The expansion of the city with the aggregation of the adjoining municipalities increasingly required a wide and fast transport network, whose progress was favored by the electrification of the streetcars, a fact that also lowered their cost and allowed the service to become more popular: from seven million passengers in 1900 it went to 17 million in 1914.At the beginning of the century the first buses also appeared: in 1906 the first line was created between Plaça de Catalunya and Plaça de Trilla, in Gràcia, operated by the company La Catalana, with five Brillié-Schneider cars. The service was suppressed in 1908 due to protests from the tramway companies, for which it was clear competition, but in 1916 some suburban lines appeared, running between Barcelona and Sant Just Desvern, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Hospitalet, Badalona, El Prat, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Gavà and Sant Climent de Llobregat. In 1922, city buses were reestablished, in charge of the Compañía General de Autobuses de Barcelona (General Bus Company of Barcelona, CGA), which was later absorbed by Tranvías de Barcelona, (Tramways of Barcelona) which went on to operate both transports.Also at this time the first taxis appeared: in 1910 the first 21 vehicles were licensed; in 1920 there were already a thousand taxis, with 64 stops throughout the city. In 1928 the green light was incorporated as a \"free\" signal, and in 1931 the color black and yellow was established as the city\\'s distinguishing color.. In the 1920s, urban transport was improved with the construction of the Barcelona Metro. Work began in 1920 with the installation of two lines: line 3 (Lesseps-Liceo), inaugurated in 1924, and line 1 (Cataluña-Bordeta), put into service in 1926. The network was progressively expanded, and today Barcelona has 12 lines. Initially it was operated by three companies: Gran Metropolitano de Barcelona (L3), Metropolitano Transversal (L1) and Ferrocarril de Sarrià a Barcelona (now Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya); the first two merged in 1957 into the company Ferrocarril Metropolitano de Barcelona, which together with the bus company Transportes de Barcelona formed in 1979 the company Transportes Metropolitanos de Barcelona (TMB).It should also be noted that during the first decades of the century, public schooling was greatly boosted, thanks above all to the initiative of the City Council, the Provincial Deputation and the Commonwealth of Catalonia. In 1922, the City Council created the Patronat Escolar, which promoted secular, bilingual education and pedagogical renovation, and promoted an ambitious plan of school buildings, including those built in noucentista style by Josep Goday (Ramon Llull, Collaso i Gil, Lluís Vives, Milà i Fontanals, Baixeras and Pere Vila schools). After the Civil War, public education was taken over by the central government, until the arrival of democracy, when the competences were transferred to the Generalitat.In these years, increasing importance was also given to the question of green spaces, which was raised in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, director of the Parks and Gardens Service of Barcelona: with the text El problema de los espacios libres (The problem of open spaces), presented at the XI Congreso Nacional de Arquitectos (XI National Congress of Architects), he proposed the placement of a series of green spaces in the form of concentric semicircles between the Besòs and Llobregat rivers, all along the Collserola mountain range, with small enclaves in the inner part of the city in the style of the London squares. He proposed four levels for the city: interior parks, among which would be the Citadel and Montjuïc, as well as three smaller ones (Letamendi, Sagrada Família and Glòries); suburban parks, among which would be the Hippodrome, Turó Park, Turó Gil, Font del Racó, Vallcarca, Guinardó and Park Güell; exterior parks (Llobregat, Pedralbes, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo, Sant Medir, Horta and Besòs); and the Collserola nature reserve. Rubió\\'s project was not executed, except in small portions, but little by little the city was gaining green land: from 1910 to 1924 it went from 72 ha to 450 ha. 1929 International Exposition. In 1929 the International Exposition was held in Montjuïc. For this event the entire area of the Plaça dEspanya, the avenue of Queen Maria Christina and the mountain of Montjuïc was urbanized, and the pavilions that currently house the Barcelona Fair were built. One of the main architects of the project was Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and it was one of the main test beds of noucentisme, the successor style to modernisme. The Exposition took place from May 19, 1929 to January 15, 1930, over an area of 116 ha, and cost 180 million pesetas.On the occasion of the Exposition, a large part of the Montjuic mountain was landscaped, with a project by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, who created an ensemble of marked Mediterranean character and classicist taste: the Laribal, Miramar and Greek Theater gardens were thus created.As in 1888, the 1929 Exposition had a great impact on the city\\'s urban development, not only in the area of Montjuïc, but also throughout the city: the squares of Tetuan, Urquinaona and Letamendi were landscaped; the Marina bridge was built; Plaça de Catalunya was urbanized; Diagonal was extended to the west and Gran Vía to the southwest, as well as the promenades of Gràcia and Sant Joan in the sections around Gràcia. Various public works were also carried out: street asphalting and sewerage were improved, public toilets were installed, and the replacement of gas lighting with electric lighting was completed.. Finally, the city\\'s communications were improved, with the construction in the 1920s of the Prat Airport, the renovation of the France Station, the improvement of connections with the suburbs, the elimination of level crossings within the city, the burying of the train tracks in the urban interior —in streets such as Aragó, Balmes and Via Augusta— and the electrification of public streetcars. A funicular railway was also built to reach the top of the mountain —with a second section to ascend to the castle which was replaced by a cable car in 1970—, as well as a cable car to access the mountain from the port of Barcelona, a work by Carles Buïgas that was inaugurated in 1931 due to a delay in the works.All these public works led to a strong demand for employment, causing a large increase in immigration to Barcelona from all parts of Spain. This increase in population led to the construction of several working-class neighborhoods of \"cheap houses\", such as the Eduardo Aunós group in Montjuic (now disappeared), the Ramon Albó group in Horta (now Can Peguera) and the Milans del Bosch (now Bon Pastor) and Baró de Viver groups in Besós. However, one of its worst effects was the rise of shantyism, since many of the immigrants who could not have access to housing resorted to self-construction, with precarious buildings made of scrap materials (cane, wood, brass), in single spaces for the family of about 25 m². In 1930 there were about 15,000 barracks in Barcelona, mainly in Sant Andreu, Montjuïc mountain and the beaches of Barceloneta and Poblenou, where neighborhoods such as Pequín, La Perona and Somorrostro are still remembered.In 1929, the first traffic lights were installed to regulate vehicular traffic: the first was located at the intersection of Balmes and Provenza streets, and by the end of the year there were ten operating throughout the city, regulated by agents of the Guardia Urbana. The Civil War meant a halt in the installation of traffic lights, which was reactivated in the 1950s. The first synchronization took place in 1958, in Via Laietana. In 1984 the Traffic Control Center was opened, which in 2004 controlled 1,500 traffic light crossings. Second Republic and the Macià Plan. The arrival of the Second Republic and the grant of self-government to Catalonia favored the creation of various urban development projects in a city that by 1930 had reached one million inhabitants and was deficient in infrastructure, housing, transport and facilities such as schools and hospitals. In 1932 the autonomous government of Catalonia, the Generalitat, commissioned the brothers Nicolau and Santiago Rubió i Tudurí to develop a zoning project for the Catalan territory (Regional Planning), which would be the first attempt at joint planning of all the lands of the Principality. The project included a region of Barcelona, which included the plain of the city, the Baix Llobregat and the group of towns around the Tibidabo mountain. The Regional Plan included all the considerations about the territory, both urban and natural, as well as in aspects such as agriculture and livestock, mining, industry, tourism, health and culture.Another territorial structuring project was carried out in 1936, the Territorial Division of Catalonia, based on a work commissioned by the Generalitat in 1932 to Pau Vila. The project sought a spatial organization based on administrative public services, which resulted in a division into 9 regions and 38 comarques. Barcelona became the capital of the Barcelonès comarca, which included Hospitalet de Llobregat, Badalona, Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs. At that time, Catalonia had an area of 32 049 km², 2 920 748 inhabitants and 1070 municipalities.. During these years an interesting urban planning project was generated, the Macià Plan (1932-1935), elaborated by the architects of GATCPAC, with Josep Lluís Sert at the head, in collaboration with the French rationalist architect Le Corbusier. The project envisaged a functional distribution of the city with a new geometric order, through large vertebral axes and with a new maritime façade defined by Cartesian skyscrapers, in addition to the improvement of facilities and services, the promotion of public housing and the creation of a large park and leisure center next to the Llobregat delta.. The Plan presented Barcelona as a political and administrative capital, with a working-class and functional character, which would be structured in different areas: a residential zone, a financial and industrial zone, a civic and service zone, and a recreational zone, which included parks and gardens and beaches; connectiobs, communications and transport were also studied in detail. The backbone would be the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, a 600 m wide strip that would run from the Llobregat to the Besòs. The Meridiana and Paral·lel avenues were also promoted, which would converge at the port, where a city or business center would be located, moving the port facilities to the Zona Franca. For the residential area, they proposed the creation of 400 x 400 m modules —equivalent to nine blocks of the Eixample— with large housing complexes and social facilities. The recreational area was conceived through green spaces located in these residential modules and in a large strip of land in the coastal area, between Barceloneta and Poblenou, as well as the creation of a vast complex for leisure called Ciutat de Repòs i Vacances (Rest and Vacation City), which would be located on the beaches of Viladecans, Gavà and Castelldefels.Although the Macià Plan was not put into practice, its innovative and avant-garde design made it one of the landmarks of Barcelona urban planning, along with the Cerdà and Jaussely plans. Some of its aspects inspired the city\\'s urban planning in the democratic period, especially in terms of the recovery of the seafront as a space intended for leisure, as evidenced by the location of the Maremagnum shopping center on the Quai d\\'Espanya or the creation of the Olympic Village and the various parks that follow one after the other from this to the Diagonal Mar area.Also on the initiative of GATCPAC, the Pla de Sanejament del Casc Antic (Old Town Sanitation Plan) (1935-1937), which provided for the demolition of blocks considered unhealthy, a sponging of urban space and the creation of hygienic facilities, all supported by a strong public intervention, a fact that favored the decree in 1937, in the course of the Civil War, the municipalization of urban property.The GATCPAC also developed a workers\\' housing plan inspired by Le Corbusier\\'s model of building à rédent, which was embodied in the Bloc house (1932-1936, Josep Lluís Sert, Josep Torres Clavé and Joan Baptista Subirana), an S-shaped housing complex of long, narrow blocks with a two-bay metal structure, with access to the dwellings through covered corridors. The outbreak of the Civil War cut short the dissemination of this project.In the 1930s the first pedestrian road signs appeared: the first ones were vertical, consisting of a white oval plate on a pole with the inscription \"pedestrian crossing\"; later, horizontal signs were placed, in the form of 10 x 30 cm metal plates, with a rough texture, placed on the asphalt in such a way that their protruding bands made cars slow down. Franco\\'s dictatorship and the Comarcal Plan. The years of the Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) were characterized by urban development, which consisted of the unbridled construction of cheap housing, mostly subsidized housing, to absorb immigration from the rest of Spain. In two decades it went from 1,280,179 inhabitants in 1950 to 1,745,142 in 1970. However, although subsidized housing was encouraged, this did not stop speculation. New housing was developed mostly on the periphery of the city —an area of about 2500 ha, twice the size of the Eixample—, with three main models: suburban sprawl neighborhoods, marginal or self-construction urbanization neighborhoods, and mass housing estates. The construction of housing was carried out, in many cases, without prior urban planning, and using cheap materials that, over the years, would cause various problems such as aluminosis. The construction fever caused the creation or expansion of new neighborhoods, such as El Carmel, Nou Barris, El Guinardó, Vall d\\'Hebron, La Sagrera, El Clot or El Poblenou. The growth of the suburbs caused the uninterrupted connection with the neighboring municipalities (Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Badalona, Sant Adrià de Besòs, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Esplugues de Llobregat), which in turn grew enormously, a fact that led Mayor Porcioles to coin the concept of the \"Great Barcelona.\"Real estate speculation was favored by the reform of the Municipal Ordinances carried out in 1942, which increased the height of buildings in relation to the width of the streets: in streets between 20 and 30 m (average width of the Eixample), heights of up to 24.40 m were allowed, equivalent to a first floor and six floors, while in streets over 30 m the height could reach 27.45 m (seven floors). This increase in buildability caused notable differences between buildings constructed at different times, and led to the presence of numerous party walls that disfigured the urban space, a problem that the city still suffers from despite several projects to remedy it, such as the Barcelona posa\\'t guapa (Barcelona, make yourself pretty) campaign.The post-war urban renewal was led by the head of urban planning of the new authorities, Pedro Bidagor, who in 1945 promoted the creation of the Barcelona Provincial Planning Commission, responsible for drawing up a planning project for the city and its surroundings. Thus arose the Regional Plan of 1953, developed by Josep Soteras, an attempt to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities in order to meet the strong demand for housing in the years of massive immigration, while trying to curb real estate speculation and improve the urban environment. The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. It also reserved large areas for infrastructure, facilities and green spaces; among the latter, it emphasized the enclosure of the Collserola mountain range as a large central metropolitan park.Although it was not carried out in its entirety, various \"partial plans\" emerged from its initial approach, most of which yielded to the pressures of the land owners and tended towards the requalification of land: a 1971 study calculated a 1.8 multiplication of the population density of the partial plans with respect to the Comarcal of 1953. The most relevant were those referring to the two ends of the Diagonal avenue, east and west: in the first the new neighborhoods of La Verneda and Besòs were created, while in the second the Zona Universitaria was projected and the neighborhoods of Les Corts and Collblanc were enlarged.. The growth of the population and the appearance of new neighborhoods implied the construction of new markets for the supply of basic products: Sagrada Família (1944), Carme (1950), Sagrera (1950), Horta (1951), Vallvidrera (1953), Estrella (1954), Guinardó (1954), Tres Torres (1958), Bon Pastor (1960), Montserrat (1960), Mercè (1961), Corts (1961), Guineueta (1965), Ciutat Meridiana (1966), Felip II (1966), Sant Martí (1966), Besòs (1968), Sant Gervasi (1968), Carmel (1969), Vall d\\'Hebrón (1969), Port (1973), Provençals (1974), Lesseps (1974), Trinitat (1977) and Canyelles (1987).During these years, automobile traffic increased considerably, which led to the improvement of the city\\'s road network: Meridiana Avenue was opened, the First Ring Road (Ronda del Mig) was built and the Second Ring Road was planned, the construction of subway parking lots was started and the freeway network was extended thanks to the 1962 arterial network project, with a set of radial highways starting from Barcelona in several axes (Vallès, Llobregat, Maresme). The opening of three tunnels to cross the Collserola mountain range, at Vallvidrera, Tibidabo and Horta, was also proposed, of which only the first one was built, of which only the first phase was built between 1969 and 1976 and the second between 1982 and 1991; the Rovira tunnel was also built between 1983 and 1987, linking El Guinardó with El Carmel, which was supposed to link the Horta tunnel with the center of the city.. In transportation, streetcars were replaced by buses, and the metro network was expanded; in 1941 trolleybuses appeared, which disappeared in 1968. The water supply was also improved with the contribution coming from the Ter River, natural gas was introduced, and the electrical and telephone networks were renewed.In 1952 Barcelona hosted the XXXV International Eucharistic Congress, which allowed the development of a new neighborhood known as Congreso (Congrés), with a housing complex designed by Josep Soteras, Carles Marquès and Antoni Pineda. The complex, of 16.5 ha, included a complex of 3,000 homes, 300 commercial premises, a church (parish of San Pío X) and various school, sports and cultural services and facilities, with alternating open and closed blocks. In the rest of the city, several renovations were also carried out, such as the opening of the avenues of Príncipe de Asturias (now Riera de Cassoles) and Infanta Carlota (now Josep Tarradellas); a monumental fountain was placed at the intersection of Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Passeig de Gràcia, the work of Josep Soteras; and Calvo Sotelo square —currently Francesc Macià— was landscaped, with a project by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí.In 1957 the first section of the Paseo Marítimo was opened, an idea that had emerged in the 1920s but had not yet been developed, with a project by Enric Giralt i Ortet. On the other hand, the housing deficit to accommodate the new immigration led to the enactment of the Social Urgency Plan of 1958, which led to the construction of large blocks of social housing in neighborhoods on the periphery, such as La Verneda, Torre Llobeta, La Trinitat and Verdum.. The Zona Franca, an industrial sector located between the mountain of Montjuic, the port and the Llobregat, was also established at that time. The idea arose in 1900, due to the loss of the colonial market in Cuba, promoted by Fomento del Trabajo Nacional (National Labor Development) an entity that commissioned the project to Guillem Graell. However, bureaucratic obstacles, the outline of several projects that did not come to fruition and the Civil War delayed its construction until the 1960s, although then simply as an industrial estate, abandoning the concept of a zona franca. In addition to the industrial area itself, several residential neighborhoods were located in the sector, such as Casa Antúnez, Can Clos, La Vinya and Polvorín. In 1967, Mercabarna, a central wholesale food market that supplies the entire city, was established in the area. In 1993 the Zona d\\'Actividades Logísticas (Logistics Activities Zone) (ZAL), dedicated to post-production and pre-commercial activities, was also created in the area.Between 1957 and 1973, Josep Maria de Porcioles was mayor, a long term of office known as the \"Porcioles era\", which stood out in urban planning for its speculative rampage, favored by the Municipal Charter of 1960, which granted the City Council broad powers in many areas, including urban planning. Porcioles created the Municipal Housing Board, whose developments included the creation of large housing estates, such as Montbau (1958-1961), Southwest Besòs (1959-1960) and Canyelles (1974). Some of the urban development actions of this period were positive, such as the covering of Aragón street, the extension of the Gran Vía towards the Maresme, the adaptation of the seafront of Montjuic or the Barceloneta promenade; however, the speculative rampage of large real estate operations generated popular discontent that resulted in the so-called \"urban social movements\", which combined the discomfort generated by the degradation of the urban periphery with political protest against the Franco regime. Examples of this were the opposition to the new layout of Lesseps square caused by the opening of the First Ring Road (Ronda del Mig), or the reaction against the Partial Plan of Vallbona, Torre Baró and Trinitat, organized by a neighborhood association called Nueve Barrios (Nine Neighbourhoods) which later gave rise to the name of that new district of the city.. Despite the rise of developmentalism, there were some attempts at urban reorganization, such as the Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1966), which sought to make profitability and urban construction compatible, although its guiding character did not lead to practical realization; and the so-called Plan Barcelona 2000 (1970), a somewhat utopian attempt to establish criteria for the future city, where the importance given to infrastructure predominates, while a realistic commitment was made to the disorderly nature of urban growth. In the same 1970 a project for a Universal Exposition in 1982 emerged, which foresaw the opening of large avenues in the city, among them a vertical axis that would link Plaza de España with Vallès through the Vallvidrera tunnel, and a Gran Vía Norte formed with Josep Tarradellas street and the Travessera de Gràcia extended to Santa Coloma; all this was not finally realized. In 1969 the Vilalta Plan for the construction of treatment plants for the treatment of the city\\'s wastewater was also approved.Between 1964 and 1972 the Plan de la Ribera was developed, aimed at the urbanization of the city\\'s eastern seafront, from Barceloneta to Besòs, an area of 225 ha. Prepared by Antoni Bonet i Castellana, it was based on the deindustrialization of the area, and proposed the creation of a megastructure of seven large blocks of 500 x 500 m of luxury housing. The project had a long administrative process, and was not included in the Regional Plan until 1970. However, in 1972 the Town Planning Department of the City Council requested a redrafting of the project, due to opposition from neighbors and professional associations, who denounced the speculation attempts of the companies that financed the project, so it was definitively paralyzed. However, over time the plan was recognized as an attempt to renew Barcelona\\'s urban planning, in line with international trends such as urban renewal or renovation urbaine, and the renovation of the coast remained in the collective imagination, which was finally carried out on the occasion of the Olympic Games.Finally, during the dictatorship the actions in green spaces focused more on the maintenance and restoration of existing areas than on the creation of new spaces. In 1940 Lluís Riudor, the initiator of landscaping in Catalonia, was put in charge of Parks and Gardens. His actions included the Austria Garden —located in the Park Güell enclosure—, the Monterols Park, the Cervantes Park, and various interventions in the Montjuïc mountain aimed at eliminating shantytowns, a project continued by his successor, Joaquim Casamor, with the creation of several thematic gardens, such as the Mossèn Costa i Llobera gardens, specialized in cacti and succulents, and the Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer gardens, dedicated to aquatic, bulbous and rhizomatous plants. His work also included the Mirador del Alcalde and Joan Maragall gardens on Montjuic, located around the Albéniz Palacete; and, in the rest of Barcelona, the Putget, Guineueta and Villa Amelia parks. Democracy and the General Metropolitan Plan. The end of the dictatorship and the advent of democracy brought a new era in the architectural and urban planning panorama of the city, which was increasingly immersed in international avant-garde trends. The new socialist councils of Narcís Serra (1979-1982) and Pasqual Maragall (1982-1997) were committed to urban planning and architecture as the city\\'s hallmarks, and initiated an extensive program of urban reforms that culminated with the 1992 Olympic Games. The new public commitment was reflected in the increase of facilities such as schools, parks and gardens, roads and urban spaces, and civic, cultural and sports centers.A large part of the municipal actions consisted of the acquisition of urban land, a fact favored by the relocation of factories and industrial complexes that moved out of the city. This policy was favored by the new consistory, which appointed Oriol Bohigas as Urban Planning delegate, which began a period of strong public investment in the city that led to a radical change in the urban physiognomy and a new projection of Barcelona at international level, which came to fruition with the Olympic Games.Municipal actions in those years focused on reconstruction versus expansion, on public versus private initiative. Against the vision of the city as a unitary entity, the concept of the sum of realities was opposed, prioritizing attention to local needs. It sought to palliate both quantitative and qualitative deficits, in which each intervention in public space served as an engine of urban regeneration, compensating the peripheries with a \"monumentalization\" of their environment.One of the factors driving urban change was industrial restructuring, promoted by the Plan for the reindustrialization of the center of Barcelona, which resulted in the creation of an Zona d\\'Urgent Reindustrialització (Urgent Reindustrialization Zone) (ZUR). The new industrial development was based on factors such as R&D, and on the commitment to new technologies.. The new urban planning was embodied in the General Metropolitan Urban Development Plan (1976), drafted by Joan Antoni Solans, an attempt to curb speculation and rehabilitate the most degraded urban spaces, placing special emphasis on social, welfare and cultural facilities. To this end, the Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona was created, which included the capital and 26 surrounding municipalities. Three general lines of action were outlined: one of small-scale urban rehabilitation, such as the opening of streets and squares, the creation of parks and gardens and the restoration of buildings and artistic monuments; another of urban restructuring, focused on aspects such as road reorganization (ring roads), new central areas and land requalification; and another of morphological reorganization, which took the form of the current administrative division of the city into ten districts (1984), most of which coincided with the former municipalities attached to Barcelona. One of the main tools for these interventions would be the Plans Especials de Reforma Interior (Special Plans of Interior Renovations) (PERI).However, the ambitious nature of the project, which reserved numerous areas for green spaces and intended to requalify others with a high population density, provoked countless lawsuits and claims, both from individuals and landowners, which delayed its execution and eventually left the project practically inoperative, a fact that was materialized with the dissolution of the Metropolitan Corporation in 1985 by the Generalitat de Catalunya. Even so, its general guidelines have marked the urban planning actions of the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century.Between 1983 and 1989 the concept of \"areas of new centrality\" was developed, in search of a more polycentric and better connected city. The aim was to decongest the center by promoting various sectors of the urban periphery, which should regenerate low-quality urban fabrics thanks to their intrinsic morphological qualities. Twelve areas were delimited: RENFE-Meridiana, Diagonal-Sarrià, Tarragona street, Cerdà square, Port Vell, Glòries square, Diagonal-Prim (future Fòrum area), Sant Andreu-Sagrera and four related to the Olympic Games: Montjuic, Diagonal-Zona Universitària, Vall d\\'Hebron and Carles I-Avinguda Icària (future Olympic Village).. During this period, numerous stretches of the city\\'s roads were improved, with wide and often landscaped avenues designed mainly for pedestrian traffic. Some examples are: Avinguda de Gaudí, Avinguda de Josep Tarradellas, Carrer Tarragona, the connection between the old Rambles and the Rambla de Catalunya, Passeig de Lluís Companys, Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, Via Júlia and Rambla de Prim. Numerous squares were also opened and refurbished, in many cases also landscaped, such as those of Salvador Allende, Baixa de Sant Pere, Sant Agustí Vell, la Mercè, Sóller and Robacols.Among the sectoral plans developed during these years it is worth mentioning: those of Ciutat Vella, especially in the Raval, Santa Caterina and Barceloneta; that of Carmel; that of Gràcia, where several squares were urbanized (Sol, Virreina, Trilla, Diamant and Raspall, 1982-1985); and those of Sarrià, Sant Andreu and Poblenou. Policies to promote affordable housing were also carried out, and in Eixample the recovery of the block courtyards as green areas or public services was sought.In 1988 the Pla Especial de Clavegueram de Barcelona (Special Sewerage Plan of Barcelona) (PECB) was approved, which remodeled the network of coastal sewers, eliminating practically half of the city\\'s flood areas, while promoting the construction of breakwaters, which allowed the recovery of the city\\'s beaches. The same purpose was served by the 1997 Pla Especial de Clavegueram de Barcelona (Special Sewerage Plan for Barcelona) (PECLAB), which boosted stormwater regulation reservoirs to prevent flooding.The arrival of democracy favored the creation of new green areas in the city. At this time gardening was closely linked to urban planning, with a concept that combined aesthetics with functionality, as well as recreational aspects, sports facilities and services for certain groups such as children or the elderly, as well as areas for dogs. Numerous parks were converted from former municipal facilities, such as the Joan Miró park, built between 1980 and 1982 on the site of the former central slaughterhouse of Barcelona; or in industrial areas (Espanya Industrial park, 1981-1985; Pegaso park, 1982-1986; Clot park, 1982-1986) or former railway facilities (Sant Martí park, 1985; Estació del Nord park, 1988). The Creueta del Coll park (1981-1987), a work of the Martorell-Bohigas-Mackay team, was also established on the site of an old quarry. 1992 Olympic Games. Another of Barcelona\\'s profound transformations came on the occasion of the 1992 Olympic Games. The event involved the remodeling of part of the mountain of Montjuïc, where the so-called Olympic Ring (1985-1992), designed by Carles Buxadé, Joan Margarit, Federico Correa and Alfons Milà, a large enclosure located between the Olympic Stadium Lluís Companys and the Plaça d\\'Europa, which houses several sports facilities including the Palau Sant Jordi, was located.To accommodate the athletes, a new neighborhood was built, the Poblenou Olympic Village (1985-1992), with a general layout of the Martorell-Bohigas-Mackay-Puigdomènech team. The planning of the Olympic Village was complex, and several aspects had to be adapted: the coastal railroad had to be buried; sewage treatment plants had to be built and the wastewater that had previously gone directly into the sea had to be channeled; a new port (Olympic Port) was built; new beaches were established and regenerated; and new road and transport axes were laid out, such as Avinguda d\\'Icària. Several facilities were also installed in the area, such as the Telephone Exchange (1989-1992, Jaume Bach and Gabriel Mora) and the Meteorology Center (1990-1992, Álvaro Siza). On the other hand, the construction of two large skyscrapers (Hotel Arts and Torre Mapfre) changed the physiognomy of Barcelona.. Another area of action was the Vall d\\'Hebron neighborhood, planned according to a project by Eduard Bru (1989-1991), which combined green areas with sports facilities. This area was the site of the Olympic Press Village (1989-1991), designed by Carlos Ferrater.The Olympic Games also led to the creation of new parks and gardens, such as the parks of Mirador del Migdia, Poblenou, Carles I and three designed by the firm Martorell-Bohigas-Mackay: the park of the Cascades, the Olympic Port and the park of Nova Icària.On the occasion of the Games, the Old port (Port Vell) was also remodeled, with a project by Jordi Henrich and Olga Tarrasó. The new space was dedicated to leisure, with the creation of the Maremagnum leisure center, connected to land by the Rambla de Mar, a pivoting bridge designed by Helio Piñón and Albert Viaplana. For the event a Coastal Plan was also instituted with a view to the regeneration of the city\\'s beaches, which had been quite eroded until then, and which were totally renovated and won for the enjoyment of the citizens. Beaches such as Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta, Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella and Nova Mar Bella were cleaned and filled with sand from the seabed, sewage treatment plants were built on the Besòs and Llobregat rivers and underwater reefs were placed to favor flora and fauna. On the other hand, the Llobregat River was diverted in its final stretch 2.5 km to the south, thus allowing the port to be extended in that direction.. Another urban planning action was in the Raval neighborhood, which was remodeled with a project by Jaume Artigues and Pere Cabrera, which consisted of the opening of the Rambla del Raval and the adequacy of the surroundings of the Plaça dels Àngels as a cultural center, where the Center of Contemporary Culture of Barcelona (1990-1993) and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona (1987-1996) were located.The Games also brought progress in the technological sector, with new infrastructures especially in the telecommunications sector: the Collserola (by Norman Foster) and Montjuïc (by Santiago Calatrava) communications towers were built, and 150 km of optical fiber cabling were installed in the city\\'s subsoil.It should also be noted that the road infrastructure of the city was significantly expanded for the Games, especially with the creation of the ring roads, arranged as a ring road around the entire urban perimeter. The general planning was carried out between 1989 and 1992 by Josep Acebillo, technical director of the Municipal Institute for Urban Development, and Alfred Morales, coordinator of transport and circulation of the Barcelona City Council. There are currently three ring roads: the Ronda de Dalt, the Ronda del Mig and the Ronda del Litoral; the first two ring roads circumvent Barcelona, while the Ronda del Mig (of the \"middle\") crosses the city and receives different names depending on the section (Passeig de la Zona Franca, Carrer de Badal, Rambla del Brasil, Gran Via de Carles III, Ronda del General Mitre, Travesera de Dalt and Ronda del Guinardó).. On the other hand, there was a campaign to restore facades and monuments and to adapt dividing walls, called Barcelona posa\\'t guapa (Barcelona make yourself pretty) (1986-1992), directed by Josep Emili Hernández-Cros, from the Heritage area of the City Council.The celebration of the Games was a challenge for the urban planning of the city, and was a platform for a determined strategic urban planning action, with a perfect harmony between social and economic agents, which led to a new projection of the city both nationally and internationally, and led to talk of a \"Barcelona model\" as an integrative project of urban reform that was exportable to other cities.The last years of the century were marked by the search for a more sustainable urban planning based on ecological criteria. This new awareness was reflected in the search for public spaces adapted to the environment and designed for the residents, with special emphasis on community facilities and services. These criteria were defined in particular at the Sustainable Barcelona Civic Forum, held in 1998. One of the main achievements during these years in the interests of sustainability has been the commitment to the bicycle as a more environmentally friendly means of transport: in 1993 the first bicycle path was installed on Avinguda Diagonal, on a 3 km stretch; since then the space allocated to bicycles has not stopped increasing, the use of which has also been favored by the creation in 2007 of a municipal bicycle rental company (Bicing), with several stopping points throughout the city.The turn of the century also saw an increase in multi-municipal projects, especially in terms of infrastructure and transport, such as the expansion of the port and the airport, the route of the AVE and the Plan for public transport, or the projects for the rehabilitation of the Llobregat and Besós deltas. The Pla Director d\\'Infraestructures (Infrastructure Master Plan) (PDI) marked the expansion and improvement of public transport, with a Metro network covering the entire metropolitan area, the reintroduction of the tramway at both ends of the Diagonal (Baix Llobregat and Besòs), and the improvement of the bus network. 21st Century. With the turn of the century, the city continued to focus on innovation and design as projects for the future, together with the use of new technologies and a commitment to environmental sustainability. In 2000, the Urban Strategies Advisory Council was created to assist the City Council in urban planning and strategic decision making for the city and its surroundings. Initially it was composed of Oriol Bohigas, Dominique Perrault, Richard Rogers, Ramon Folch, Jordi Nadal and Antoni Marí.One of the first urban development projects of the new millennium was the creation of the 22@ district, thanks to a modification of the General Metropolitan Plan in 2000. Its objective is the reformulation of the industrial land in the El Poblenou neighborhood, a traditionally industrial sector that fell into decline at the end of the 20th century due to the relocation of most companies to land outside the city. The preservation of the productive business fabric of the area was then promoted, focusing on companies dedicated to new technologies, in line with the private sector and the day-to-day activities of the area. The area of action is 115 ha, which made it one of the areas of greatest urban renewal in Europe at the beginning of the 21st century.. One of the most outstanding events of the new millennium was the celebration of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures, which led to new urban changes in the city: the entire Besòs area, until then populated by old disused factories, was recovered, the entire Poblenou neighborhood was regenerated and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood was built, while the city was provided with new parks and spaces for the leisure of the citizens. The site was designed by Elías Torres and José Antonio Martínez Lapeña, with a 16-hectare multipurpose esplanade culminating at one end with a large photovoltaic panel, which became one of the emblems of the event.The urban planning of the new millennium has reinforced the polynuclear grid structure promoted since the 1990s, which has favored the emergence of new urban centers such as the Fòrum, 22@ and La Sagrera. Currently the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes is being remodeled, an important road axis where the undergrounding of automobile traffic is planned and the recovery of the land for public use.. Communications have improved with the arrival of the high-speed train, which links the Catalan capital with Madrid and Paris; the Mediterranean Corridor, a strategic transport line between the peninsula and the European continent, is in the project. The port and El Prat airport have also been expanded, with the aim of making Barcelona the logistics hub of southern Europe. The metro network has been expanded, with the extension of several lines (3 and 5), and the creation of some new ones (9, 10 and 11), some of them fully automated. In 2012, an orthogonal rearrangement of the bus network was initiated, to create a bus rapid transit network. The construction of a fourth ring road is also planned to improve communications in the metropolitan area, as well as the connection between the Baix Llobregat and Besòs streetcars through Avinguda Diagonal.In recent years, numerous infrastructures have been installed in the city to facilitate pedestrian transit in high and inaccessible areas, mainly elevators and escalators. A clear example is the neighborhood of El Carmel, where in 2005 there was also a subsidence due to the extension works of line 5 of the subway, which caused the demolition of several buildings and the relocation of hundreds of neighbors. As a result, the Generalitat declared El Carmel as an Àrea Extraordinària de Rehabilitació Integral (Extraordinary Area of Integral Rehabilitation) (AERI), with a program of intervention and promotion of public works, rehabilitation of buildings and improvement of public facilities.In terms of green spaces, the most recent projects include: the Central Park of Nou Barris (1997-2007), by Carme Fiol and Andreu Arriola, which in 2007 received the International Urban Landscape Award architecture prize in Frankfurt (Germany); the Diagonal Mar Park (1999-2002), by Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue, a park of modern design where the presence of water stands out; and the Poblenou Center Park (2008), by Jean Nouvel, divided into various thematic spaces, with an avant-garde design. In 2016, the first large park for dogs was opened, a 700 m² space located in the Nou Barris district, which has a watering hole and play elements for pets.A new impetus for urban planning began in 2015 with the start of the drafting of the new Pla Director Urbanístic (Urban Master Plan) (PDU) for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, scheduled for approval in 2021. The PDU is intended to complement the 1976 General Metropolitan Plan in order to promote the urban and social transformation of the metropolitan area of the Catalan capital, made up of 36 municipalities and 3.5 million inhabitants. The objectives of the new plan include: classifying metropolitan land and establishing criteria for urbanization, establishing building regulations, defining areas for urban transformation and their sustainable development, preserving the environment, respecting forest and agricultural land, and guaranteeing proper mobility of people and transport. According to Ramon Torra, manager of the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, \"the PDU has two conceptual objectives: the definition of a metropolitan urban planning model that integrates the current diversity, is ecologically sustainable, economically efficient and socially cohesive; and the methods and tools necessary to carry it out.\"In September 2016, a pilot test was initiated for the adaptation of certain sets of city blocks as \"superblocks\", intermediate spaces between the block and the neighborhood, with restricted vehicle traffic to enhance pedestrian traffic, bicycle circulation and public transport, also gaining spaces for leisure and public facilities. The first test was carried out on a set of nine blocks in Poblenou, where vertical and horizontal signs were changed to mark the area. Traffic is prohibited in a straight line, so that vehicles can only turn at intersections, and is limited to 10 km/h. This leaves free the interior space between blocks, which will be used for public spaces, for which an ideas competition has been organized among architecture students.After this pilot test, a new phase of creating superblocks in the Eixample district began in 2020, with the aim of establishing 42 new green axes and squares within ten years, until 2030. The first axis of action would be Consell de Cent street, where the creation of four new agoras in Rocafort, Borrell, Enric Granados and Girona is planned. According to the forecast, one out of every three streets in the Eixample would give priority to pedestrianization and public and sustainable transport. In contrast to the pilot tests, this time it will be done by axes instead of blocks, with the subsequent creation of new plazas on intersecting axes. Private traffic will be restricted to residents, with a maximum speed of 10 km/h. A budget of 37.8 million euros is foreseen for these actions. Work is scheduled to start in 2022. These changes seek to comply with the objetivos de desarrollo sostenible (Sustainable Development Goals) (SDGs) promoted by the United Nations Organization.The COVID-19 pandemic that began in December 2019 worldwide led to various urban planning changes in the city, some temporary and others that became permanent. On March 14, 2020, the Spanish government decreed the entry into force of the state of alarm throughout the national territory, with the obligation of citizens to confine themselves to their homes except for essential services. To keep their distance in order to avoid contagion, numerous spaces were set aside for pedestrians to pass through, at the expense of the roadways for vehicular traffic. These areas were marked with colored paint according to their use: blue for bicycles and yellow for pedestrians, together with the use of temporary elements such as bollards and concrete blocks. In many of these spaces, areas were set up as terraces for bars and restaurants, so that customers could drink outdoors, a space more conducive to avoiding contagion. These measures, initially conceived with an ephemeral character, were defined by the councilor of Urbanism, Janet Sanz, as \"an example of tactical urbanism.\" Over time, many of these temporary changes became permanent, such as the spaces enabled for terraces of hospitality establishments, which were regulated in September 2021 by a new ordinance that established new criteria for permanent street furniture, specifically seven new platform models to integrate the elements of such establishments (tables, chairs, umbrellas) in the surrounding space.

      "{'input': ' Background. The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France\\'s pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France\\'s national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany. In an interview in March 2023, Macron said that \"when he began working there were 10 million French pensioners and now there were 17 million\". The New York Times add that in order \"[t]o keep the system financially viable without funneling more taxpayer money into it – something the government already does – Macron sought to gradually raise the legal age when workers can start collecting a pension by three months every year until it reaches 64 in 2030.\" Additionally, Macron has \"accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension \\u200crules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation\".As part of Macron\\'s pension reforms, the retirement age was to be raised to 64 or 65, from 62.  The pay-as-you-go system –  raising the retirement age would help to further finance, as life expectancy increases and more start work later – would have a surplus of €3.2bn in 2022, but the government\\'s pensions advisory board (COR) forecast that it would \"fall into structural deficits in coming decades unless new financing sources are found\". In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that \"without immediate action\" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would \"balance the deficit\" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would \"pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early\".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 – the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from.In his New Year\\'s Eve speech on 31 December 2022, he clarified that the reforms would be implemented by autumn 2023. In early January 2023 prior to consultation with unions, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne spoke on FranceInfo radio, stating that the government could \"show flexibility\" on the intention to raise the retirement age to 65, and were willing to explore \"other solutions\" that would enable the government to \"reach its target of balancing the pensions system by 2030\". She announced that the policy would be presented to cabinet on 23 January and debated in parliament in early February, with full details published on 10 January. Use of Article 49.3. Article 49.3 of the French Constitution allows governments to bypass the National Assembly and force through bills without a vote. However, invoking it triggers a proviso that allows for no-confidence motions to be filed in the government. Because each party tends to only vote for their own motions and against those of others, on only one occasion, in 1962, where the Article has been triggered, the government lost a subsequent no-confidence motion.On 14 March, The Guardian declared that Macron had two options – broker deals with Les Républicains or force the bill through using Article 49.3, \"a measure that avoids an Assemblée nationale vote [the government] risks losing\". They said that \"[m]inisters have said the government would not use the 49.3, widely condemned as undemocratic and which risks inflaming a volatile public mood\" and that \"[i]nstead, there has been a flurry of negotiations by ministers to guarantee a majority in the lower house\"; \"[u]nion leaders have said using the 49.3 would lead to a hardening of opposition and would escalate strikes\". On 16 March, it was said \"[m]inutes before MPs in the lower house were to vote, Macron was still holding a series of frantic meetings with senior political figures, and suddenly chose to use special powers instead of risking a vote, which he appeared poised to lose\". The decision to invoke was a \"surprise, last-minute decision\" by Macron, as \"he was not certain of the support of enough lawmakers\" to take the bill to a National Assembly vote.The Guardian explained that 49.3\\'s invoking \"illustrates Macron\\'s difficult position in parliament\", with his parliamentary party/grouping having lost its majority in the National Assembly following the 2022 legislative election. Motivations. The coordination of the strikes by all of France\\'s trade unions has been labelled a \"rare show of unity\", with transport and energy workers, teachers, dockers and public sector workers (such as museum staff) all having gone on strike. Trade unions \"say the reform will penalise low-income people in manual jobs who tend to start their careers early, forcing them to work longer than graduates, who are less affected by the changes.\"Polls have consistently shown that the measures are substantially unpopular, as well as the use of Article 49.3 to enact them without a parliamentary vote in the National Assembly. France 24 reported that a poll from a few days prior to the move suggested around \"eight out of ten people opposed legislating in this way, including a majority of voters who backed Macron in the first round of last year\\'s presidential election\". The American Prospect opined that earlier support from conservative members of the National Assembly for the reforms had faded away as a result of polling that showed the reforms were unpopular. The decision to invoke Article 49.3 was seen by those on the left as a \"a major defeat and a sign of weakness\" for the government, that would now be seen as \"being brutal and undemocratic\"; Antoine Bristielle, a representative of the Fondation Jean-Jaurès think tank, commented that using 49.3 is \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" that could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\". Le Journal du Dimanche reported that Macron\\'s approval ratings hit a low comparable to the Yellow Jackets protests. In a poll spanning 9 to 16 March, 70% of respondents were dissatisfied with him and only 28% were satisfied.It has been suggested that the reforms do not adequately tackle the disadvantage women are at within the workforce, who usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower in comparison, attributed to more part-time work and maternity leave. Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be \"a bit penalised by the reform\" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in \\'physically or mentally demanding\\' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to \"mollify opposition\", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter\" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law. At the other end of the scale, it has been reported that some are concerned about \"being forced to retire later because older adults who want to work but who lose their jobs often face age discrimination in the labor market\".. Those opposed to the reforms argue \"the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers\", and have \"disputed the need for urgency\", The New York Times saying they contest that \"Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy\". In addition, opponents opine that Macron has \"exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies\", and that \"the official body that monitors France\\'s pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits\", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, \"were hard to accurately predict\".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France\\'s political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him, having \"struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \\'president of the rich\\'\". He said that \"[t]hat\\'s why he has not only all the unions, but also a large part of public opinion against him\", as \"[b]y tying himself to the project, opposition to it is heightened, dramatized in a way.\"It has been criticized for having taken place during a cost-of-living crisis, which some have attributed to worsening the anger and protests over the policies. The Times said that some have \"questioned the political wisdom of going ahead with the reform at a time when the public mood has been soured by high inflation\", as €7.1 billion of the €17.7 billion that \"the reform was meant to have saved has been wiped out by modifications to its provisions\". Rioting. The protests gave way to instances of violence and rioting as demonstrators and police forces clashed in the streets. Anti-union degradations. In Chambéry, \"banners, sound systems, flags, and union tunics prepared for the 7 March demonstration went up in smoke\" when fire was set to three vehicles parked in front of the Union hall.  The methods used resembled those used in other degradations in the area in the preceding year, including a swastika and anti-vax slogans spray-painted on the regional health agency (ARS) offices. Black bloc. There were black bloc groups at the front of the demonstrations in Paris, Lyon, and Nantes on May 1. There were between 2000 and 3000 in Paris, 1000 in Lyon (among 2000 the Rhône prefecture identified as \"risky individuals\"), and large numbers were also present in Nantes. Looting. An unauthorized protest on 15 April attracted over 1000 people to downtown Rennes and permitted two men to make off with €25,000 worth of gold bars and coins from a gold seller\\'s shop. Pre-Article 49.3 invoking. 19 January. On 19 January, the Ministry of the Interior counted 1.12 million demonstrators, including 80,000 in Paris. Over 200 demonstrations were reported in the country.More than one million people took to the streets in Paris and other French towns as part of countrywide protests over proposals to raise the retirement age. Eight of the largest unions participated in the strike over pension reforms. The French Ministry of the Interior said that 80,000 demonstrators gathered in the streets in Paris, where small numbers threw bottles, rocks, and fireworks at riot police. Over 200 demonstrations were reported in the country. According to the unions, 2 million people took part in the demonstrations with 400,000 of them participating in the Paris demonstrations.Despite the demonstrations, Emmanuel Macron emphasized that the pension reforms would go forward. French unions declared that further strikes and protests would be held on 31 January in an effort to halt the government\\'s plans to raise the standard retirement age from 62 to 64. The new law would increase annual pension contributions, from 41 to 43 payments throughout the year. Some flights out of Orly Airport were canceled, while the Eurostar website reported the cancellation of many routes between Paris and London. Though \"a few delays\" were reported at Charles de Gaulle Airport, owing to striking air traffic controllers, no flights were canceled. 21 January. Another demonstration was organized in Paris on 21 January, supposedly long-planned by students and youth organisations.Demonstrations organized by different groups took place in other cities, like in Dinan, Limoges and Lyon. 31 January. Demonstrations were organized around the country with public transport, schools, and electricity production specifically targeted by the strikes. Public television broadcasters were also affected by the strikes, with news broadcasts cancelled and music played instead.According to the CGT union, 2.8 million people took part in the protests while the Ministry of Internal Affairs counted 1.272 million protesters. 7 February. On 7 February, a third day of national protests were held after being called by l\\'intersyndicale. According to the CGT, 400,000 people demonstrated in Paris, down 100,000 from the 31 of January. In total, over 2,000,000 strikers participated in demonstrations according to the CGT, while the police estimate that around 757,000 strikers participated in protests. 11 February. On 11 February, a fourth day of national protests was held. According to the CGT, over 2,500,000 protesters took part in demonstrations, a rise of 500,000 compared to 7 February, while the Ministry of the Interior claims that 963,000 protested, a rise of over 200,000 compared to 7 February. In Paris, over 500,000 people demonstrated against the reform according to the CGT, while 93,000 demonstrated according to the prefecture. The Intersyndicale called for recurring strikes starting on 7 March. 16 February. On 16 February, protesters joined fresh rallies and strikes. Unions said some 1.3 million people participated nationwide Thursday, the lowest figure since the protest movement started on January 19. The interior ministry put the national figure at 440,000, down from nearly a million on Saturday (11 Feb). On the day, 30 percent of flights from Paris\\'s Orly airport were cancelled. 7 March. In early March, trains around the country continued to be affected by strikes and protests. It is believed that 1.1 to 1.4 million people participated in over 260 protests across the country. As a part of the protest, union members blocked fuel deliveries from being made, with the intention of bringing the French economy to its knees. 11–12 March. On Saturday, 11 March, the seventh day of protests was held in response to the National Assembly and Senate debating the draft law, with a final vote expected that month. Macron twice declined meetings with unions that week. About 368,000 people protested, below the 800,000–1,000,000 expected. The following day, the Senate passed an initial vote by 195–112. 15 March. On 14 March, The Guardian reported that \"French unions have called for a show of force with a final day of strikes and protests in the run-up\" the vote on the reforms in the National Assembly, which would be the eighth day of national mobilisation sofar. Transport Minister Clément Beaune said \"there would be disruption to public transport and flights, but it was unlikely to be a \"Black Wednesday\"\", with \"not ... the same level of disruptions as with previous mobilisations\".200 protests were reported to have taken place across the country. There were conflicting numbers of the strength of the protests; the Interior Ministry reported 480,000 marched throughout the country, with 37,000 in Paris, while CGT counted 1.78m and 450,000 respectively. Figures from Le Monde dispute both these claims. Reportedly, French police expected 650,000–850,000 protesters nationwide, fewer than the largest protests the previous week, with preliminary figures demonstrating a lower strike turnout in the energy and transport sectors at midday compared to previous days.Among those who were on strike were train drivers, school teachers, dock workers, oil refinery workers, as well as garbage collectors continuing their now ten-day strike action.In the afternoon, protesters gathered at the Esplanade des Invalides, with \"loud music and huge union balloons\". Police had ordered that the build-up of rubbish to be \"cleared out along the march route\" after some \"used garbage to start fires or throw trash at police in recent demonstrations\". The marchers were \"accompanied by a heavy security force\" as they \"moved through the Left Bank along unencumbered streets\". Police reported that one group of protestors \"attacked a small business\", and that nine people were detained within three hours of the march beginning. The protestors\\' march ended at the Place d\\'Italie. Known as \"Greve 15 mars\", it was co-ordinated and organised by eight trade unions..

Use of Article 49.3 and aftermath. 16 March. Use of Article 49.3. Protests erupted after the announcement that the pension reforms would be enacted without a parliamentary vote, Borne invoking article 49:3 of the constitution to do so just \"minutes\" before the scheduled vote on the bill. Inside the National Assembly, opposition MPs on the left booed and jeered the announcement and sang the national anthem in order to prevent Borne from speaking, forcing the session to be briefly suspended before the announcement by Borne was made. Speaking to MPs who were booing her, Borne proclaimed that \"[w]e cannot gamble on the future of our pensions ... The reform is necessary.\"Marine Le Pen announced she would file a no-confidence motion in the government, describing the use of Article 49.3 as \"an extraordinary confession of weakness,\" \"a total failure for the government\", and that Borne should resign. Fabien Roussel of the French Communist Party, who also \"called on street protesters and trade unionists to keep mobilising\", stated that the left was ready to make the same motion; Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure \"accused Macron of deploying a \"permanent coup d\\'état\" to shove through the legislation\". The Week said that \"Macron and his government insist the reforms are needed to keep the pension system solvent and government borrowing acceptably low\".Politicians from across the political spectrum denounced the move. Conservative MPs, such as those from The Republicans, whom Macron has relied upon for support in votes in the National Assembly, \"rebuke[d] the government, warning that its move would radicalise opponents and undercut the law\\'s democratic legitimacy.\" The Times reported that Macron was thought to have \"hoped earlier on Thursday to hold – and win – a parliamentary vote but changed tack after learning that only 35 of the 64 Republican MPs would back the reform, leaving him short of a majority\", quoting Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt, who said that they \"did everything [to have a vote] right up to the last minute\". MoDem MPs, who are aligned with Macron\\'s Renaissance group, said the decision to force the bill through \"was a mistake\"; Erwan Balanant said \"he had left the parliament chamber \"in a state of shock\"\", while \"[o]ther centrist MPs said it was a waste and showed weakness\". Reaction by protesters. In the Place de la Concorde, thousands protested (figures are disputed between 2,000 protesters and 7,000). France 24 reported that it was a \"spontaneous and unplanned rally\", but Le Monde stated that it was \"organized by the union Solidaires and authorized by the administrative court\". La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon spoke to the crowd, declaring that Macron had gone \"over the heads of the will of the people.\" He also claimed the reform had \"no legitimacy – neither in parliament, nor in the street\". It is possible that many joined the rally in Paris after being turned away by police from the \"blockade of the Veolia warehouse in Aubervilliers\".. Later, a bonfire was lit, with police armed with shields and batons deploying tear gas in an attempt to clear the square at around 8pm.

Numerous makeshift barricades in Paris streets were set alight.The CGT announced further strikes and demonstrations for 23 March; its head, Philippe Martinez, said that the forcing through of the law \"shows contempt towards the people\", with unions describing the move by the government as \"a complete denial of democracy\". France 24 commented that \"unionists were also out in strength, hailing a moral victory even as they denounced Macron\\'s \"violation of democracy\"\".Protests took place in other cities, such as Rennes, Nantes, Lyon, Toulouse, and Marseille. In the latter, shop windows and bank fronts were smashed, for which \"radical leftist groups\" were partially blamed, with shops looted.

On Twitter, a clip of protesters gathered at the Place chanting \"we decapitated Louis XVI and we can start again, Macron\" went viral, with protesters also, more generally, calling for Macron to resign. Broadcaster BFMTV reported that police detained 61 people following the protests. The Times claimed that the protestors\\' \"ranks were swollen by members of the \\'black bloc\\' – young masked troublemakers out for a fight\".

Unions from SNCF, the national train operator, \"urged workers to continue another continuous strike\".A multi-party no-confidence motion was tabled in the National Assembly earlier in the day. Spearheaded by centrist group Liot, it was co-signed by NUPES, with a total of 91 MPs from five different parliamentary groups signing. Later in the day, National Rally filed a separate no-confidence motion, signed by 81 cross-party MPs; party leader Le Pen said the decision to push through the pension changes was \"a total failure for the government\".On RTL radio, Interior Minister \"warned against what he called the chaos of random, spontaneous street demonstrations\", describing \"[t]he opposition is legitimate, the protests are legitimate, but wreaking havoc is not, and \"denounced the fact that effigies of Macron, Borne and other ministers were burned at a protest in Dijon\" and that \"\"public buildings had been targeted\". Aurore Bergé, head of Renaissance in parliament, wrote to Darmanin \"asking him to ensure the protection of MPs who feared violence against them\", because \"she would not accept MPs living in \"fear of reprisals\"\". He replied, saying \"police would be vigilant against any violence directed towards lawmakers.\" 18 March. On 18 March, it was announced protests in Paris were banned on the Place de la Concorde, opposite parliament, as well at the Champs-Élysées.

Leader of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, said his party would not back the no-confidence motions, as he \"refuses to \\'add chaos to chaos\\'\"; consequently, it was expected that the motions would not pass, as the Republicans act as de-facto kingmakers in the National Assembly, neither Macron\\'s bloc or the other opposition parties combined numbering a majority. NUPES\\' Jean-Luc Mélenchon informed RTL that \"[f]or as long as the 64-year reform is on the table, we have to keep it up, but decried the use of violence, advising protesters to not \"make our struggle invisible with practices that would be turned against us, as \"Macron... is counting on people going too far, so as to profit from a situation of fear.\" The Times reported that, in response to Ciotti\\'s party refusing to support the motions, and that some Republican MPs may not follow their leader\\'s decision, National Rally president Jordan Bardella was attempting to \"persuade more to follow suit by promising his party will not put up candidates against them if the crisis does lead to an election\". 20 March.

The \"collaborative website\" Penurie.mon-essence.fr said that approximately 986 fuel stations were \"plagued by partial shortages\", with 739 out of fuel \"completely\". Olivier Gantois, executive chairman of UFIP, said \"[t]here will only be a shortage if people continue to rush to fill up\", and that \"[i]f customers panic, logistics will fail and we will be out of supply\"; Le Monde added such comments were \"in belief that shortages are the sole result of preemptive purchases on the part of consumers\".

A CGT statement read that \"[n]othing undermines the mobilisation of workers,\" and called for workers to \\'step up\\' industrial action and \"participate massively in rolling strikes and demonstrations.\" Nunez announced that an internal investigation would take place after footage of an officer punching a man walking backwards, causing him to fall to the ground, went viral on French social media.AP said that the protests that took place in cities across France were predominantly \"small\" and \"scattered\", with only some \"degenerating into violence\" late in the day.

Opponents of the reforms on the left and far-right have submitted requests for review; only once the Constitutional Council has approved the bill can it be formally signed into law, and it can \"reject articles within the measure if they aren\\'t in line with the constitution\", with those opposed saying the text \"as a whole should be rejected\"; Borne\\'s office added that the referral was to \"accelerate the process\".

Reuters reported on 21 March of the unease within the parties that Macron is aligned, or close, to, and that the President should not be \"continuing business as usual amid violent protests and rolling strikes that represent the most serious challenge to the centrist president\\'s authority since the \"Yellow Vest\" revolt\". Gilles Le Gendre, a senior Renaissance MP, said that \"the president, the government and the majority ... are all weakened\" and that \"it\\'s not because the law was adopted that we can do business as usual\". Also of Renaissance, Patrick Vignal \"bluntly urged the president to suspend the pension reform bill\" due to \"the anger it has triggered, and its deep unpopularity\".Reuters quoted Eurointelligence analysts, who said Macron has two choices: \"[p]retending that nothing major happened and letting the crisis wear itself out, or pursuing co-habitation with the willing in the assembly. Given Macron\\'s nature, we see him being more attracted to the first option. A risky bet.\"On 20 March, CNN reported that \"[a]uthorities in charge of civil air traffic asked airlines to cancel 20% of their flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Air France warned of flight cancellations in the upcoming days\".Police \"were sent in the early hours of Tuesday to unblock the oil terminal of Donges ... which had been occupied for a week by strikers. The Ministry of Energy Transition \"also announced the requisition of \"three employees per shift\" at an oil storage facility in Fos-sur-Mer\", due to \"worsening supply tensions\"; they clarified that \"[t]he requisition is valid for 48 hours as needed, starting March 21,\" and relates to \"personnel essential to the operation of the storage facility\"\".\"Hundreds\" of workers have blocked access to the gas depots in a town near Marseille, with strikes at multiple refineries across western and southern France, \"partially disrupt[ing]\" oil shipments.

Protestors attempted to block access to the site, some \"intermittently thr[owing] objects\" such as stones at police, which used tear gas to try to disperse the demonstrators.

In Paris, police Paris announced they had ordered rubbish collectors back to work to \"ensure a \\'minimum service\\'; this will cover 674 staff, with 206 garbage trucks resuming operation.The Guardian, in an article dated 21 March, detailed activity at a blockaded incineration plant in Ivry-sur-Seine, south of Paris. A \"crowd of students gathered to support the strikers\" at the depot, with only \"a slow dribble of very few rubbish trucks ... now passing each day\" there.

He called the reform not a \"luxury\" or a \"pleasure\", but a \"necessity\", and that he did not \"enjoy passing this reform\", and \"had a responsibility not to leave the issue alone despite its unpopularity\". Of the protests, he \"said protesters had a right to take to the streets and their anger had been taken into account, but it was not acceptable when they resorted to violence without any rules whatsoever\", and he insisted he had continued confidence in Prime Minister Borne, and regrets \"not succeeding in convincing people of the necessity of the reform\".The CGT and CFDT union heads responded; of the former, Philippe Martinez said that the interview was \"outlandish\", and \"had taken millions of protesters for fools in claiming his reforms were the only alternative\", and adding that \"[t]he best response we can give the president is to have millions of people on strike and in the streets tomorrow,\" while Laurent Berger of the latter accusing Macron of \"rewriting history and lying to hide his failure to secure a majority in parliament\", with specific regard to his comments unions had not offered an alternative to the bill. Berger was quoted as having \"scolded\" the president for \"for seeking to portray the pension dispute as a tussle \"between one responsible (man) and a group of irresponsibles\"\". Marine Le Pen said \"she would not play \"any part in putting out the fire\" as the president was the only one who had the keys to a political crisis he had himself created\", and, pointing out that the interview being broadcast during lunchtime news programmes mostly watched by pensioners – which Reuters stated was \"the only demographic that is not dead set against the reform\" – was an example of Macron\\'s \"disdain for workers\", and how \"[h]e insults all French people, in general, all those who ... are protesting\".Striking workers briefly blocked trains during a demonstration at  Nice and  Toulouse.Additionally, it was reported that 13% of petrol stations are undergoing fuel shortages due to oil refinery blockades, and that \"almost half the pumps in the Bouches-du-Rhône area of the south have run dry\".

BBC News said \"the vast majority\" of protests \"passed off without violence\", but in the afternoon, \"violent clashes\" were reported to have \"broken out in parts of Paris\", riot police having used tear gas as \\'black bloc\\' protesters were reported to have thrown fireworks, bottles and stones at police and set bins alight. Riot police were also observed using baton charges on the Grands Boulevards. At other times on the march, fires in the streets ignited some of the uncollected piles of rubbish, with some small fires \"visible from the junction of Rue Saint-Fiacre and Boulevard Poissonnière\".. Mid-afternoon, clashes between police and protesters in Paris had grown more intense. On the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, one BFMTV report said \"the atmosphere has changed completely\" and that \"[w]e didn\\'t expect it to get out of hand so quickly\". BFMTV also reported that there were at least 350–400 \\'black bloc\\' protesters, using \"big\" fireworks, and at point targeting a Strasbourg-St Denis McDonald\\'s restaurant. A reporter claimed that police are deploying tear gas to push back the crowds, but it was ineffective due to the large number of people attending the protest. The police estimated that there were 1,000 protestors engaged in violence.By 5pm local time, demonstrators in Paris had converged on the Place de l\\'Opéra. Firecrackers and bins set alight around Avenue de l\\'Opéra were reported. At around 5:20pm, it was reported that that police on motorbikes had arrived in the Opera area. Known as the Motos Brav-M, it is a \"controversial police unit\", as \"some have accused [them] of using excessive force\". They were \"booed and hissed\" at as they \"passed further away down Boulevard de l\\'Opéra\". By 6pm, \"most people [were] now dispersing\", but \"low-level clashes between police and small groups of rioters [who have] been throwing stones and starting fires\" persisted. Up to 5,000 security staff were put on duty in Paris for the day. 320 protests were planned across the country, with the biggest demonstrations in the southern towns of Marseille, Nice, and Toulon; in the former two, \"thousands of protesters\" demonstrated. Marseille\\'s port was blockaded by demonstrators for a second consecutive day. In Lyon, \"hundreds of railway workers, students and others have taken to the tracks disrupting trains\". In Normandy, \"thousands\" turned out in Rouen, Caen, Le Havre and Dieppe. In Rouen, riot police used tear gas against some protesters throwing stones, and in Rennes, used both tear gas and water cannons as \"some masked protesters\" erected barricades\". In Nice, protesters converged on the city centre, before marching to the airport and forming a blockade.Yahoo! quoted local media that stated almost 10,000 were marching in Tours, where protesters blocked train tracks and caused disruption to train departures. Smoke was observed rising from burning debris that blocked traffic on a Toulouse highway, as \"wildcat strikes briefly blocked roads in other cities\". Police fired tear gas at protesters in Nantes, where also \"a group of activists stormed the administrative court\", and used water cannons in Rennes.. In Lorient, a local newspaper reported that projectiles were thrown into the yard of the police station, having \"triggered a brief fire\", with claims that multiple police officers had been \"violently attacked\". A local prefecture office also \"came under attack\" in the town, The Times claiming that activists \"sought to storm a government building and to set fire to the town\\'s police station\". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin responded on Twitter: \"The attacks on and defacing of the subprefecture and the police station in Lorient are unacceptable. Thoughts with the injured officers. These acts cannot go unpunished.\"The Independent reported that a \"video on social media showed several trucks dumping tyres, rubbish and manure in front of council offices in several locations\", and \"[h]ighways were blocked with barriers of burning wood and tyres as protesters raised slogans\".The Palais Rohan in Bordeaux was set on fire by protesters, affecting the front door, though the fire was put out promptly by firefighters.. In the evening, Interior Minister Darmanin made a statement where he declared that there had been an attempt to kill police officers by some protesters. BBC News and France 24 claim he announced 123 police officers had been injured nationwide, while an independent journalist said he claimed 149 had been injured in Paris alone. In Paris, one officer was \"dragged to safety while unconscious, as he and his colleagues came under fire from fireworks and other missiles. The officer appeared to have been hit on the head\". In Rouen, a young woman was reported to have lost her thumb after hit by a \\'flash ball\\' grenade used by police to try and disperse protesters – Damien Adam, Renaissance MP for the area, \"says it\\'s \"clearly unacceptable\" and he wants a police inquiry to find out what happened\" – and police confirmed two officers were injured after missiles were thrown at them. LFI officials have \"complained that six protesters had been hurt by police tear gas and stun grenades and wants to know what orders officers were given\".Darmanin claimed over 80 people had been arrested so far. Shortages of firefighters in the evening meant that local residents themselves had to put out fires themselves; Darmanin claimed 140 fires needed to be put out in Paris, with 50 still burning at the time (approximately 8:30pm GMT).In the afternoon, union heads Berger and Martinez spoke out. Berger appealed for non-violence, for the \"respect of property and people\", for \"non-violent actions that don\\'t handicap people\\'s daily lives\". Martinez claimed Macron was blamed for the actions of protesters and demonstrators, saying he had \"thrown a can of petrol on the fire\". Hugh Schofield of BBC News said that unions and the left \"are calling the day a success, with once again a large turn-out of people showing their rejection of Macron\\'s pension bill\". 28 March. On 28 March, a tenth day of protests was estimated at 740,000 attendees by the French government and 2 million by unions. Prime Minister Borne declined formal mediation, but agreed to talks with eight leading union leaders the following week, when an eleventh day of protest was planned. 6 April. The union leaders\\' meeting with Borne on 5 April ended after about an hour after both sides insisted that the pension reform must respectively be cancelled or remain. Union leaders exiting the meeting called for an eleventh day of protests to go ahead the following day. According to French authorities, between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators were expected, with 60,000 to 90,000 in Paris. According to the French Interior Ministry, 111 arrests were made and 154 police officers were injured. Protesters started a fire at Café de la Rotonde, one of Macron\\'s favourite restaurants, and other protesters stormed the office buildings of BlackRock and Natixis Investment Managers. 14 April. On 14 April, the Constitutional Council delivered its verdict on the pension bill, declaring it to be compatible with the Constitution. Prior to the ruling being made public, French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne had said that the proposal was \"nearing the end of its democratic process,\" and said there were \"no winners or losers.\" Macron signed the bill later that same day. Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said the government is already working hard to implement the changes by 1 September. Before the Constitutional Council\\'s decision, Macron invited labour unions to meet with him. The unions rejected Macron\\'s invitation, noting that he had refused their previous offers of a meeting, and called for mass new protests on 1 May, International Workers Day. 17 April. On 17 April, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to a government action plan in the next 100 days to decrease anger over the pension reform. Macron had also acknowledged the anger over the increasing prices jobs that didn\\'t \"allow too many French people to live well\". Macron also stated that he wanted the Prime Minister, Élisabeth Borne, to take measure on work, law and order, education, and health conditions and issues. 19 April. During Emmanuel Macron\\'s tour of France, protesters gathered in Muttersholtz, wearing CGT vests and held unwelcoming signs and banners, including one banner which threatened to cancel the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics if Macron did not withdraw the pension reform. The protesters, who banged pots and pans in order to be heard, were pushed back by police in numerous locations across the country. 20 April. Continuing his tour, Emmanuel Macron was jeered by crowds in eastern France in Sélestat, in Alsace. Locals chanted for Macron to resign and some heckled him. Macron noted that the incidents would not stop him from making visits across France. 1 May. After the calling for mass new protests on International Workers\\' Day, clashes erupted between protesters and security forces on 1 May. French President Emmanuel Macron was greeted with pot-bashing and jeers as he toured the country. During the tour, Macron thanked the French workers to their contributions to the nation, however he did not mention the ongoing protests. Effigies of Macron and Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin were abused or burned across France, including the city of Strasbourg. In Paris, windows were broken at banks and estate agents, projectiles were thrown at law enforcement, including one who was hit with a Molotov cocktail, suffering severe burns to his face and hands. Tear gas was deployed by police officers in the cities of Toulouse and Nantes, and property damage occurred in Nantes, Lyon, and Marseille. That day, 2.3 million people protested according to the protest organizers, while 800,000 protesters were estimated by French authorities. 108 police officers were injured in the clashes, 19 seriously injured in Paris, and 291 protesters were arrested. 2 May. After the May Day protests, French trade unions on 2 May announced a new day of nationwide protests against Macron\\'s pension reform, setting the future protests on June 6. The next round marks the 14th wave of protests since the signing of the reform. The government responded that it wanted to \"move on\" to other issues and stated that it will send invitations to the unions for talks, and that the government would use it to reaffirm their opposition to the pension reform and work on proposals to improve workers\\' conditions. 3 May. On 3 May, France\\'s Constitutional Council rejected a second bid for pension referendum by political opponents. The council issued a statement stating that the proposed referendum failed the legal criteria, which was defined in the constitution, and it also failed to address the required reform regarding social policy. As a result, protests ensued, including some in the financial district of Paris. While the protests continued, Nasser Kanaani, spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, called on the French government to refrain from violence against protesters. 8 May. While Macron celebrated Victory Day, law enforcement banned gatherings in Paris and Lyon. In Lyon, several streets were closed to traffic, public transportation was disrupted, and some parking was prohibited. Despite the restrictions, protests and bangs of pots and pans followed, in which authorities responded with tear gas being spread. Clashes also erupted at Montluc prison, where Macron paid tribute to a leading resistance figure, Jean Moulin, when protesters attempted to break through a riot police cordon, who were deployed to keep them away from the French president. 19 May. Hospital workers protested in front of Carlton Cannes Hotel on 19 May, violating the ban on protests throughout most of the city. 21 May. Dozens of protestors gathered in Gannes in the outskirts of Cannes Film Festival on 21 May. Local authorities ordered a ban on protests throughout most of the city. 6 June. 280,000 protesters marched on 6 June, while strikes forced Orly Airport to cancel one-third of its flights that day. Protesters also stormed the headquarters of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, briefly occupying the headquarters building, however no damage occurred. 11,000 law enforcement officers were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris. General impact and analysis. Concerns over increasing violence. Multiple outlets, including media and unions, have grown concern over the increasing use of violence in the protests, particularly in the days since the government invoked Article 49.3, with comparisons made to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests of the first years of Macron\\'s presidency. On 19 March, The Guardian commented that as \"police brace[d] for a week of unpredictable, spontaneous protests in cities and small towns across France, the mood of anger was likened to the start of the gilets jaunes protests\". On 20 March, Reuters also voiced that the tone of the protests had deteriorated to, and were \"reminiscent\" to, that of the Yellow Vest protest in recent days. Euronews, on 21 March, claimed that \"government insiders and observers have raised fears that France is again heading for another bout of violent anti-government protests\". On 22 March, Reuters outlined that \"[p]rotests against the bill have drawn huge crowds in rallies organised by unions since January\", of which \"[m]ost have been peaceful, but anger has mounted since the government pushed the bill through parliament without a vote last week\"; \"[t]he past six nights have seen fierce demonstrations across France with bins set ablaze and scuffles with police\".France 24 commented that unions had been \"united in coordinating their protests\", but that \"many expressed fears they could lose control of the protests as more radical demonstrators set the tone\". Fabrice Coudour, a leading representative for the \\'hard-left\\' CGT, commented that \"tougher action ahead, more serious and further-reaching\" was possible that could \"escape our collective decision-making\". Jean-Marie Pernot, a political scientist specialising in trade unions, said that a lack of \"respect [for] any of the channels meant for the expression of dissent, it will find a way to express itself directly\". One of the Yellow Vests\\' \"prominent spokesmen\", Jerome Rodrigues, spoke to protesters outside the National Assembly after the invoking of Article 49.3 on 17 March, that \"the objective was now nothing less than \"the defeat\" of the president.\"Head of the UNSA trade union federation, Lauren Escure, admitted that \"when there is this much anger and so many French people on the streets, the more radical elements take the floor\", and that it was not something they would want, but was inevitable, and \"will be entirely the government\\'s fault,\" he told AFP. The heads of two \\'moderate\\' unions, Cyril Chabanier of CFTC and Laurent Berger of CFDT, expressed that unions were concerned. Cabanier said that an impression that \"it is just violence that pays\" was being created, and that \"[t]here are some people who are very angry, [and] the anger leads to greater radicalisation and radicalisation unfortunately leads to violence\". Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24\\'s words, \"achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations\". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be \"withdrawn\", that his union \"condemn[s] violence\", but added \"look at the anger. It\\'s very strong, even among our ranks\".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that – alongside the leader of the Republicans\\' office being vandalised – other MPs from the party were \"receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day\". Frédérique Meunier told BFMTV that \"[i]t\\'s as if tomorrow they want to decapitate us\", and that the emails being received \"amounted to harassment\". The constituency offices of Renaissance MPs – the party from which Macron originates – were also targeted. BBC News\\'s Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, on 22 March, said that the protests in recent days had been \"spectacular, sometimes, visually\" but \"not huge in terms of scale\" and \"mostly .. the work of very committed left-wingers, class-warrior types, who are leading the battle\". Natasha Butler of Al Jazeera said the violence in recent days was \"sporadic\". Waste collection strike. A strike by waste collectors began on 6 March, which included a blockade of the city\\'s incinerators. Originally set to last nine days, it was extended by another five on 15 March. As of 15 March, \"bin lorries [were] grounded at depots and at least three waste incinerators in the Paris area [were] at a standstill\".The impact of the waste workers\\' strike has left thousands of tonnes of rubbish uncollected on the streets of Paris. On 17 March, it was estimated the amount was 10,000 tonnes, up from 7,600 earlier in the week. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that \"strikers were being forced back under emergency powers designed to safeguard essential services\", and from the morning of 17 March told RTL radio that \"requisitioning is working and bins are being emptied\", although this was disputed by an aide of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Hidalgo has maintained her support for the strikers despite efforts by government to break it, with the deputy mayor in charge of waste, Colombe Brossel, commenting that \"any demand to force strikers back to work would be \"an attack on the constitutional right to strike\".\"Paris\\' municipal waste collectors started its strike and blockade of the city\\'s incinerators twelve days earlier; the proposed pension reforms would raise their retirement age from 57 to 59. Waste collection in Paris is split around half-and-half between them and private companies, who remained in operation with some taking contracts to operate in areas worst hit by the strike action; such as the ninth district, whose mayor, Delphine Burkli, suggested \"calling in the army to clear the streets.\"Waste collection strikes also affected Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre.On 18 March, the mayor of Paris\\' 12th district, Emmanuelle Pierre-Marie, said that the priority was food waste in the streets – AP describing the \"uncollected garbage\" as having \"become a visual and olfactory symbol of the actions to defeat the president\\'s pension reform plan\" – \"because it is what brings pests to the surface\" and that they \"are extremely sensitive to the situation. As soon as we have a dumpster truck available, we give priority to the places most concerned, like food markets.\" It was claimed that police had \"requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods\".As of 19 March, Philippe Martinez from CGT had \"urged\" Paris collection workers to continue their now-two-week-long strike.The strike was suspended on 29 March due to declining participation, partly due to requisitions order by the Paris police. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were \"charged with actual offences\". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a \"clear reason why\", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were \"rounded up\", police justifying the arrests for their \"participation in a group with a view to preparing violence\", or \"concealing their faces\"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to \"file a collective complaint against the police for \"arbitrary detention\" and \"obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate\".\"Such \"arbitrary police custody\", \"mass-arrest\", tactics have been accused – by politicians, judges and lawyers alike – of being utilised \"simply to frustrate the protest movement\", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a \"repression of the social movement\". This view was shared by a judges\\' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used \"criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom,\" said Raphaël Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods\". Fabien Jobard, research director at France\\'s National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a \"judicialisation of policing\" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of \"participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage\"; its original remit of mitigating against \\'gang violence\\' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the \"violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests\" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Clément Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that \"there are no unjustified arrests\", and people are questioned for \"offences which, in our eyes, are constituted\" and \"48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short\". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding \"when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others\"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the \"manoeuvre is risky\", as they \"expose the workforce, monopolise officers\" and \"risk radicalising the demonstrators\".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the \"police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week\". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were \"on pretty brutal form\" – stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press – and were also throwing their stun grenades with \"abandon\". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron\\'s proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy\\'s 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy\\'s push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which \"were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system\". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" and could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\". Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support – unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) – and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a référendum d\\'initiative partagée (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an \\'RIP\\' would need to have been done \"before the enactment of the law\"; yet, according to Stéphane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated \"the retirement age cannot exceed 62\". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, \"thwarting Macron\\'s plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government\\'s other work.\"Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, \"several appeals\" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would \"argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances\", and that \"[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France\\'s Conseil d\\'État (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan\\'s lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional\".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III\\'s state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King\\'s visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised. The author of a biography of the late Queen Elizabeth II, Stephen Clarke, said it was \"very bad timing\", and that while the people of France would \"normally ... welcome a British king\", \"in this moment, people protesting are on high alert for any sign of privilege and wealth\"; Associated Press (AP) commented that \"what was meant to be a show of bonhomie and friendship ... instead ... is being seen as an unnecessary display of hereditary privilege\". He added that the King and Queen Consort\\'s plans to attend a \"lavish dinner at the former royal residence, the Versailles Palace\", \"does not look good\", and \"seems very 1789\". Associated Press clarified that the \"lavish Versailles, once the dazzling center of royal Europe, is a potent symbol of social inequalities and excess\". The Daily Telegraph reported that the banquet, intended to take place on 27 March, could be cancelled or moved.EELV MP Sandrine Rousseau called for the trip to be cancelled, asking if \"the priority [is] really to receive Charles III at Versailles? Something is taking place within French society... the priority is to go and talk to society which is rising up.\"On 23 March, Associated Press reported how the CGT\\'s members at Mobilier National (the institution in charge of providing flags, red carpets and furniture for public buildings) \"would not help prepare a Sunday reception for the king upon his arrival in Paris\"; in response, the Élysée Palace said \"non-striking workers would set up the necessary accoutrements for the trip\". On 23 March, unions called for their tenth day of nationwide action for 28 March, coinciding with the last full day of the state visit.On 24 March, at the request of the French Government, the state visit was postponed. Macron reportedly decided it would no longer be feasible or appropriate for the visit to take place once unions announced the tenth day of national walkouts on the 28 March, during the state visit. Éric Ciotti, leader of the Republicans said the cancellation brought \"shame on our country\", while Mélenchon was of an opposing mood, \"delighted\" that the \"meeting of kings at Versailles\" had been broken up, and that \"the English knew that France\\'s interior minister was pathetic on security\". The visit was rescheduled for some time in the summer, \"when things calm down again\". International reactions. Iran condemned what it called France\\'s repression of protests. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said \"We call on the French government to respect human rights\" and further added \"instead of creating chaos in other countries, listen to the voice of your people and avoid violence against them.\"France\\'s Human Rights League has accused the authorities of disproportionate and dangerous use of public force, undermining citizens\\' right to protest. The league\\'s president said \"The authoritarian shift of the French state, the brutalisation of social relations through its police, violence of all kinds and impunity are a major scandal.\"Rights groups and independent bodies, including the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, have criticized French police for resorting to excessive force and for making preventative arrests that could amount to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The French Defender of Rights noted on March 21 that \"this practice may induce a risk of disproportionately resorting to custodial measures and fostering tensions.\" Human Rights Watch told AFP it was very concerned about \"what appears to be abusive police practices.\"According to Reporters Without Borders, several \"clearly identifiable\" journalists were assaulted by security forces during the demonstrations.On March 20, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities that “peaceful demonstrations are a fundamental right that the authorities must guarantee and protect. Law enforcement officers must facilitate them and avoid excessive use of force.”The Council of Europe condemned France\\'s crackdown on protests and warned that sporadic acts of violence could not justify \"excessive use of force by agents of the state.\"White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated \"We support the right of people to protest and to express their opinions\" when asked about the situation in France.Dimitris Koutsoumpas, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece, attended a rally in Paris on 23 March; in a statement from Bastille Square, expressing his solidarity with the \"struggle of the French people ... against anti-labor policies, against the anti-popular choices\" utilised by both the French and the Greek governments in order to ensure the working people \"finally win\" and \"pave the way for their own interests and not the interests and profits of the few.\" The International Anthem was played over loudspeakers, with the railway workers and trade unionists being spoken to offering him a \"Friends of the Paris Commune\" handkerchief.

      "{'input': ' Tectonic setting. Geology. Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three tectonic plates; the African Plate, Arabian Plate and Anatolian Plate. The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is represented by the Dead Sea Transform (DST)—a major zone of left-lateral strike-slip fault—it accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa. The northern end of the DST truncates at the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) another major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian Plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian Plate. The DST and EAF meet at the Marash Triple Junction. The EAF continues west of the triple junction, forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the Cyprus arc to the west via the Latakia Ridge.The 700 km-long (430 mi) EAF is subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast; the Karlıova, Ilıca, Palu, Pütürge, Erkenek, Pazarcık and Amanos segments. The Amanos segment is also considered part of the DST by some geologists, or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others. A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognized, including the Sürgü, Çardak, Savrun, Çokak, Toprakkale, Yumurtalık, Karataş, Yakapınar and Düziçi–İskenderun segments. The estimated slip rate on the main strand of the EAF system decreases south-westwards from 10 mm (0.39 in) per year on the Karlıova segment down to 2.9 mm (0.11 in) per year on the Amanos segment. On the northern strand, a slip rate of 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per year was estimated on the Çardak segment. The Sürgü-Çardak Fault is an east-west striking 160 km (99 mi) long fault that runs north of the EAF. Comprising two segments; the Sürgü Fault runs 70 km (43 mi) between Çelikhan and Nurhak; the Çardak Fault runs 90 km (56 mi) between Nurhak and Göksun. Seismicity on the fault is low—the only associated earthquake was a M 6.8 event in 1544.The northern part of the DST is subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between scientists as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure. Following the 2013 \"Active Fault Map of Turkey\", seven DST segments are recognized in Turkey and neighbouring parts of Syria; the Afrin, Sermada, Armanaz, Hacıpaşa, Yesemek, Sakçagöz and Narlı segments. Seismicity. The EAF has produced large or damaging earthquakes in the past few hundred years along various segments, including the 1789 (M 7.2, Palu), 1795 (M 7.0, Pazarcık), 1866 (M 7.2 Karlıova), 1872 (M 7.2, Amanos), 1874 (M 7.1, Palu), 1875 (M 6.7, Palu), 1893 (M 7.1, Erkenek), 1971 (M6.6, Karlıova) and 2020 (Mw\\u202f6.8, Pütürge) events. Other large historical earthquakes have been tentatively assigned to segments of the EAF, such as the 1114 and 1513 Marash earthquakes, both thought to have ruptured the Pazarcık segment.The Palu and Pütürge segments in the east display a recurrence interval of about 150 years for M 6.8–7.0 earthquakes. The Pazarcık and Amanos segments in the west have recurrence intervals of 237–772 years and 414–917 years, respectively, for M 7.0–7.4 earthquakes. A research paper published by Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2002 studied stress accumulation and increased seismic hazard along the East Anatolian Fault. The study concluded two sections of the fault with considerably high potential for future earthquakes. One of these sections was in Elazığ and Bingöl, located between the rupture zones of the 1874 and 1971 earthquakes. The seismic gap ruptured during a Mw\\u202f 6.1 earthquake in 2010. The 2020 Mw\\u202f 6.8 earthquake ruptured to the southwest between the 1893/1905 and 1874 earthquakes. Another seismic gap was located in Kahramanmaraş—this 103 km (64 mi) long section—according to the study, believed to last rupture in 1513 has the potential to produce magnitude 7.3 earthquakes.Large earthquakes on the northern part of the DST include events in 115, 526, 587, 1138, 1170 and 1822, which resulted in several tens of thousands to several hundreds of thousands of fatalities. Earthquake sequence. The first and largest earthquake in the sequence struck at 01:17 UTC. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) measured it at Mww\\u202f7.8 and Mw\\u202f7.8, respectively. GEOSCOPE reported Mw\\u202f8.0 and Kandilli Observatory (KOERI) reported Mw\\u202f7.7 and ML\\u202f7.4. It had an epicenter at 37.166°N 37.032°E\\ufeff / 37.166; 37.032, 34 km (21 mi) west of Gaziantep in Gaziantep Province, which is near the border with Syria. The earthquake hypocenter was at a depth of 10.0 km (6 mi) according to USGS and 5 km (3 mi) according to KOERI. The shock had a focal mechanism corresponding to strike-slip faulting.It is one of the strongest ever recorded in Turkey, equivalent in magnitude to the 1939 Erzincan earthquake (Mw\\u202f7.8). These earthquakes are surpassed only by the larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake. Globally it was the strongest recorded since August 2021. Both earthquakes are the largest and only observed to occur on land and within a short span of time. At 10:24 UTC, an earthquake measuring Mww\\u202f7.5 according to USGS, Mw\\u202f7.6 according to KOERI, or Mw\\u202f7.7 according to Geoscope and the GCMT, struck with an epicenter near Ekinözü, 95 km northeast of the M7.8 event. It had a depth of 7.4 km (5 mi) according to the USGS, 5 km (3 mi) by KOERI, and 13 km (8 mi) by Geoscope.A reevaluation of the earthquakes using long-period coda moment magnitude obtained moment magnitudes of Mw\\u202f 7.95 ± 0.013 and Mw\\u202f 7.86 ± 0.012, respectively. These earthquakes were the largest Turkish earthquakes in over 2,000 years. Aftershocks. Over 570 aftershocks were recorded within 24 hours of the Mw\\u202f7.8 earthquake and over 30,000 recorded by May 2023. An aftershock measuring Mww\\u202f6.7 occurred about 11 minutes after the mainshock. There were 25 aftershocks Mw\\u202f4.0 or greater recorded within six hours of the main tremor, according to the USGS. More than 12 hours later, the USGS had reported at least 54 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude, while the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) recorded at least 120 total aftershocks. A Mww\\u202f6.3 aftershock struck near Uzunbağ in Hatay Province on 20 February; the earthquake was the result of oblique-normal faulting. The Mw\\u202f 7.8 earthquake had aftershocks distributed along ~350 km (220 mi) of the EAF.The Mw\\u202f7.7 earthquake triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two mb 6.0 aftershocks. Aftershocks of the second earthquake continued through at least 9 Feb. Thousands of aftershocks associated with this earthquake were distributed along an east-west trend corresponding to the Çardak Fault for about 170 km (110 mi). Seismology. A source model for the Mww\\u202f7.8 earthquake produced by the USGS from observed seismic waves, taking into account preliminary rupture mapping from satellite data, uses three fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >40 km (25 mi) × 30 km (19 mi), 028°/85° (Segment 1), >175 km (109 mi) × 30 km (19 mi), 060°/85° (Segment 2) and >160 km (99 mi) × 20 km (12 mi), 025°/75° (Segment 3). The mainshock produced a maximum slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2, beneath Sakarya in Kahramanmaraş Province, northeast of the junction where it meets Segment 1. Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Adıyaman.The USGS source model for the Mw\\u202f7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70 km (43 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 276°/80° (Segment 1), >40 km (25 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 250°/80° (Segment 2) and ~80 km (50 mi) × >20 km (12 mi), 060°/80° (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4 m (37 ft).Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw\\u202f 7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarcık and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370 km (230 mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of 9 m (30 ft) along the Pazarcık segment. The northern end of the rupture was about 20–30 km (12–19 mi) south of the Mw\\u202f 6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the Pütürge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12 m (39 ft) from the surface to 7 km (4.3 mi) depth during the Mw\\u202f 7.7 earthquake; slip was 11 m (36 ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact—mostly confined to within the Çardak Fault; it was also shallower—attenuating from 8–12 km (5.0–7.5 mi). Slip during the Mw\\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw\\u202f 7.7 event. The Mw\\u202f 6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25 km (16 mi) × 25 km (16 mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth.Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the Çardak–Sürgü Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that is was already close to failure. Stress on the Hatay Fault, source of the 20 February Mw\\u202f 6.4 aftershock, increased by 1 bar following the 6 February earthquakes. Rupture propagation. Preliminary analysis based on seismology and observations of surface rupture suggest the following sequence of events: initial rupture at the site of the epicenter of the M7.8 shock on the Narlı Fault, the northernmost section of the Dead Sea Transform. The fault ruptured unilaterally northwards until it reached the Pazarcık segment of the East Anatolian Fault. Ruptures then continued bilaterally to the northeast and southwest along this segment. This subevent on the Narlı Fault corresponded to a Mw\\u202f 7.0 earthquake which ruptured for 20 seconds. It had a focal mechanism corresponding to oblique-normal faulting. A preliminary analysis of near-field (within 1 km (0.62 mi) of the fault rupture) seismic records indicates that the initial rupture speed transitioned to supershear after propagating about 19.5 km (12.1 mi) away from the epicenter along the Narlı Fault before it reached the EAF. Back projection suggest the total rupture length was ~560 km (350 mi).The rupture continued northeast onto the Ekernek segment and to the southwest onto the Amanos segment. The northeastern rupture ceased 55 seconds after initiation while the southwestern rupture ceased near Antakya about 80 seconds later. A Mw\\u202f6.8 aftershock occurring 11 minutes later and west of the first M>7 epicenter may have ruptured along the Sakçagöz Fault, the next segment of the Dead Sea Transform to the south. Rupture along the EAF during the event occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 3.2 km (2.0 mi) per second). An analysis of near-field seismic data revealed transient supershear rupture episodes throughout the EAF rupture. Supershear rupture occurred along the northernmost section of the Narlı Fault where it meets the EAF. The rupture transitioned onto the EAF and propagated northeast at supershear velocity until its termination near Malatya. Rupture towards the southwest was mostly subshear, but at the southern termination in Hatay, where the fault has multiple branches and kinks, supershear was likely observed. Supershear rupture at the southern termination contributed to the intense ground motion in Antakya.The second M>7 earthquake initiated on a separate fault known as the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone, part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault. The rupture propagated bilaterally along the Çardak segment, continuing eastwards onto the Sürgü segment before continuing eastwards to Malatya along the northeast–southwest trending Doğanşehir Fault Zone. Rupture also propagated towards the southwest along the Çardak segment. The total rupture length was estimated at 160 km (99 mi). The westward-propagating rupture occurred at supershear velocity (maximum 4.8 km (3.0 mi) per second) while the eastward-propagating rupture occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 2.8 km (1.7 mi) per second). The rupture lasted about 35 seconds.The Mw\\u202f 6.4 aftershock on 20 February occurred along the Hatay Fault. The focal mechanism indicated normal faulting along a northeast-southwest striking fault. Surface rupture. The extent of surface ruptures associated with the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes have been mapped using a mixture of satellite imagery and ground observations. Pixel matching on images captured by Sentinel-1 before and after the earthquakes showed sharp discontinuities in displacement, revealing two separate zones of surface rupture. The longer of the pair, produced by the first earthquake, measured 320 km (200 mi) while the second earthquake produced 150 km (93 mi) of surface rupture. These observations were backed up with direct imaging of the ruptures using other satellite data, such as from the DigitalGlobe\\'s WorldView-1, 2 & 3 and GeoEye-1, and by field work. Remote sensing using satellite imagery indicated 30 km (19 mi) of surface rupture with large normal faulting component.. The zone of surface rupture extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş Province and Gölbaşı, Adıyaman Province. Surface ruptures continued north of these cities. Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley. The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation. A major canal was damaged and lead to flooding in parts of the Amik Valley which was formerly Lake Amik. Field observations indicate a maximum displacement of 7.3 m (24 ft) on the surface. Geologists traced a 15 km (9.3 mi) surface rupture trending south from Pazarcık with an offset of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). From Golbasi to Nurdağı ground displacements were up to 5 m (16 ft). The surface rupture observed during the M7.8 earthquake was unusually large, comparable to that during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake along the San Andreas Fault.Large surface offsets of 6–8 m (20–26 ft) were observed along the Sürgü-Çardak Fault. The largest offset was measured along a road west of Gözpınar; the rupture displaced the road left-laterally for 8.6 m (28 ft). Ground motion. Ground acceleration values recorded in some areas near the fault rupture were in excess of 1 g. Three USGS seismic installations, two at Antakya and one at Hassa, recorded large ground accelerations and velocities. The town of Hassa recorded 0.9082 g in ground acceleration (pga) and 215.34 cm/s (84.78 in/s) in ground velocity. The station data corresponded to a Modified Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). A peak ground acceleration of 1.62 g was recorded by a station at Fevzipaşa. The peak ground acceleration generally exceeded 0.5 g in a large area around the epicenter, near Adiyaman and a large part of Hatay. High pga values of 2 g were recorded in Hatay. The maximum recorded pga was 2.212 g at a station in Pazarcık Belediyesi Parkı, Pazarcık; a government health facility nearby had sparce damage but the surrounding town was devastated. The maximum recorded pga during the Mw\\u202f 7.7 earthquake was 0.59 g at Göksun.According to Kandilli Observatory, the maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of the mainshock was estimated to have reached MMI XI–XII (Extreme) in Antakya and near the epicenter. MMI XI (Extreme) or higher was observed along the fault rupture from the epicenter to Antakya. The MMI also reached IX–X (Violent–Extreme) in Kahramanmaraş and İskenderun, VIII–IX (Severe–Violent) in Malatya and Adıyaman, VII–VIII (Very strong–Severe) in Gaziantep, Kilis, Idlib and Aleppo, and VI–VII (Strong–Very strong) in Adana and Şanlıurfa. The maximum MMI of the second earthquake was X (Extreme). Geological effects. Liquefaction was identified via satellite and remote sensing along the southern portion of the Mw\\u202f7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments. These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.  Liquefaction was also observed in Samandağ. At Lake Gölbaşı, Adıyaman Province, lateral spreading occurred along the northern, eastern and southern coast. Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged. Gölbaşı was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.. Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in İskenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atatürk Boulevard in Çay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure. The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200 m (660 ft). Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at İskenderun.Despite an epicenter 90 km (56 mi) inland, a tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea. Small tsunami waves were recorded off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, without damage. The tsunami measured 0.17 m (6.7 in), and tsunami waves were recorded at 0.12 m (4.7 in) at İskenderun and 0.13 m (5.1 in) at Erdemli. Tsunami warnings were issued for the southern Turkish coast, southern and eastern Italian coasts and the whole eastern Mediterranean Sea area, but later withdrawn. Damage and casualties. In Turkey. There were 50,783 deaths, 297 missing and 107,204 injured across 11 of the 17 affected provinces of Turkey. At least 15.73 million people and 4 million buildings were affected. About 345,000 apartments were destroyed. More than 2 million residents in the affected provinces were evacuated to nearby provinces including Mersin, Antalya, Mardin, Niğde and Konya. More than 20 percent of Turkey\\'s agriculture production was affected. The United Nations said crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and rural infrastructure were heavily damaged. At least 516 university buildings were affected, of which 106 were heavily damaged.By 23 February 2023, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change conducted damage inspections for 1.25 million buildings; revealing 164,000 buildings were either destroyed or severely damaged. A further 150,000 commercial infrastructure were at least moderately damaged. The International Organization for Migration estimated over 2.7 million people were made homeless. A damage assessment by the Turkish government revealed at least 61,722 buildings had to be demolished including 11,900 in Gaziantep Province, 10,900 in Hatay Province, 10,800 in Kahramanmaraş Province and 28,914 in Malatya Province. Broad fissures appeared on roads. During recovery efforts, body parts were often found in the rubble.. In Adana, 12 buildings collapsed in the city center, 23 were badly damaged and 120 were moderately damaged. Three apartments were among the buildings that collapsed in the city. Across Adana Province, damage assessments revealed 59 buildings and 1,274 apartments were destroyed or required demolition.At least 300 buildings were razed in Malatya. Sixty percent of the city\\'s buildings received damage. Nearly every neighborhood of the city was affected by collapsed buildings. Out of the 968 mosques in the city, 25 were destroyed and 420 others were damaged. Two hotels collapsed in Malatya, causing many casualties. The ceiling of Malatya Erhaç Airport experienced a partial collapse, as did the historic Yeni Camii mosque. Damage was also reported at the Arslantepe Mound. In Akçadağ, 11 people died, including four attributed to the second earthquake. At least 263 deaths were reported in Doğanşehir.In Gaziantep, many of the historical sites were severely damaged, such as Gaziantep Castle, Şirvani Mosque and Liberation Mosque. The city recorded 16,211 collapses and buildings which were severely damaged or required demolition. In the city center, at least 154 people died after a four-story building collapsed; four other collapsed buildings left another 102 dead. In Nizip, at least 51 people were killed when a six-story apartment building collapsed.In Nurdağı, nearly 2,500 people died and about 50 percent of the houses were badly damaged or destroyed.

It remains to be seen whether the governing coalition, with its 333 seats in parliament, can surpass the 400-number hurdle needed to pass such proposals by changing the constitution. On 18 February, AKP authorities stated that the elections would not be delayed.Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the CHP opposed its postponement on constitutional grounds. Mustafa Tolga Öztürk, YSK member of the İYİ party stated that YSK does not have any power to postpone an election and only parliament has the right to do so, adding that Turkey had no more time to lose with the AKP. Selahattin Demirtaş of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) has described the postponement as a political coup. The declaration of state of emergency in the affected regions was also interpreted as a possible measure to postpone elections. Nevertheless, the earthquake led to the main anti-Erdoğan coalition postponing its 13 February meeting for the selection of its consensus presidential candidate to 6 March.At the elections, the Erdoğan-lead elecotral People\\'s Alliance retained its majority in the Grand National Assembly, while Erdoğan in the first round of the presidential election received 49.5% with 52.2% in the second one against Kılıçdaroğlu. This marked the first time a Turkish presidential election went into a run-off. Education. On 9 February, the Council of Higher Education said education and training at universities in the affected provinces would be suspended until further notice. Student hostels managed by the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels would be used to house affected individuals. The minister of national education, Mahmut Özer, ordered a week-long closure of all schools in the country, which was later extended to two weeks. Schools in the affected provinces were suspended until 10 March. Students studying in schools located in the affected provinces would be transferred to other provinces of their choice. Sports. After the earthquake, Süper Lig was suspended for over a week to mourn the victims. Clubs from affected regions: Süper Lig clubs Hatayspor, Gaziantep FK, TFF First League club Yeni Malatyaspor, Adanaspor, TFF Second League club Adıyaman FK, Diyarbekirspor and TFF Third League clubs Kahramanmaraşspor, Osmaniyespor FK and Malatya Arguvan SK withdrew from competition. Sivas Belediyespor, Tarsus İdman Yurdu and Niğde Anadolu requested to withdraw but TFF did not approve their requests.On 6 February, it was announced the 2023 ISF World School Winter Games, which were due to be held in Erzurum, were canceled due to the \\'force majeure\\' situation in the country. On 10 February, it was announced the 2023 Men\\'s EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup was canceled due to the impact of the earthquake. The tournament was intended to be held from 17 to 19 February in Alanya. In an official statement, Minister of Youth and Sports Mehmet Kasapoğlu announced that every national championship would be suspended with immediate effect, until further communications.All 39 members of the Northern Cypriot Türk Maarif Koleji\\'s high school volleyball team including players, teachers, parents and a trainer died in the collapse of a hotel in Adıyaman.Three players from Iran\\'s national paralympic football team died in Turkey. Hatayspor\\'s Ghanaian winger Christian Atsu died in the collapse of Rönesans Rezidans in Antakya. His body was found on the morning of 18 February. Atsu was a former Chelsea, Newcastle, Bournemouth and Everton player. Basketball player Nilay Aydogan died in Malatya.In the first game of the Super Lig after the earthquake between Fenerbahce Istanbul and Konyaspor, the fans protested the Turkish government and shouted demands for its resignation, which was still heard even after the broadcaster of the game BeIN tried to censor the fans\\' voices. In another football game in Istanbul between Besiktas and Antalyaspor the fans repeated their calls for the government\\'s resignation and threw cuddly toys onto the field. Aftermath in Syria. President Bashar al-Assad held an emergency meeting with his cabinet to organize a rescue plan for the affected regions. He identified Aleppo, Hama and Latakia governates as the most affected. Following orders from President al-Assad, all teams of the civil defense, firefighting, health, and public construction groups were mobilized to the affected governates. He also added that medical services, food and shelter were urgently needed. The Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection was ordered by President al-Assad to supply food and organize teams to distribute them. Technical teams were also on site to evaluate building conditions and evacuate residents in at-risk structures. The Ministry of Water Resources was tasked with rapidly assessing damage to dams, reservoirs and water stations, and ensuring people have access to water.The Syrian government appealed to UN member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations for international aid. Syria also requested for aid from the European Union\\'s European Civil Protection Mechanism, according to commissioner Janez Lenarčič. The Syrian government, through its representative in the United Nations, said that it should be responsible for aid distribution in all areas of the country, including those held by the rebels. The UK government said it would deliver aid through its long-term partners, the White Helmets civilian defense force. The US State Department said it would use its humanitarian partners on the ground.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey. Border crossings into Turkey remained closed on 7 February. Critically injured patients were unable to enter Turkey for medical attention. There were exceptions as to which persons could cross, including individuals holding touristic residence permits who could only cross by foot. The Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing was made accessible on 8 February, according to the UN.Some hotels including in Latakia and Damascus offered to accommodate to survivors free of charge and ensure basic necessities. Refugees and expatriates also opened their homes as shelters for people. Al-Sham Private University started an effort to receive people. Sports facilities, events venues, university dormitories and halls were also opened to take in people. The Syria Trust for Development announced the establishment of shelters across many governorates. Volunteer groups inspected buildings for damage and distributed food items, blankets, and first aid essentials.. Due to the high number of casualties, including trauma cases, many hospitals became overcrowded. Hospitals were already experiencing a shortage of medical supplies prior to the earthquake. Hospitals in many cities were forced to operate far beyond capacity. Many patients at hospitals slept on floors due to the lack of beds. The Ministry of Health dispatched medical convoys from the Health Directorates of Damascus, Rif Dimashq Governorate, Quneitra, Homs, and Tartus, to Aleppo and Latakia to rebel-held areas. Twenty-eight ambulances, seven mobile clinics, and four trucks carrying medical, surgical and emergency aid were also dispatched. Local charities across the country, which typically distribute food during the month of Ramadan, have been exhausted to their fullest capacity. One of these charities, Saed Initiative, planned to establish a charity kitchen to provide free meals for the rest of the year. Between 2,500 and 4,000 meals were distributed every day in Aleppo, and the charity plans to distribute up to 40,000 meals every day. Another charity in the city, the al-Bir and al-Ihsan charity, provided 1,500 meals every day.Over 2,000 Syria Civil Defense (White Helmets) volunteers were sent to all the affected areas to conduct search and rescue efforts. With a lack of equipment and tools, they appealed to other humanitarian organizations for support. Officials on 7 February announced rescue and recovery efforts in Hama ended after 15 hours. Over 298,000 people were left without homes and 180 shelters were opened in government-held areas. About 30,000 people were housed in shelters in Aleppo. As of 10 February, no international rescue workers had arrived in rebel-held Jinderis despite official calls for help.United States sanctions against Syria relating to the blocking of banks and payment processors led to the banning of international charities and families attempting to send money to people affected in Syria. On 7 February 2023, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent urged Western countries to lift sanctions against Syria, saying the measures hurt civilians and humanitarian efforts during the earthquake recovery effort. The sanctions are a series of economic measures taken by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and the Arab League against the Assad regime from the start of the civil war in 2011. They include an oil embargo and the freezing of financial assets of the state and government officials. There were requests to lift or suspend the sanctions to aid humanitarian efforts following the earthquake.On 10 February, the United States announced it would exempt sanctions against Syria for 180 days. The ease of sanctions was for \"all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts\", according to the United States Department of the Treasury. The Syrian Ministry responded in a statement that the US\\' decision was \"misleading and aims to give a false humanitarian impression\" and that \"the facts on the ground proved its falsehood.\" Some commentators have argued that the sanctions do not pose a problem for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria.. International humanitarian assistance began entering northwestern Syria on 9 February via Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. The first convoy of six trucks carried tents and sanitary items. Turkey said it was working to open two additional border crossings. On 10 February, 14 trucks carrying aid crossed from Turkey into Syria, according to the United Nations. The United States Central Command announced it would cooperate with Syrian Democratic Forces to assist the affected population in Syria. On 11 February, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Aleppo, accompanying a shipment of emergency medical supplies. On 12 February, all schools across Syria, except for those in the affected areas, were resumed since the earthquakes struck. Schools in Aleppo, Lattakia, Hama and Idleb remained closed. On 14 February, the Syrian government agreed to open the border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Raée for three months.President al-Assad met UN relief chief Martin Griffiths met on 21 March to discuss post-earthquake recovery and aid. International humanitarian efforts. Countries. Arab League. Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit called for international assistance to help those affected by \"this humanitarian catastrophe\". ASEAN. The Secretariat of ASEAN expressed its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the Governments and peoples of the affected countries, especially the families of the victims of the earthquake. ASEAN affirms its solidarity with the Governments and peoples of Turkiye and Syria in these trying times and stands ready to extend its assistance to the relief efforts. European Union (EU). The European Union\\'s European Civil Protection Mechanism, in which Turkey participates despite not being a member of the EU, was activated at the request of Turkey. The EU dispatched thirty-one rescue teams and five medical teams from 23 member states to Turkey, committed €3 million and €3.5 million to Turkey and Syria respectively, and announced a donor conference to raise money. The Copernicus Programme was also activated to provide emergency mapping services and other help. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that member countries were mobilizing support. The Strategic Airlift Capability was used to transport search and rescue equipment. NATO deployed \"fully equipped semi-permanent shelter facilities\" to house displaced persons in Turkey. Flags at NATO headquarters were also lowered to half-mast. A vessel carrying the first 600 of 1,000 containers for temporary housing left Taranto, Italy for Turkey to accommodate at least 4,000 people. United Nations (UN). Several United Nations agencies announced coordinated responses to the disaster, including UNDAC, OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM. The World Health Organization\\'s Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said the organization\\'s regional offices were assisting international efforts to transport medicine and relief equipment. The UN released $25 million from its emergency fund for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria. A second $25 million grant was released for relief efforts in Syria. UN sent humanitarian aid to Syria through Turkey via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. On 14 February, the UN appealed for €396 million to help survivors in Syria. World Bank. The World Bank said it would provide US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey to support the relief and recovery process. \"We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground,\" said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\\u202f7. However, professor Hasan Sözbilir, Director of Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\\u202f6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 İzmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdoğan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\". Erdoğan\\'s claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuoğlu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdoğan\\'s claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmaraş, were used to dispute Erdoğan\\'s claim.In Adıyaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailoğlu, and governor, Mahmut Çuhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become \\'graveyards\\' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdoğan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdoğan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government\\'s top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdoğan said \"We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,\" In another video, he said \"We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,\"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Adıyaman; 14,719 in Diyarbakır; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmaraş; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in Şanlıurfa. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People\\'s Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; £3.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government\\'s recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples\\' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. İsmail Palakoğlu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbakır Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".A week after the earthquakes in Samandağ, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary \"because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes,\" The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples\\' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\" Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey\\'s opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1, and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council. In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ\\'s statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over \"provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic\" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozdağ, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozdağ said: \"Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary\". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the \"Earthquake Crimes Investigation\" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor\\'s Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for \"spreading misinformation\" or for \"\"provoking the people into animosity and hatred\" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozdağ said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed. A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. The owner of a construction company which built several buildings in Adana was apprehended in Northern Cyprus.The majority of buildings that collapsed in Turkey were constructed before 2000, but some were constructed after that year. Following the 1999 earthquake, building construction followed new regulations and had improved materials. Sukru Ersoy, a geology professor at Yıldız Technical University, said \"corruption is high in the construction sector in Turkey. And therefore, there were abuses\". However, corruption was not always present in local authorities; in Erzin, which has a strict policy against the construction of buildings that violated safety codes in addition to having endured other earthquakes with less damage, became a popular location for survivors elsewhere to take refuge as no collapsed buildings were reported. National mourning. President Erdoğan declared seven days of national mourning in Turkey on Twitter. Seven days of national mourning was observed in Northern Cyprus, and one day in Bangladesh and Kosovo. Albania\\'s prime minister, Edi Rama, said 13 February would be a day of national mourning. On 13 February, all overseas diplomatic missions of North Macedonia lowered the North Macedonian flags to half-mast. Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition. Investigative reports revealed that Syrian government had deliberately obstructed aid to all of Syria\\'s opposition-held areas, including the Idlib region, which was the worst-struck area in the earthquake. Syrian government officials and state-run media blamed United States and European Union sanctions against the country for the lack of humanitarian aid and hampering rescue. On 10 February, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad accused Western countries of having \"no regard for the human condition.\" The US Treasury said its sanctions \"contain robust exemptions for humanitarian efforts\" in the first place, and that after the earthquake it issued a blanket authorization for relief efforts. The United Nations has also been criticized for its policy of focusing aid shipments solely to the regime, at the expense of Syrian lives in opposition-held territories.Idlib region, under the control of Syrian Salvation Government (SSG), was one of the hardest-hit territories. Assad regime\\'s policy of besieging North-West Syria; which blockades the supply of food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies, has further deteriorated the crisis in Idlib. Abu Muhammad Al-Julani, commander of the SSG-aligned Tahrir al-Sham rebel militia, criticized aid agencies of neglecting the situation in Idlib and called on the international community to be more proactive in reconstruction and relief efforts, adding that the \"United Nations needs to understand that it\\'s required to help in a crisis\". Upon traveling to the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing bordering the rebel-held territories, UNOCHA Under-Secretary Martin Griffith stated on 12 February that \"We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria\". As of 13 February, Ankara and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army were accused of blocking aid convoys sent by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria from entering the north-west region.The United Nations criticized Russia\\'s attempts to block delivery of aid through checkpoints to rebel-held territories. Secretary General António Guterres urged the Security Council to immediately permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria. United States appealed for the immediate opening of all closed checkpoints to send in relief efforts to all parts of Syria; calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase humanitarian assistance through Bab al-Hawa and open up more border crossings for the entry of UN aid. Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesperson, said on 14 February, \"some aid is getting into the north-west, pointing to 58 trucks that arrived with aid through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.\" However, the organization does not possess heavy equipment or search and rescue teams. He stressed that the \"international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.\". Raed al-Saleh, chief of Syrian Civil Defence, strongly rebuked the UN for its negligence and delay in responding to the rescue efforts:\"Let me be clear: The White Helmets received no support from the United Nations during the most critical moments of the rescue operations.. The UN\\'s failure to respond quickly to this catastrophe is shameful. When I asked the UN why help had failed to arrive in time, the answer I received was bureaucracy. In the face of one of the deadliest catastrophes to strike the world in years, it seems the UN\\'s hands were tied by red tape.\" Health concerns. Due to below-freezing temperatures in the affected areas in both Turkey and Syria, the mayor of Hatay, Lütfü Savaş, warned about the hypothermia risk. In Adiyaman Province, some residents trapped under rubble died from hypothermia.Concerns arose regarding the possible spread of infection in areas where sanitation facilities were damaged or unfunctional. Due to water shortage experienced in both countries, many survivors could not shower. International health organizations said the shortage of clean water would be a public health risk. The World Health Organization said water shortage \"increases the risk of waterborne diseases and outbreaks of communicable diseases.\"On 18 February, Turkey\\'s Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said there was an increase in intestinal and upper respiratory infection cases but \"numbers did not pose a serious threat to public health.\" At a stadium serving as shelter in Kahramanmaraş, a clinic managed by 15 to 30 medics attended up to 10,000 patients in the day. The clinic provided tetanus shots and sanitary items to residents. Many people at the stadium were unable to shower and the six toilets were unable to accommodate to the large number of people. In Antakya, residents said more portable toilets were needed.Health authorities in Turkey had to ensure earthquake survivors were free of disease. The World Health Organization collaborated with local authorities to monitor the rates of waterborne diseases, seasonal influenza and COVID-19 among the affected.

      "{'input': ' Early life. Claude was born on December 2, 1902, in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia. His parents were Heinrich (Henry) Wilschefski and Mary Frances Carter. Henry had been born in Germany while Mary was born in Gorton, Lancashire, England. Their families had both emigrated to Australia in the late 1800s and they married in 1897. They had three children, Percy Lawrence Wilschefski (1899-1964), Annie Evelyn Wilschefski (1900-1982), and Claude who was the youngest. Henry died in Queensland on November 14, 1903, when Claude was just 11 months old. In 1907 she remarried to Francis Martin List who had also been born in Germany. They had 5 children which became Claude\\'s half siblings though the first born, Norman Andrew List (1908-1908) died as an infant, Alice Holly List (1909-1995), Francis Martin List (1911-1976), Edna Marjorie List (1913-1914), and Irene Maude List (1915-?).. Some time between October 1915 and 1919 the family moved to New Zealand and lived in Glen Eden in 1919 according to census records. Francis was also a senior rugby league player and he and Claude played together on occasion. Playing career. Queensland. Claude List had started playing rugby league in Queensland as a schoolboy at about the age of 10 in 1912. Kingsland Rovers. After moving to New Zealand the family settled in Auckland. The first mention of List is in a team list published on June 10, 1921, in the Auckland Star. He was named in the Kingsland Rovers third grade side along with another List though it is unknown who this was, possibly his older brother Percy. Claude would have been aged 18 at this time with Percy aged 22. His Kingsland side won the 3rd grade championship in this 1921. The following 1922 season he continued to play for their 3rd grade side who were runners up in the championship. He was listed as “C List”, while the other List in the team was “J List”. By 1923 Claude had moved into the Kingsland 2nd grade side.In 1924 he was still in the 2nd grade side and was playing on the wing. His Kingsland side won the 2nd grade knockout competition when they beat Otahuhu Rovers on October 18. Earlier in the season he had played for Kingsland against the Devonport United 2nd grade side as curtain-raiser to the New Zealand v England test match at Carlaw Park.List was selected for the Auckland Junior representative side to play Hamilton juniors in a match at Carlaw Park on August 30. He played on the wing with the Auckland side winning the match 14 to 8. He was chosen for the same side to play Hamilton once more on October 4. This time the match was played at Steele Park in Hamilton and Auckland won 17 to 8 with List on the wing again. He scored one of Auckland\\'s 5 tries. Senior debut and Auckland representative selection. The 1925 season was to be a remarkable one for List. He made his senior debut for Kingsland who had been promoted to the newly formed B Division in Auckland club rugby league. And he became one of the only players to gain selection for Auckland from that grade, a feat he beat in 1928 when he became the first ever player in New Zealand to be selected for the national side from effectively a second division side. His first appearance was in Kingsland\\'s opening round match on April 18 against Northcote & Birkenhead Rambers in an early match at Carlaw Park. He scored 3 tries in a 21–3 win. List opened the scoring and then early in the second half was “prominent in a fine passing bout, and dived over in the corner”, then minutes later he “broke away after a scrum and scored his third try”. He scored 3 more tries in their 13 all draw with Māngere United in round 3 on Peter Moko Farm in Māngere. In their next match with Otahuhu Rovers on May 23. He “made several breaks only to be pulled up by smart tackling” in a 16–3 loss. He then scored another try in a 8–5 loss to Northcote. Following a 9–5 loss to Ellerslie United the New Zealand Herald said List “was responsible for several particularly fine solo efforts”. While in further comments on the match the following day they said “List, for Kingsland, is a clever player, who usually scores the most number of points for his side”.Following a match with Mangere and then a bye, an Auckland trial side was selected between A and B teams. The match was a curtain-raiser to the North Island v South Island match at Carlaw Park on June 27. List was selected in the three quarters of the B team by selectors Edward Fox, Albert Asher, and Ronald McDonald. He played well in a 5–0 win to his side. In the first half he saved a try after a break by Roy Hardgrave and later made a break with a run down the sideline and centred a kick which was saved by Charles Gregory. List again saved the B side when Hardgrave had made a “clever dribbling movement”. The New Zealand Herald said during the week that “playing for the B team, List, the Kingsland player, showed up as a fine wing-three quarter. He has a good turn of speed and was the best of the B team’s backs”.The match along with the inter-island game and an Auckland v South Auckland (Waikato) match were part of the trials to select the New Zealand side to tour Australia. Despite being a newcomer to the senior game the Auckland Star said that he was a little unlucky to not make the tour. List was chosen as a reserve for the Auckland side to play New Zealand on July 2 prior to their departure but did not take the field.He then returned to his Kingsland side for 3 more club matches. The New Zealand Herald said that he was one of the players who had shown “particularly fine form” and was a young player who was in the frame for selection for Auckland\\'s Southern Tour later in the season. After one further match for Kingsland on July 25 and following a bye he was named as an emergency player for Auckland\\'s match with South Auckland (Waikato) on August 19. Following Kingsland\\'s loss to Otahuhu in the Stallard Cup, List was selected in the Auckland touring side. It was stated that he was 22 years old and weighed 12 stone.With the New Zealand side on tour with a large number of Auckland players, the Auckland team was officially a B side with several young players aged 19 to 22. Their first match was against West Coast at Greymouth on the West Coast on September 9. Auckland B won the match 22 to 15 with List scoring a try. His try came in the second half after “passing by Tim Peckham, Hector Cole, and Ben Davidson enabled List to score” in a tackle. He was then named in the match against Canterbury. Auckland B lost the match 6 points to 5 at Monica Park in Christchurch before a crowd of 2,500. List did not feature prominently in the match reports though was said to have “staged a useful dash down the far line”. He was chosen again for their final tour match against Wellington on September 16. Auckland thrashed the local side at Newtown Park in Wellington by 68 points to 9. List scored a try in the win. He combined with Ben Davidson to put Davidson in for a try to make the score 16–4. Then a while later Balks miskicked into List\\'s hands and he was able to score easily under the posts with the conversion giving his side a 23–4 lead.After their last tour match List was chosen in the full Auckland side to play South Auckland on September 19. In his full Auckland debut he scored 2 tries in a 36–19 win at Carlaw Park. He played on the wing with Ben Davidson at centre with Leonard Riley and Hector Cole in the five eight positions. In the first half he “essayed a side dash down the line but was well grassed by Smith when near the corner flag”. Then later in the half he “again tried to penetrate the strong defense and after dribbling, picked up the ball, threw across to Arthur Singe, who scored a good try”. In the second half he was involved in a try to Davidson after he sprinted down the side line and in passed to a supporting Davidson, then a while later the two combined again but this time List scored in the corner. Later in the match “Horace Dixon thrust his way past several players and passed to Hector Cole, to Riley, who made the opening for List to again dash over near the corner”. The Auckland Star said that “List fully justified his inclusion, and gave a brilliant exhibition” though the Herald noted that he had “started badly, but in the second spell gave a good exhibition”. List was chosen as a reserve for the Auckland Province match against the touring Queensland side on October 10 with Johnston of South Auckland and Frank Delgrosso preferred on the wings. The Auckland Province side was thrashed 54-14 and during the match Auckland fullback Stan Raynor left the field but instead of being replaced by List he was replaced by Bill Te Whata. The Herald expressed surprise and said “when Raynor was hurt just before the interval there was considerable surprise when Te Whata, the reserve forward went on to the wing instead of List, the chosen reserve back… This is surely an injustice to the Kingsland player who was ready on the line. The action of the selectors cannot be commended and it is to be hoped that the New Zealand Council will ask for an explanation for a dangerous precedent has been set”.The 1926 season saw List play 16 matches for Kingsland scoring 11 tries and kicking a goal. He made 4 appearances for Auckland scoring 7 tries, being their equal leading try scorer along with George Wade. He also played in a New Zealand trial match scoring a try.. At the start of the year he was elected on to the Kingsland club committee. In their first game of the season against Otahuhu he scored all Kingsland\\'s points with a try which he converted in a 6–5 loss. He was in his customary position on the wing. He “scored a fine try after Herring and McManus had made the opening”. He scored further tries in a round 3 loss to Northcote where he was said to be “prominent” and a round 5 win over Parnell. His try against Parnell came when he got away and struggled across the line with “two or three men clinging to him”. He was then involved in their next try after a passing movement with Herring. His 4th try of the season came on June 19 in a 19–2 win over eventual champions Northcote. The Auckland Star said that “List was … putting in great work… [and] a brilliant try was scored when List went across under the posts after the ball had passed through five players’ hands”.List was then named as a reserve for a New Zealand trial match at Carlaw Park. It was a curtain-raiser for the North Island v South Island clash and part of a program of representative games to help the New Zealand selectors chose their squad to tour England and Wales. He was then chosen in a B Team trial side to play on July 10 with a Probables – Possibles match played after it. The Auckland Star mentioned that “all the best players will be fielded tomorrow, and the appearance of List (Kingsland) in the B team will please hundreds of followers of the game, who hold he is as good a three-quarter as can be found in Auckland. It will be interesting to see how he shapes tomorrow”. List\\'s B Team won 30 points to 28. He scored one of their tries and was said to be one of their “outstanding” backs along with George Wade and Stan Prentice. List missed selection for the New Zealand touring side with the Herald speculating that Jim Parkes “is a weak link, and the inclusion of List would have been preferable”.After 2 more matches for Kingsland in which he scored a try in their round 10 win over Parnell he was selected for the Auckland side to play the New Zealand team before they left. He was picked for the wing but when centre Leonard Riley was unable to play List was moved to centre. Auckland won the match which had a festival type style by 52 points to 32 with List scoring a try. There were 14,000 in attendance at Carlaw Park for the match. He was involved in Maurice Wetherill’s try which opened the scoring. He later ran “half the length of the field and when overtaken by Craddock Dufty threw in for Horace Dixon to pick up and score”. His try came after a break by Tim Peckham who got the ball to Stan Prentice who passed to List “who beat [Craddock] Dufty with a clever swerve and scored”. The Herald saying he “deserved his selection”.The Auckland Star made several criticisms of the New Zealand side chosen to tour, especially in the backs. Saying that “[Ivan] Littlewood, Hickey, and List are, to put it mildly, very unfortunate in not going on tour”. Ironically it was the forwards that turned out to be more of an issue with 8 of them refusing to play after a falling out with coach Mair resulting in several backs having to play in the forwards and the offending players later banned for life.List was then selected for the Auckland squad to train to play Otago on August 7 at Carlaw Park. He played well on the wing, scoring a try in a 14–4 win. His try gave Auckland a 5–2 lead after he received a pass from Payne and scored in the corner. List along with Prentice were said to have “handled the greasy ball in fine style” during the match.The Auckland Star once again made note of List being unlucky to have not made the New Zealand side saying “List has by now convinced everybody of the quality of his play, also of the fact that all the good players in Auckland are not in the A grade competition”. Returning to his Kingsland side he scored 4 tries in a 24–0 win over Otahuhu Rovers at the Auckland Domain on August 14. A week later in a 21–8 win over Māngere United he scored 2 more tries and set up another for Carter.Following the match he was named in the 19 man Auckland squad to play Canterbury. He made the final thirteen, playing in the centres in a 33–15 win at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 7,000. He threw the final pass for Wade\\'s try, Auckland\\'s second. Then “at midfield List shot through a gap with Wade trailing in support. The centre drew Canterbury’s last line of defence, and then sent Wade across wide out” once more. Early in the second half he took a pass from Prentice and “accelerated the pace of the movement, and although hard pressed, got over at the flag with a couple of Canterbury backs clutching at him”. Then later in the match “a long kick saw List and Blazey have a great race for possession, the Aucklander winning by a touch”. The Herald said during the following week that “List was the outstanding back on the Auckland side, and his straight running and strong fending were very impressive. Coached on the right lines in the value of co-operating more with the wings, List will develop into a brilliant attacking centre three-quarter”.List returned to the Kingsland side for their match with Northcote. The 2 teams were leading the B Division competition with 2 matches remaining with Northcote holding a 1-point lead. Northcote won to seal the championship with Kingsland finishing runner up. The Herald said that “some good talent was hidden in the ranks of the B section teams. The ability of List, of Kingsland was cited, and it was contended that other players of equal merit only awaited a chance to make good”.List was then chosen for the Auckland side to play South Auckland side from the Waikato on October 9. Auckland won 25 to 8 before a small crowd of 3,000 at Carlaw Park. List scored 3 tries, the first coming after Allan Seagar dummied past opponents and “then passed to List, trailing in support, for the Kingsland centre to sail in unopposed”. A cross-kick by List then gave Wade on the wing a chance through his speed to gain possession and score under the posts. A while later Cleaver “gave a high reverse pass, and List, gathering the ball on the tips of his fingers, put the seal on a splendid bit of collaboration by diving across wide out”. Then with still time remaining in the first half he “made a great opening and sailed for the line with Cleaver and Seagar in support. Paki made a game effort to stop the raid, but the ball was sent on for Seagar to score a good try”. In the second half a passing movement saw List get the ball from Seagar and “racing on a diagonal line [he] crossed to score wide out”. The Herald said that “List was perhaps the best of the [Auckland] three-quarters, and his straight running made his play very impressive”.List then returned to his Kingsland side for their Stallard Cup knockout final match against Parnell on October 16. Kingsland won by 25 points to 13. List set up a try to Carter and “was playing a fine game for Kingsland… [he then] made a clever opening and again Carter scored”. 1927 North Island selection. The 1927 season saw List play 13 matches for Kingsland Rovers scoring 2 tries, although the B Division matches did not receive very good newspaper coverage so he may have scored more. Kingsland once again finished runner up, this time behind Ellerslie United. He played 5 games for Auckland, scoring 7 tries which was the most for the representative side. List also made his debut appearance for the North Island representative side.. His season began early, being selected on April 12 to go into training for the Auckland side to play the returning Auckland members of the New Zealand team from their England and Wales tour. The match was played at Carlaw Park on April 30 with the Auckland side winning 24-21 before a crowd of 14,000. List scored a try and the Auckland Star stated that “List, the Auckland centre was very brilliant in attack and his sharp burst of speed, allied to straight running, often penetrated deeply into the New Zealand defense. On the day he showed to greater advantage than B. Davidson…”. He “had every opportunity to do well, and his straight running and delightful swerving were good to watch”.This was the only representative match played by Auckland until near the end of the club season. List played 13 games for Kingsland from May 14 to September 3. In their second match which they won 11–3 against Otahuhu at the Otahuhu Trotting Ground he “gave another splendid exhibition, and he will give Davidson a good fight for the centre three-quarter position in the rep. team”. In their team list for their match against Mangere on May 28, Claude\\'s younger brother Francis was also listed in the side with him. Following a 25–0 win over Otahuhu on July 9 the Auckland Star said “the best of the backs was without doubt List at centre. He was always there to seize an opportunity, and also put in some solid defence work. He is about the best three-quarter Auckland has playing league”. On August 13 List scored Kingsland\\'s only points in what amounted to the B Division final which was played against top of the table Ellerslie United side. Ellerslie won 9 to 3 at Carlaw Park on the number 2 field with around 7,000 spectators at the venue. After the match the Star wrote that “List of the Kingsland team, is probably the best centre three-quarter in Auckland and both he and Littlewood, of Ellerslie, had strong claims for inclusion in the last New Zealand team that toured England”.Following a match against Parnell, List was named in an eighteen player squad to tour south for Auckland. The Auckland Star compared his play to that of Craddock Dufty, a superstar of the game at the time, “Dufty and List are the two best centres in sight, although their methods are dissimilar. List is the better type of centre, straight running, unselfish, and clever at catering for his wings. Dufty is a better fullback than a centre, although this season he has consistently been in the three-quarter line”. The side was then amended with some players unable to go but the backs chosen were Charles Gregory, Craddock Dufty]], Little, List, Joe Wilson jun., Maurice Wetherill, Stan Prentice, and Stan Webb. List played in the first match of the tour against Canterbury at Monica Park in Christchurch before a crowd of 3,000. Auckland won 24 to 13 with List scoring a try. He played on the wing with Gregory playing out of position at centre to accommodate Dufty who played at fullback. The Christchurch Press said that he “is a very determined runner with a gift of getting past tacklers”. During the second half Dufty fielded a kick and set his teammates off “for List to evade tacklers, and score in good position”. List scored again in their next tour match which was at Victoria Park in Greymouth, on the West Coast. Their opponents were a combined West Coast/Buller side and Auckland won easily by 42 points to 15 before 1,000 spectators. The local newspaper, the Grey River Argus said that “Prentice, Wetherill and List made hacks of our insiders”. List was involved in Auckland\\'s first try to Wilson, and then another in the second half to Little then later he nearly put Little in again but instead gained the loose ball after some “very weak tackling” near the line. List was then named in the reserves for the match against Otago, while it appears he did not play in the final match of the tour against Wellington. A full team list was played but there were 7 backs named in the match report and he was not among them.. List was then selected to play in his first ever match for the North Island side to play the South Island. It was commented that “List has proved his claim for a place in big football, and if a New Zealand side were picked this season would probably be sure of a place”. List was chosen to play on the wing, with Stan Raynor on the other wing, Maurice Wetherill at centre, and Dufty at fullback. The North Island won the match at Carlaw Park by 13 points to 8 with List scoring a first half try. It came when “Gregory beat at least six opponents with a dazzling run that ended in List racing between the posts”. Dufty\\'s conversion gave the North Island an 8–3 lead. Later in the half he made “a determined effort to get over, only to be forced into touch by Blackaby”. In the second half he saved a try when “Goodall accepted a pass and he raced for the line, only to be overtaken by List inches from the line”. Towards the end of the game he was involved again and “proved a hard man to stop, the B section representative ran strongly for the corner. Pressed by Sullivan he passed to Prentice, who knocked the ball on”.On October 8 List was a part of the Auckland side to play Buller at Carlaw Park. He scored 3 tries in an easy 60–33 victory. Early in the match he “made a brilliant opening, and Wilson’s pace carried him over between the posts for Dufty to goal”. There was little detailed description of List\\'s three tries as there were so many the newspapers could only be brief. It was later said that “List was too strong for the opposing centre, and his straight running played havoc with the defence”.List and Auckland\\'s final match of the season was against South Auckland (Waikato) on October 15. Once again he scored a try however this time Auckland was defeated in a shock upset 29 points to 12 at Carlaw Park. In regards to the Auckland backs it was said “of the seven, List was the most convincing for all round play”. The Auckland Star said “of the Auckland backs Wetherill and List were the only two who were really impressive”. Though the Herald said that he “spoiled a good display by retaining possession after he had raced the wings into scoring positions”. 1928 New Zealand debut. List once again began the season playing for Kingsland. There was very little coverage of their matches in the B Division. He played in 11 of their games but it is unknown if he scored any tries. After their opening round 8–5 defeat by Mangere United on May 5 it was said that “List was the pick of Kingsland’s backs and the Auckland representative is in good form for the big matches ahead. He has only to retain his form of last season to be one of the big successes against the English team”. Then after a round 5 win over Northcote on May 26 by 9 points to 5 the Star said that “List and Carter were in good form and the pair treated the spectators to some fine football. It was really the good work of these two players that beat Northcote”. The following week in a game against Otahuhu on June 2 he injured his knee but played on and it was said that “the crack played a great game on defence, saving his side on numerous occasions” in their 8–3 victory.The Auckland Star in commenting on representative possibilities said that “for centre three-quarter there are two players of real class in List and Beattie”. A week later against Parnell in a 19–10 win “List was a tower of strength for the winner, his straight, powerful running being a factor in Kingsland’s success”.. List was then selected in the Auckland side to play South Auckland in their opening representative match of the season on June 16. He was originally chosen for the wing with Len Scott on the other wing and Allan Seagar at centre. But the match day side was adjusted and he played at centre with Scott and Roy Hardgrave on the wings with Seagar moving into the five eighths with Stan Prentice. He scored 2 tries in their 22–3 win at Carlaw Park. His first try came after the entire back line had handled the ball aside from Scott and List went in for “an easy try”. Later in the half “pretty in and out passing by the backs and forwards saw List score the best try of the game”. The Herald said List was “a player who caught the eye. He played centre three-quarter and received some bad passes on occasions which he gathered with the ability of a finished player. His strong running was a feature”.He returned to the Kingsland side who beat Mangere on June 30 by 6 points to 3. The Kingsland halves played well and “List was given every chance to operate his splendid swerve. The Auckland rep., was well marked but he was Kingsland’s best back”. Against Grafton on July 7 in their 8–3 loss he “made some clever openings and was the best back on the ground”.List was then selected in an Auckland Possibles side to play in an Auckland trial. The selectors (Edward Fox, Bert Avery, and Ernie Asher were looking to find the best possible side to play against the England side when was touring shortly after. His Possibles side won 24-14 and he scored a try in the win. It was said that “the wing three-quarters honours were fairly well divided between Hardgrave, List, and L. Scott… List played solidly and well..” The Herald said that he was “easily the best of the wings”. His try came after Alf Scott got the ball to Hec Brisbane who passed to List “the wing racing over near the corner”. He was then involved in a try to Maurice Wetherill after List “carried it to a few yards from the line” after a passing bout was started by Frank Delgrosso. He next played for Kingsland against Point Chevalier on July 14 in a 19–8 win. “List’s strong running and deadly fend was the turning point in Kingsland’s favour, and twice the Auckland rep. paved the way for Simms to score. List must be taken hard and low, otherwise the big centre is liable to score tries in the best company”.. List was then selected to play for Auckland against Canterbury on July 21 at Carlaw Park. He played on the wing with Maurice Wetherill at centre. Auckland won easily 66 to 26 with List scoring twice. Early in the match he “ran strongly on the right wing and when cornered passed to Prentice to go across wide out”. Later in the half he repeated the effort with the same result. His first try came in the second half after a “passing run, he wandered across near the posts”. Then he “made a dash on the right wing. He passed to Jim O\\'Brien who returned it, and allowed the Kingsland man to score as he liked”. The Auckland Star said that “both List and Hardgrave having the time of their lives yet for the games ahead Wetherill would be better placed at second five eighths and List at centre three-quarter, for good though the latter is on the flank, he is greater inside”. The Herald did note however that “List did not put his usual dash into his running and would be well advised to refrain from “Hurdling” an opponent. Although his effort in jumping over the Canterbury fullback was spectacular, the practice is a most dangerous one”. List was selected to play for Auckland against South Auckland on July 25 at centre. He scored a try in Auckland\\'s 19–17 loss but was said to have “failed badly at centre”. Late in the match with Auckland ahead 17-16 he “passed infield to Dixon when Scott was unmarked”. List was only named as an emergency for the North Island side to play the South Island on July 28. He was however named on the wing for the Possibles in the New Zealand trial match to be played midweek on August 1. List\\'s Possibles side lost 27–24. In the first half he “raced away from a passing bout, and Longville scored”.List was then chosen by Edward Fox, W.J. Mitchell, and W Murray, for the New Zealand side to make his national debut in the first test against England on August 4 at Carlaw Park. He thus became the first ever player to gain selection for New Zealand whilst playing for a second division club. He was named in the centres with Roy Hardgrave and Len Scott on the wings, Craddock Dufty at fullback, and Maurice Wetherill and Stan Prentice in the five eighth positions, and Frank Delgrosso at halfback. An all Auckland backline. The Herald said that “List was certainly very fortunate to gain the centre position”.. New Zealand won the match 17-13 causing a great upset in front of a crowd estimated at well over 20,000. List scored a try in the win. While New Zealand used the two five eighths system the English played 2 centres and had a solitary five eighth. Their centres opposite List and Wetherill were Jim Brough and Joe Oliver. England had just toured Australia where they won the test series 2–1. With the score 4–0 to New Zealand early in the match “List came into prominence with a good run. He placed a punt nicely and L. Scott beat Askin and Sullivan in a follow through, but the ball went over the dead line”. Then with the score 4–3 to New Zealand, England were penalised under their posts. Instead of kicking for goal “Wetherill took the ball, baffled the Englishmen by kicking across to the left flank, where List ran through, gathered the ball cleanly and dived through a tackle to score” with Delgrosso converting the try. With New Zealand leading 11–3 in the second half Wetherill caught the ball standing still “but swept a very wide pass to List. The latter raced on a diagonal line and whipped the ball on to Len Scott. Amid a scene of great excitement, Scott tossed back his head and ran for the corner flag. Askin put in a flying low tackle, but the Shore man kept his feet and amid delirious excitement went across wide out. In comments after the match it was said that “List played to form in the New Zealand centre, and made one of the tries that came New Zealand’s way. The English centres, on the other hand, comparatively failed”. The Herald said that “List played a sound all-round game at centre”.List was then selected for the Auckland Provincial side to play England 4 days later. He was in the centres, opposite Mel Rosser. The Auckland Provincial side, made up of 12 Auckland club players lost to England 14–9 in front of 15,000 spectators. The Star said “in a subdued light List did well”. He was involved in his side\\'s first try when Hanlon cut in and passed to List who “ran to the fullback (Gowers) and sent L. Scott over for a fine try”.  The Star noted that he “did not handle as well as usual, but was clearly hampered by the failure of the inside men [Hanlon and Amos]”. List was then chosen for the Auckland side to play England on August 11. The side was very similar to the test team with 12 of the 13 players New Zealand representatives at various points. Auckland lost the match 26–15 with 25,000 in attendance at Carlaw Park. List played opposite Jim Brough and Les Fairclough on the English side. Early in the match Frank Delgrosso “worked the blind side from a scrum. List came into the movement and passed to Hardgrave. The fleet Auckland wing short-punted over Sullivan’s head and regained possession to touch down for a fine try amid tremendous excitement”. Later List intercepted a pass and cleared when England were attacking through Bryn Evans, Billo Rees, and Brough.List was named as part of a larger three quarter group to play in the second test with one to be omitted. The players were Len Scott, Hec Brisbane, List, and Roy Hardgrave. List was the one who ultimately missed selection and had even been named as a possible starter on match day which was at Caledonian Park in Dunedin. New Zealand lost the match 13 to 5. He was only bracketed for the 3rd test in Christchurch as well and did not make the side with Brisbane, Scott, and Hardgrave chosen. It was not reported why he did not get selected though it is probably that he had an injury. On September 8 in a match for Kingsland against Otahuhu it was said that “List was not in a fit condition to do himself justice, as the New Zealand rep. is still suffering from an injured leg. He nevertheless shone in patches”. He only needed to play half the game however as the match was called off by the referee at halftime due to the behaviour of the Otahuhu players and spectators with Kingsland leading 8 to 5.List had recovered enough to be named in the Auckland  squad against Otago the following weekend on September 15. He ultimately played and Auckland won 42–22. He was involved in Auckland\\'s second try when “the ball went from Delgrosso to Brisbane, to List. The Kingsland centre brought his wing perfectly into position and then swung the pass to send Hardgrave galloping across”. Soon after he was involved in another passing bouth with Brisbane and Hardgrave before Brisbane scored. His final game for Kingsland came in their Stallard Cup semi final 18–10 defeat to Grafton Athletic on September 22. It was reported perhaps rather harshly that “List failed to make an impression. The New Zealand rep. depended upon his fend to make openings. He has no variety for a centre three-quarter”.On October 1 List was selected in the Auckland side to play North Auckland (Northland) on October 6 in Whangārei. Auckland won the match, played at Kensington Park by 33 points to 9. List scored the opening try after a “handling bout”. He was then involved in a second half try to Jenkinson after List had made “an opening”. Kingsland Athletic and Auckland (1929-30). At the start of the 1929 season List\\'s Kingsland Rovers club merged with Grafton Athletic in an endeavour to be admitted into the first grade competition. Their colours were maroon (Kingsland\\'s colours), with a blue and gold shield and they would be known as Kingsland Athletic. This would be the first time List had played in the first grade in his fifth season of senior rugby league. In an article about the merger the Auckland Star featured a portrait photo of List, although they erroneously said that the Grafton Athletic club (originally named Maritime) was the original Grafton Athletic which had ceased in 1922.List played 15 matches for Kingsland and scored 7 tries and kicking a drop goal and played 3 matches for Auckland, scoring 2 tries. He scored a try in a practice match against Northcote on April 20 before Kingsland\\'s opening match in first grade against City Rovers at Carlaw Park on April 27. Kingsland lost the match 21–6 with List scoring one of their two tries. The Herald said that “List was below form and passed wildly at times”. Against Devonport a week later at the Devonport Domain he “received the ball only on rare occasions, but gave a great defensive display” in a 29–7 loss. They lost to Newton 12–10 with List setting up R. Carter for a try. He “played well” in the match. Kingsland then secured their first championship point with a 18–18 draw against Marist Old Boys. List was the best of their backs along with Christmas and Angelo. Though the Auckland Star said “List, at centre, played wonderfully in the circumstances and appears to be striking good form”. In a heavy loss to Ponsonby List “got through an immeasurable amount of good work”. He then scored 2 tries in Kingsland\\'s first win, by 17 points to 5 over Ellerslie. The Star said he was “outstanding, [and] played sufficiently deeply to be able to race up effectively and co-operate with Angelo and Nasey”. And that his second try “was a gem, a solo effort in swerving brilliance by which he cut out three defenders and the full-back”. He scored another try in a 13–8 loss to City though “lacked opportunities” but still played a great defensive game towards the end. The Herald criticised his play saying “List at centre three-quarter, is certainly a powerful runner, but it is surprising to see a player of his experience hold on to the ball after an opportunity is presented to the wing. Had List passed more often Kingsland may have won comfortably”. Against Devonport the following week he set up both of Kingsland\\'s tries in an 18–8 loss.They then had their second win, 14–10 over Newton on June 29. He was “perhaps the best of the Kingsland backs, his powerful running paving the way for two tries”. He \"had little difficulty in beating [Cyril] Brimble, whose defence was weak. The Kingsland centre played his best game this season but will find it difficult to obtain a place as centre in the representative team. With good inside backs List, as a wing, is one of the most dangerous scoring backs in the code”. He scored another try in their 25–10 loss to Marist, and played “like a rock” in a 9–0 defeat to Ponsonby.Then with Auckland representative selection looming List played a great game against Richmond with Kingsland winning 6–0. He scored after he “had taken the ball at his feet, from halfway, and just beat Grace in a spectacular dive”. He “played a sound game. His powerful running paved the way for both Kingsland’s tries”.List was then selected for Auckland to play against South Auckland on July 27. Auckland won 11–8 with List overshadowing his opposite, Jackways. He “was at his best in the first half, and his defensive play was excellent”. He set up Len Scott’s try after he fielded a high kick “splendidly”. Though the Herald said he “was not impressive at centre, throwing many wild passes to Scott and Mincham”. Returning to the Kingsland side List kicked a drop goal in a 19–7 win over Ellerslie. It was said “List’s play was a feature of the afternoon. He was always in the thick of play, his cutting in being brilliant, while he paved the way for two of Kingsland’s tries”.He was then picked in the Auckland Auckland training squad to prepare for a match against Northland before being chosen on the wing. He scored a try in Auckland\\'s 22–19 win. “Carter and List, played brightly with limited opportunity and were conspicuous for determined dashes”. The Herald said that he “kicked altogether too much to be impressive. The Kingsland wing would be a good scoring player if he had confidence in his undoubted pace and strength”. He was chosen in the 22 man Auckland training squad to prepare for their match against Canterbury on August 24. He was ultimately picked in the side to play on the wing. Auckland won 47-18 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park with List scoring the home side\\'s final try. The Herald said that “List showed more determination than in other matches and played really well”. His final match of the season was for Kingsland when they were eliminated in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition 9-3 by Marist. He “combined well in the three-quarter line [with Carter] and they were repeatedly conspicuous for strong running”. He failed to make the North Island side to play the South Island a week later.. The 1930 season saw List play 14 matches for Kingsland Athletic, and once again he scored 7 tries for them. This placed him equal ninth in the club try scoring list. He only played one match for Auckland out of their three matches. Prior to the start of the season in team previews the Auckland Star said “List is a steady and resolute exponent with plenty of experience”. Kingsland lost their opening game to Marist 16-13 but were awarded the victory as Marist had fielded an unregistered player. List was involved in much of Kingsland\\'s attacking work. After their round 2 loss to Devonport List was selected in the 23 man training squad for Auckland\\'s match with Northland. He then played for Kingsland against Newton on May 10 in a 14–8 loss. The Sun said that he “was on form, and his deadly fend proved a regular nightmare to some members of the opposition, but he failed to run straight, and gave his wingers insufficient room in which to work”.. List was then named on the wing for Auckland for their May 17 match with Northland. Auckland won the match 21-16 before a crowd of 8,000 at Carlaw Park. List had a rare poor game and “a weak attempt at tackling by him let Whitelaw, the visitor’s right winger, run rings around him”, resulting in a try to Dunn. The Auckland Star said “List by no means justified his selection”, he “was uncertain in his movements, dropped passes all to frequently, and did not prove a match for his vis-a-vis, Whitelaw”. The Sun said “neither List nor R. Carter was very impressive. List seemed to be right off his game. He has been so long at centre that he appeared to be at a loss to know what to do on the wing”.He was \"again disappointing\" in Kingsland\\'s next match with Richmond on May 24. He “mishandled at times, but was given few real chances”. The New Zealand side was touring Australia later in the season so his poor form was relevant for further rep honours in 1930. He was then omitted from the Auckland side to play South Auckland on May 31 after having been named in a 20-man squad to train prior.List spent the remainder of the season in the maroon jersey of Kingsland. The following week he scored a try in a 31–10 loss to Ellerslie where he played well but had few opportunities. His play then turned around in a narrow 17–13 loss to City. He “struck his best form and was a tower of strength to his side. It was about his best exhibition this season”. Both he and Carter were “outstanding and were responsible to no mean extent for the showing made by their side”. List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13–6 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was “easily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards”. He “at centre, was brilliant in patches”. List then scored two tries in Kingsland\\'s 13–5 win over Newton. He “gave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago”. The Sun said he “played a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday”. In a 18–16 loss to Ellerslie he scored a try and was involved with 2 others. His last two matches of the season came against City Rovers. The first was in an upset 14–13 win against the championship runners up. He scored two of their tries. He was “the pick of the three-quarters”. His final match was a week later in a Roope Rooster round one loss to the same opponent by 31 to 13. List joins Marist with Kingsland merger 1931. In 1931 Kingsland was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys. Auckland Rugby League felt that the senior grade had too many teams with 8 and that the competition was weaker than when it had 6 for the majority of the previous 2 decades and as a result was drawing smaller crowds. They also decdided to create a reserve grade competition. Kingsland were essentially facing losing their entire playing squad with relegation to a senior B grade so they instead chose to merge with Marist. With Marist able to draw on the best players from Kingsland they were suggested as the early favourites to win the competition. They already had a strong back line with 4 New Zealand representatives and it was said that List “is likely to play back row forward, a position to which he should easily accustom himself”.List scored a try on debut for his ‘new team’ in an 11–10 win over Richmond Rovers, though the game had gone for longer than it should have and Auckland Rugby League ordered it to be replayed at a later date. His try came 2 minutes after the bell should have been rung and gave Marist the ‘win’. It was “a characteristic hard dash and dive when there was little room to manoeuvre in”. He crossed the line “amid spectators”. Although it was also reported that “List, on the wing, was never prominent until he scored the winning try”. The following week in a 20–9 win over Ponsonby List scored another try and kicked a drop goal. He missed their next match through injury. In their round 7 win over Devonport by 11-4 he “repeatedly broke through”. Then in an 8–3 win over Richmond List scored another try and was said “to be profiting by the association” with New Zealand international Hec Brisbane in the back line. List scored 2 more tries in Marist\\'s 25–10 win over Ponsonby on July 4, and then the following week in a 17–9 win over Newton he impressed with his strong runs and he also kicked forcefully”. In an 18–10 win over City on July 18 it was said “List at centre was in good form, and took a power of stopping once in his stride. He gave his wingers plenty of room to work in, and sent Pat Meehan over for a try with a well timed pass. List’s handling has improved greatly since throwing in his lot with the greens, and he should go close to rep. honours this season”. The selection of the North Island team was approaching and the Herald said “[Pat] Meehan and List (Marist) have strong claims as wing three-quarters”.Marist then traveled to Wellington in their bye round to play a Wellington combined clubs side. Marist won 40–19 with List scoring one of their tries at Wellington Show Stadium. He scored another try on August 1 against the combined Ellerslie-Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]]. Their final round match against Devonport was to decide the title with the teams tied for first. Marist won 12–5 to claim the 1931 Fox Memorial championship. List “beat Seagar on three or four occasions” during the first half.List was then selected by Thomas McClymont to make his second appearance for North Island in their inter island match with the South Island. In some remarks by the Herald they said “List is playing in good form at present and deserves a place in the three-quarter line”. They also suggested he “has all the credentials of a fullback”. The North Island won at Carlaw Park by 52 points to 23. List scored 3 tries at centre, the first coming when he “fended his way through in fine style” before two more in the second half. He was playing opposite Jim Amos who “showed up at centre at times, but was no match for List”. He was said to have “played splendid football”. List also kicked a second half conversion and was involved in one of Meehan\\'s 4 tries and a try for Abbott. The Herald also said that “List was perhaps the best of the three-quarters. Powerful, straight running makes List a dangerous back”.List then played for Marist against a Lower Waikato side at Steele Park in Hamilton, before being defeated by Devonport in the Roope Rooster semi finals. He set up both Marist tries in their 11–8 loss. He was said to have been “the best back on the ground. His straight running on attack and strong fending paved the way for Marist’s two tries. With more of the ball List might easily have given Marist the victory”.That was to be his final game of the season after he suffered an injury. He missed the Stormont Shield final with Devonport which Marist lost. The Star said “it was evident that the losers sadly missed their thrustful and brilliant centre three-quarter, List, who was unable to appear owing to having an injured hand”. The Herald said that he had “an injured wrist and it is thought a bone has been broken”. He was still however named to practice for Auckland\\'s match against Northland but was ultimately unavailable to play. He also missed the combined Marist-Devonport sides match against the touring Eastern Suburbs from Sydney. New Zealand selection v England. The 1932 season was to be the most significant of List\\'s career. For Marist he scored 9 tries which was the most of any player in Auckland. While he also played in all 3 test matches for New Zealand against England. In addition he played for Auckland, an Auckland XIII, and the North Island once more. His season started with 10 matches for Marist which was the entire Fox Memorial first grade championship. Marist finished runner up, 4 points behind Devonport. In the 4th round match against Ponsonby on May 21 he scored 2 tries. He, “on the wing, was one of the best backs”. His second try came after following his own kick which gave Marist a 23–12 win. Against Devonport on May 28 in an 11–11 draw he was “easily the best Marist three-quarter. His straight running was a thorn in Devonport’s side”. In the New Zealand Herald on June 15 an article was written about some backs which could be chosen to play against England on their upcoming tour. They suggested that “backs capable of taking knocks which they will undoubtedly get when opposed by the Englishmen, are necessary. Brisbane, List, Davidson and Seagar are players who have set a high standard in tackling this season and are the type most likely to stop the swift and determined attacks of the visitors”. In another draw, against city, 13-13 List “played most brilliantly at centre in the first half, displaying great speed at times”. He “essayed several sparkling runs, in which he showed an elusive side-step. The City defence seemed reluctant to tackle low and the Marist three-quarter took advantage of this to exploit a powerful fend with good effect”. A week later in a 25–21 loss to Ponsonby “List was the star of the rear divisions, his vigorous straight running and clever moves paving the way for openings, exciting unstinted admiration”. List scored a try and was involved in two others, the second when he “raced 50 yards, and passed to McDonald” who scored. He “overshadowed” Brian Riley of Ponsonby, and “was easily Marist’s best back. His powerful running penetrated far into Ponsonby’s territory. The only blot on his play was an inclination to hold on when the wing could have improved the positions”.Following the end of the championship matches an Auckland XIII team was chosen to play against South Auckland on July 16 with List named in it on the wing. He scored 3 tries in the Auckland sides 29–13 win at Carlaw Park. List was involved in a good early piece of attacking play with Bert Cooke and also involved in their first try when he made a run on the side line and when “cramped for room” placed a centring kick for Brisbane to take it and pass it on to ‘Trevor Hall to score. He made another good run but was held up by Whorskey. Later in the first half Cooke put in List for his first try, then in the second half several backs were involved before List went in for the try, then he added a third later in the match as Auckland cleared out.Following the match List was named in the North Island side. The North Island won the game 27-18 with List scoring a try. His try came with the score 13-9 in their favour after “McIntyre, Brisbane, Cooke and List handled in turn, List who had seen little or nothing of the ball all day, taking a one-handed pass and racing over to score”. It was said that his “chances were restricted, he being starved in the first half, while in the second half he did not see a great deal of the ball, but when he did he made the best use of it”. First Test (Auckland, July 30). Following the inter-island match List was selected in a group of Auckland players to prepare for their match against England on August 6. Three days later he was named in the New Zealand team to play England in the first test, four years after he had made his test debut. He was chosen in the centres with Dick Smith and Len Scott on the wings, Albert Laing at fullback, and Hec Brisbane and Bert Cooke in the five eighth positions. List was matched up with Alf Ellaby and Artie Atkinson in the centres for England. New Zealand was outclassed in the match at Carlaw Park by 24 points to 9 in front of 25,000 spectators. Early in the match List was obstructed while England was on attack by Atkinson and New Zealand were awarded a free kick. The Star wrote after the match that “but for magnificent collaboration by Brisbane, Cooke and List, each of whom tackled with admirable tenacity, the visitors might have piled up scores, for neither our wingers nor the fullback were equal to the occasion”. Despite the New Zealand side struggling, List did enough to retain his place in the second test to be played at Monica Park in Christchurch.Prior to the second test List was selected to play for Auckland against the touring side on the wing. His weight was reported as 12 stone, making him the largest of the Auckland backs which had an average weight of 11st 3lb. List played on the wing opposite Stanley Smith. Auckland played well but lost 19-14 before a crowd of 15,000 at Carlaw Park on August 6. The Star said that “Cooke was always prominent, capably supported by Brisbane and List”. With England leading 3-0 early in the match a passing bout occurred “between Hassan and Davidson” before List received the ball with a chance to score but he was “thrown into touch”. During the second half with England leading 13-2 “a roar of delight went up when List, following up a long kick by Cooke, raced down the sideline. Davidson was on the inside to receive and score easily” “amid great excitement”. After this “Auckland’s rear guard was now making the play”, and List made a “dangerous plunge for the line” but just failed to score. The Herald wrote “Cooke again played a fine game, and Hassan, List and Davidson were also in good form”. Second Test (Christchurch, August 13). List then traveled with 10 other Aucklanders down to Christchurch to join the rest of the New Zealand squad for the second test. Changes were made to the New Zealand back line with Puti Tipene Watene named at fullback, List moved to the wing, Brisbane and Cooke in the centre positions, Ben Davidson on the other win, Wilf Hassan at five eighth, and Edwin Abbott at halfback. List was playing opposite English winger Stanley Smith once more. New Zealand lost 25 to 14 before 5,000 spectators. List scored both of New Zealand\\'s tries. Early in the match “Cooke, following up a New Zealand kick very fast, caught Sullivan with the ball. From the ensuing play, the ball was whipped out to Brisbane, who made a good opening. List topped off the movement with a good try in the corner”. Still in the first half with England leading 10-5 Abbot secured the ball, “made ground and passed to Hassan, the five eighths swung outwards, drew Sullivan and gave a well-timed pass to List, who clapped on the pace and dived across as he was tackled by Risman”. The try was converted by Jim Amos to level the score 10-10. With the score 25-14 late in the match “Cooke came close to sending List in on the right flank”. Third Test (Auckland, August 30). List was named in the New Zealand side to play the third test at Carlaw Park on August 20. List was once again on the right wing, opposite Barney Hudson. New Zealand lost the final test 20-18 after leading 18–17 with a minute to go before 12,000 spectators. List tackled well in the first half along with other New Zealand backs. At one stage he kicked well to get good field position and after New Zealand was awarded a penalty Watene kicked a goal to open the scoring. After the match the English financial manager, Mr. R.F. Anderton made several comments about the New Zealand side including saying that he was “impressed with Cooke, Brisbane and List. These players are worthy of inclusion in any international side”.With the English tour over List returned to his Marist side to finish the season. He played in their semi final win in the Roope Rooster over Devonport on September 3. He scored a try and his play along that of Schultz “was a feature of the match”. A week later Marist met City in the final and comfortably won 28–8 with List scoring a remarkable 4 tries. His first try came after Cornthwaite put him in under the posts, then Brisbane beat the defense and passed to List who scored again, then after a passing bout in the second half he got his third, before his last try late in the match after Webberley had made an error for City. Marist then met Devonport in the Stormont Shield final on September 17. Marist won their second trophy in as many weeks with a 15–8 win, with List scoring yet again.  On October 3 Marist travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki, going down 25–17. They then had a 37–8 win over Ponsonby in a Max Jaffe Cup charity match on October 8. List scored 2 tries and kicked 2 rare conversions. His final game of the season came in another charity match between Marist and a ‘rest of Auckland’ side on October 17. He score 2 more tries in Marist\\'s 27–16 win. Continuation of Marist and Auckland. In 1933 List played 21 matches for Marist and scored 6 tries and kicked 1 conversion. He also played 3 matches for Auckland and scored a try. These were to be the final representative matches of his career despite playing senior club football for a further 9 seasons. List was aged 30 by this point of his career. Following a 3rd round win over Ponsonby it was said that “List, at centre, was weak, dropping many passes, while also giving poor transfers”. The following week against Newton in an 11–6 win he “played a very solid game, and his only fault, if any, was that he did no give L. Schultz the opportunities the winger might have expected”. He “played his best game this season, handling the ball well, while his strong running was reminiscent of the player of past seasons”. then in a loss to City on June 3 he was said to be the best back along with Wilf Hassan for Marist.. List was then selected for Auckland’s first representative match of the season against Taranaki. The New Zealand Herald was blunt with their assessment saying “List, Marist, seems to have lost all form and is lucky to gain a place. Last season the marist centre was an outstanding success against the Englishmen. It is evident the selectors are relying upon past form”. He was picked at centre with Bill Turei and Roy Bright on the wings, with Albert Laing at fullback. Auckland won the match 32–20 at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 10,000. List was said to have not given Turei good passes and “was inclined to go too far before getting rid of the ball, but he was solid in defence”. The Herald said it was List\\'s “best game this season”.. In a 35–9 win over Devonport for Marist on June 17 List scored 3 tries and kicked a conversion. The Star said “for the first time this season List was well in the firing line, proving to some of his critics that he has the quality of a good centre. Two of his tries were the best he has produced for quite a long time”. Then a week later in a win over Ponsonby he scored 2 more tries and “gave a good display, right up to his best form”.In mid June List was selected for Auckland\\'s second match of the season when they played South Auckland on July 15. South Auckland caused an upset, winning 14–0. The “Auckland backs made desperate efforts in the fading stages to get some satisfaction, and in this Brisbane, List and Len Schultz featured, but it was all in vain” in muddy conditions. He then returned to the Marist side and scored a try in a win over Ponsonby on July 29. Marist had finished runner up in the championship to Devonport, and then finished runner up to Newton in the Challenge Cup competition played over 5 rounds. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the “best of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football”.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke\\'s Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List\\'s feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime “Hassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide” to give Auckland a 9–2 lead. The Auckland Star said “List did well when he came on for wing duty”. List had played in the curtain-raiser for Marist against Devonport in a challenge cup competition match and so ended up playing over 3 halves of football.Following a match against Ponsonby the Marist side played against the touring St. George side from Sydney who had finished runner up in the 1933 New South Wales rugby league competition. Before a crowd of 13,000 at Carlaw Park Marist won 25 to 11. List played on the wing and marked Len Brennan who was later killed in World War 2 aged just 32. He then finished the season with a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond and an unemployed charity match against the same opposition on October 21 as New Zealand was in the midst of the Great Depression. Falling out with Marist and transfer to Mount Albert. The 1934 was an unusual one for List. He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end. At the start of the season it was reported that he was available to play again but he was not named in their early season matches. Early in the season Marist were struggling for players with some playing for their reserve grade side and the senior side on the same day. List then came out of ‘retirement’ and had his season debut in their round 3 match against City Rovers on the same day the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park. They lost 18-5 and List was said to be “far from his best, judging by this exhibition”. He played better against Devonport a week later and scored a try in a 22–13 loss to Newton on May 26. However it was reported that he “played listlessly, his one real sparkle being the opportune try he obtained before the final whistle” on the left wing.It was then reported that there were several senior players at Marist who were in a dispute with the club over financial issues. They included C. Dunne, Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Wilf Hassan, brothers Len, Bill and John Schultz, and List. The club released an official statement on June 8 saying “that several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors…Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance…”. The eight players were then asked to appear at the club\\'s executive meeting the following week.List was named in the reserves for a match on June 9 but did not play, and then most of the players were suspended by the Marist club. The Auckland Rugby League had declared that the suspensions were “out of order” but the Marist club appealed to New Zealand Rugby League and they upheld the suspensions. List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan. Mt Albert had been seeking senior grade status and they were allowed to enter a team in the Roope Rooster along with the Papakura club. Mount Albert lost the match 19–11 to Ponsonby on Carlaw Park #2 field on August 18. List “at centre performed well apart from faulty handling on one or two occasions”.The 1935 season saw List play the entire season for Mount Albert, playing 15 games and scoring 4 tries, and kicking 1 conversion. He was now aged 32 and moved into the forwards, playing lock in their opening match against City on April 27. The following week against Richmond in a 27–15 loss his tackling was mentioned along with other forwards. They then had a high scoring 22–22 draw with Newton on May 11. For Mount Albert in a “hard working pack Flanagan, Gunning, Shiro and List were frequently prominent and were always dangerous when handling the ball”. After 3 further matches he then scored his first points for Mount Albert in a 27–14 win over City Rovers on June 15. He scored 3 tries and kicked a conversion in the win in the match which was played at Onehunga. Interestingly a week later after a 5–3 win over Richmond the New Zealand Herald said List “was but a shadow of the player of two or three seasons ago”. A week later he was moved back to centre and was involved in the only try of the match which Mount Albert won 3–0 over Newton. List was said to have “showed a distinct improvement and gained useful ground by strong, straight running”. Against Devonport on July 13 he “played fairly well at centre”. On July 20 in a 18–6 win over Marist he scored a try and was “in form at centre for Mount Albert, and frequently showed up for solid running”. Although he “spoiled a good game by dropping passes when tries looked possible”. Against Ponsonby in round 14 List was forced into the forwards when Richard Shadbolt was injured and List then played well there. Following the match, won 17-11 by Mount Albert it meant that they were tied in their inaugural first grade season with Richmond for the championship after the last round. A final was required to find the 1935 champion between the two sides on August 10. Mount Albert lost the match 15–9 at Carlaw Park. The Auckland Star said “List was always going great guns at centre for Mount Albert, his one failing being weak handling at times”. Both List and Schultz proved “tough nuts to crack” for Ted Mincham in the centres for Richmond.In the Roope Rooster knockout competition he was in an 18–15 win over Marist. It was a bad tempered match due to Mount Albert having several former Marist players including List who was said to have been prominent. This was his last match of the season as he did not play in any of Mount Albert\\'s remaining matches. Mount Albert seniors and reserves. The 1936 season marked the beginning of a period of several years where List began to play a mixture of senior and senior reserve grade matches for Mount Albert. In 1936 he played 8 senior games, scoring 2 tries. He began the season playing 2 games for their top side and in the second against Devonport on May 9 he “did well with limited opportunities”.At this time Claude\\'s brother Francis was named in the Mount Albert reserve grade side. Through the remainder of the season Claude was named in the first grade side in some weeks but not others. On May 30 he was named to play Manukau who had rejoined the competition after years absence. Mount Albert won 23–18 over the eventual champions in Manukau. List was said to have “showed up for powerful bursts on occasions”. The following week in a 21–18 loss to City List scored his only points of the season for the first grade side, 2 tries. Over the remainder of the season he played in senior grade matches against Marist on June 13, Manukau on August 1, and Marist on September 12, either not playing in the other 6 matches or else playing for their reserve grade side.. 1937 saw List playing the entire season in reserve grade. In a June 12 match he was listed in the reserves with his brother Francis. In 1938 he again began the season in reserve grade with his brother Francis. By this point in his career he was 36 years old and had been playing senior rugby league for 14 seasons. On June 10 he was named in their June 11, round 9 side to play Papakura at Carlaw Park. This was possibly the first time that both List brothers played together in the senior side. Claude was involved in a try to Bert Leatherbarrow while “F. List, a junior … did good work in the forwards”. A week later in a 10–8 win over Ponsonby Francis scored a try but Claude was not “impressive” on the wing with Campbell the Ponsonby wing beating him for a try. Claude was playing right wing three-quarter but was playing closer in to the forwards and was involved in his brothers try, making a run before passing to Wilson who passed to Bert Leatherbarrow who sent it on to Francis to score. After the match it was suggested he should move back to the wing. The following week against Newton, in an 18–13 win he was involved in a try to Jack Tristram after List had first passed to Ernie Pinches. In a 9–3 win over North Shore the next weekend the Herald said that List, “the veteran international, can still make his presence felt, and he was hard to stop. His all round play on the wing was good”. He then spent a few weeks in the reserves before again playing for the senior side on August 13 against City in a 28–13 win on Carlaw Park #2. He set up Wilson and McNeil\\'s tries with “strong running” beating the City backs twice. He along with Wilson were said to be Mount Albert\\'s “outstanding backs” with Lists “straight running a good feature of their back play”.In the final round of the competition Mount Albert beat Papakura 44-12 but they needed a Marist loss to force a playoff for the championship. With Marist winning 10-7 it meant Mount Albert was runner up. It was his final first grade match of the season. He “showed plenty of dash at centre”. He was playing in the backline with fellow New Zealand internationals Clarrie McNeil and Roy Hardgrave. His final match of the season was Mount Albert\\'s reserve grade final loss to Richmond 16-10 where he was up against George Tittleton, another former New Zealand international.The 1939 season saw List play the year in the reserve grade competition. Mr. Huxford awarded List a trophy for services rendered at the annual general meeting on February 20, while his brother Francis won the award for the most consistent forward. Claude also win the C. Elwin Memorial Cup for the annual 100 yards championship. He again spent the 1940 season entirely in the reserve grade. Mount Albert during the war. With the war having begun during the 1939 season many senior sides were struggling for adult players. The reserve grade competition ceased and many veteran players were called back into action for their former sides. The 1941 season saw List once again resume his senior playing career for Mount Albert. He played 19 games and scored 2 tries at the age of 39, now in his 17th season of senior football. An unprecedented period of time at that level in Auckland rugby league through its early decades.. List played in their round 1 match against Marist List was playing in the forwards and was said to be “prominent” in their 20–18 loss. In their next match against City he again played “well among the forwards”. In an 11–10 win over Newton on June 7 List “was a tower of strength among the forwards, and Shadbolt and Tristram gave good support”. He played another “good game” in Mount Albert\\'s 13–8 win over Richmond on June 21. He put in another strong performance against the heavy Manukau forward pack in a 14–5 loss on June 28. Before being described as a “hard toiler” in their 30–8 defeat to North Shore on July 5. List was next mentioned after a 10–6 loss to Ponsonby on August 16 in round 14, doing “good work among the Mount Albert forwards”. While he showed “good form a week later against North Shore.A short article then appeared in an Auckland Star supplement on September 6 about List’s career. It said “few, if any, players in the rugby league code can boast a playing record of 29 years continuous football. This goes to the still fit and active Claude List, who in turn shines as a back, or a forward, for Mount Albert. List made his debut in the league code in Auckland for the old Kingsland club in 1921, and since then he has gained both New Zealand and Auckland representative honours. He first got into an Auckland team in 1927, and actually was picked to represent New Zealand in 1928, while still a senior B grade player… His greatest success came in 1932 when he played all three tests for New Zealand against England. At Christchurch, in the second match, with [[Bert Cooke (rugby)|A. E. Cooke badly hurt, Claude played the greatest game of his career. Many times his powerful fend came into action, and he stood out as the best of the New Zealand backs. Jim Sullivan, the English captain, reckoned that List was next to A. E. Cooke, the most dangerous attacking back his team had met in the Dominion, besides which his tackling was always a great asset. Claude first played football for a league team in Queensland as a schoolboy in 1912. Nearly every Saturday List can be seen at Carlaw Park giving assistance, and he is still up to the best first grade standard”.His first try of the season came in a 10-6 Roope Rooster round 1 loss to Marist on September 20. In a Phelan Shield win over Newton on October 4 he “ably led the attack” along with Bert Leatherbarrow and Jack Tristram. The in a 21–12 win over North Shore in the semi-final of the Phelan Shield he scored his second try of the season. They then defeated Richmond in the final 8 points to 6 with List “playing well” in the forwards.The 1942 season was to be List\\'s last. Due to the reduction in senior players the Auckland Rugby League made the decision to combine several of the sides during the middle of the war. Mount Albert was merged with Newton Rangers and ultimately finished 4th of the 6 sides. List did not play their initial matches but made his season debut on June 6 in their round 4 match with Manukau. They lost 10–5 with the Auckland Star reporting that “the Newton-Mount Albert XIII against Manukau was strengthened by the addition of H. Leatherbarrow, international hooker, and C. List. Both are experienced Mount Albert forwards”. Against Richmond on June 6 he was a “prominent forward” in a 23–17 win. He played a match against Ponsonby on June 13 and then it appears that the final game of his career came on June 20 against the City-Otahuhu side. For the final time in his career he was said to be “prominent” among the forwards in the 16–10 win. List was not mentioned in any of their remaining games and retired from the sport that he had played for 30 seasons. Personal life and death. After initially living in Glen Eden when the family moved to New Zealand they soon moved into the inner city suburbs. In 1928 List was living at 141 Newton Road, Auckland and was working as a mechanic according to census records. In 1931 he married Iris (Margrey) Thornburn on March 25 at St. Matthew\\'s Church in Auckland. They had one son, Trevor Henry Wilchefski, born on December 29, 1932. In 1935 they were living on Paget Street in Freemans Bay, before moving to Hepburn Street in Ponsonby in the late 1930s throughout the 1940s. In 1949 they had moved to Pollen Street in Ponsonby where they lived until the mid-1950s before moving to Main Rd in Silverdale in the late 1950s.. Claude died on April 17, 1959, aged 56.', 'title': 'Claude List', 'qa_pairs': '[{\\'Q\\': \\'Which two media mentioned in the text appear most often?\\', \\'A\\': \\'The Herald and The Auckland Star.\\', \\'type\\': \\'comprehension_and_reasoning\\', \\'S\\': [\\'The New Zealand Herald said during the week that “playing for the B team, List, the Kingsland player, showed up\\\\n\\\\nas a fine wing-three quarter.

      "{'input': ' Projected outcomes. For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 °F (0.2 °C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 °F (1.1 °C) by 2020 and up to 3 °F (1.7 °C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer\\'s driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington’s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington.. Three main conclusions were outlined: Climate change impacts are visible and the economic effects are becoming apparent.. The costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise.. Climate change will provide economic opportunities.:\\u200a7\\u200a. The economy of Washington State will dictate the effects of these impacts.   These effects are unique to Washington due to individual natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade.Climate change can directly affect the amount of resources that generate economic activity. Climate change can also affect the quality of important resources such as fresh drinking water, irrigation of crops and the generation of electricity. Climate change can also accelerate the depletion of capital assets used toward the formation of seawalls that are needed to protect shorelines from rising sea levels. Climate change can affect human health in ways that impact families and the workforce (e.g., premature death, increased sick days or leaves of absence, health care costs and insurance claims). All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington\\'s gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State—Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain\\'s glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.  This valley owes its special characteristics (wide-open expanse, wildflowers and views) to its heavy snows and short growing season—keeping it clear of trees.  Higher temperatures may mean that trees will take over these meadows, also preventing wildflowers from growing.  Scientists have already detected loss of mountain meadows on both the wetter and dryer east sides of the Olympic National Park.Forestlands comprise a significant element of Washington\\'s economy. Out of Washington State\\'s 43,000,000 acres (170,000 km2), 22,000,000 acres (89,000 km2) are classified as forestland. These forestlands support a great variety and number of economic activities, from timber production to the protection of freshwater supplies and wildlife habitat. In 2002, total employment in lumber, wood products pulp, and paper was 43,700. Timber collected on public land represents 16% of the current output from the lumber industry. Forest growth. Beyond affecting wildfires, climate change could impact the economic contribution of Washington\\'s forests both directly (e.g., by affecting rates of tree growth and relative importance of different tree species) and indirectly (e.g., through impacts on the magnitude of pest or fire damage).  The impacts are unknown and may be either positive or negative.. One sees that climate change arises from changing temperature levels, soil moisture, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and other factors—all of these things affecting tree growth. While estimates for changes in Washington forests are unavailable, other studies suggest the impacts to be significant.  A study of El Dorado County, California suggests a reduction of timber yields by 18-31% by the end of the 21st century, primarily because of increased summer temperatures. Pests. Beyond growth rates, climate change could affect Washington forests by changing the range and life cycle of pests.  Very little is known about the likely impacts here, and some changes could be positive, such as the possibility of the shifting of existing pests out of Washington\\'s forests instead of attracting new pests in.  More likely to dominate, however, are the downside risks.  Washington\\'s forests have evolved to deal with existing pests, causing the loss of such pests to be of little matter.  More detrimental, could be the introduction of new pests—an example of which can be seen in British Columbia where the introduction of the mountain pine beetle, which is already native to nearly the entire Pacific coast of North America, has infested and decimated lodgepole pine forests.  This infestation is linked in large part to increasing temperatures. Electricity. Washington State relies on hydropower for 72% of its power and sales of hydropower to both households and businesses topped $4.3 billion in 2003. Washington State has the 9th lowest cost for electricity in the US. Climate change will have a negative effect on both the supply and demand of electricity in Washington.. The biggest factors determining the effects on electricity are annual temperature changes and the change in peak snowpack melt and stream flow. A change in precipitation could also have an effect on electricity supply and demand, but dramatic changes in overall precipitation are not expected. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts a 300 megawatt (about 1% of Washington\\'s generating capacity) reduction in electricity demands during the winter for each degree the temperature rises. Summer demands would probably increase due to more widespread need for air conditioning in order to keep homes and businesses cool, although estimates are still unknown.  Washington State\\'s reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) means that changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows are important to the supply of electricity. Pg. 38. The available electricity supply could also be affected by climate change. Peak stream flows are in the summer.  Snowpack is likely to melt earlier in the future due to increased temperatures, thus shifting the peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer stream flow.  This would result in an increased availability of electricity in the early spring, when demand is dampened, and a decreased availability in the summer, when the demand may be highest. The economic impact from climate change in Washington could seriously alter the finances of the state. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predictions for the future of hydropower are grim. The state generates $777 million in gains from power sales. However, by 2020 they expect to see this fall to a deficit of $169 million and by 2040 a deficit of $730 million. These numbers understate the production shortfalls for the state because the number of air-conditioners were kept constant at current levels.  A recent assessment on climate change in Washington done by researchers from Oregon State University has published estimates that a revenue impact of 5% or less ($165 million).. Hydropower is more susceptible to climate change impacts than other sources of electricity, so consumers may be subject to greater rate increases than consumers in other states.. Washington residents have low costs for electricity due to only a few electricity companies being investor-driven. In 2006, Washington residents paid 6.82 cents per kWh, compared to the national average, which was 8.9 cents per kWh. Most of Washington\\'s power companies charge only to break even. Thus, while prices may rise in Washington, they may still be comparable to other states in the US.Climate change will also affect how the state purchases electricity. During the summer months, Washington sells electricity to states such as California and Arizona because prices for their states is high in these seasons. During the winter months, Washington purchases electricity from these states because of the state\\'s need for increased heating and lighting. Therefore, increased temperatures in the summer months will alter the selling of electricity to these states and cause the state to lose money. Municipal water supply. Seattle\\'s municipal water systems may hit capacity in 2050.  In the October 2005, King County Climate Change Conference, a key topic of discussion was municipal water supply. Experts predict shorter winters and longer summers, which potentially can lead to winter flooding and more severe summer droughts. A 2005 University of Washington study states that the city of Seattle could see a 14% drop in water supply by 2040.  This decrease in the water supply would be equivalent to about 170,000 more people moving into the area. The Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) estimates that it will be able to maintain 171 million US gallons (650,000 m3) per day production for the next 50 years and meet demand which is estimated to maintain itself at 130 million US gallons (490,000 m3) as other cities such as Bellevue begin to use their own water supply. However, these numbers fail to take into account the effects of climate change. It is predicted that by 2040 the water levels will actually decrease to 147 million US gallons (560,000 m3) per day.With a predicted increase in temperature of 3° by 2040, the region\\'s water supply as a whole is expected to decline.  Water supplies come from glaciers and mountain snowpack.  As temperatures rise, the elevation at which snow normally falls will increase, and there will be less water available during run-off seasons. Winter and early spring will produce more water than late spring flows, which will decrease the amount of available water during the summer. A lack of water will be problematic for both humans and the region\\'s wildlife. This issue is also concerning because as water levels decrease, there is an expected increase in population in the Puget Sound region. The municipal water supply problem will affect different regions differently depending on the amount of public served by them and the amount of water supply that they can tap into. Everett for example, has a population of 100,000 and the Sultan river provides it with a vast amount of water compared to its population, so global warming will have a minimal effect on the supply of water to it. The Seattle region gets the bulk of its water from the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds. As the effects of global warming cause water levels to decrease in these watersheds, new water sources must be found. One idea proposed by a utility consortium, Cascade Water Alliance, is to use Lake Tapps, located in Pierce County as a new source of drinkable water. The project is projected to cost $450 million and take decades to complete. These reservoirs are very important to the continued stability of the municipal water supply. Reservoirs hold the early spring melt of snow so that in the summer months it can be released when the snowpack is gone. Reservoirs must be made larger to hold more of the early spring runoff. This will cost millions, if not billions, of dollars to the states\\' taxpayers. This, however, will only help slightly. It is projected that by the year 2040 snowpack levels that used to dip to a dangerously low level appeared every 50 years will do so every 5. No matter the size of the reservoir, if there is not enough water to fill them then they will be of little help. The other alternative to curtailing water usage would be to increase the price the consumer has to pay for the water. Snow and ice. Washington State is one of the nine contiguous states that has mountainous glaciers. These glaciers of the Olympic Range and the Northern Cascades produce 30 billion cubic feet (850,000,000 m3) of water every year. These glaciers are losing their size rapidly. The Southern Cascade Glacier in Darington has lost two-thirds of its volume. The glaciers in these ranges have, on average, decreased by 31 feet (9.4 m) and between 18 and 32% of their volume of water. An increase of 3.6 °F (2.0 °C) will cause 65% to 75% of the glaciers to disappear in 40 years. The retreat of the glaciers will help to increase the decline. Glaciers reflect the incoming light from the sun. With less glacial cover the rocks on the mountain will heat up causing the surrounding frozen ice to melt even faster. Drainage basins that use glacial runoff will also be affected. Glaciers contribute to a base level of water that runs off after all of the new snow cover has melted. The Middle Fork River is likely to see huge decreases in its water levels in the coming years due to this issue. The Middle Fork provides a large amount of drinking water to Bellingham.. Precipitation in the Cascades has begun to be altered drastically. While the level of precipitation on the Cascades has not decreased since the 1950s, it has begun to shift from snow to ice when it falls. The level of glacial runoff is also on the uptick since the 1950s. The level of water that flows into Puget Sound has decreased by 18% since 1949.. Water flows can be split up into three categories in Washington: Rain dominant, snow dominant, and transient snowmelt watersheds. The change in water falling will make snow dominant regions appear to be more like transition rivers and transition more like rain dominant. Snow dominant regions have their highest water flow several months after their highest snowfall. Due to the increase in temperature, they will change and act more like transition which has two peak flows, one in the spring due to snowmelt, and the other in the winter due to water falling as rain, not snow. The transition region now will act like rain regions which have their high points in river flows right after it rains. Agriculture. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale.  Agriculture is probably responsive to climate variability and weather extremes, such as droughts, floods, and severe storms. The forces that shape the climate are also critical to farm productivity. Human activity has already changed atmospheric characteristics such as temperature, rainfall, levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ground level ozone. The scientific community expects such trends to continue. Warmer climate may give positive effects on food production; however, the increased potential for weather extremes will pose challenges for farmers. Moreover, water supply and soil moisture could make it less feasible to continue crop production in certain areas.. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) concluded: Recent studies indicate that increased frequency of heat stress, droughts and floods negatively affect crop yields and livestock beyond the impacts of mean climate change, creating the possibility for surprises, with impacts that are larger and occurring earlier than predicted using changes in mean variables alone. This is especially the case for subsistence sectors at low latitudes. Climate variability and change also modify the risks of fires, pest and pathogen outbreak, negatively affecting food, fiber, and forestry.. Climate Factors. Several factors directly connect climate change and agricultural productivity: Change in precipitation amount and patterns. Rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Pollution levels such as ground level ozone. Change in climatic variability and extreme eventsMost agricultural impact studies have considered the effects of one or two aspects of climate change on a particular farming activity. Few, however, have considered the full set of anticipated shifts and their impact on agricultural production across the country.. The ways in which climate changes in Washington will affect agriculture are largely unknown. One benefit which climate change may potentially have on agriculture is the possibility of longer growing seasons. However, some of the negative effects include reduced water supply and higher demand for water. Some of the unknown effects are changes in the behavior of weeds, pests and crop diseases.. With the shifts in climate, Washington exports of agriculture goods may fluctuate. The impacts of these fluctuations are largely unknown due to the complexity and unknown extent of the changes to come. Yakima Valley. The Yakima River Basin is the most productive and driest agricultural region in Washington state. Yakima, Kittitas, and Benton County of the River Basin produced $1.3 billion in agricultural economic output in 2004. Without adequate water available for irrigation, the basin will face serious economic impacts. Research at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) determined that the $1.3 billion output was due to water availability. Past droughts caused 10-15% losses of economic output, not including the accumulation of water loss over the years. Compared to a \"good year\" where the outputs are estimated at $901 million, droughts and crop losses will become more prevalent due to water shortages increasing from $13 to $79 million per year by mid-century. Water shortages will cause higher costs for farmers and amplify economic losses during drought years. Expected global increases in temperatures will have economic effects not easy to quantify. Decreased snowpack and earlier runoff will decrease stream flow. Higher temperatures will increase evaporation in the soil and decrease its capacity to hold moisture for plants during the hottest parts of the growing season. Insects will find a haven in warmer temperatures and become a greater problem.  The Columbia River Gorge is beginning show signs of adapting to warmer temperatures by producing a 3rd generation yearly. Increased numbers of hot days (over 100 °F) are expected to cause increased levels of heat-related illness, which makes the agricultural workers population especially vulnerable. . Simple tools developed to forecast the impacts of El Niño on agriculture irrigation can also be used to estimate the impacts of water shortages during climate change.  Studies that focus on the water availability to the 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of orchards, vineyards, and food crops within the Yakima River Valley exploit the effects of a climate change in the region. Irrigation draws water from only five reservoirs and snowpack from the Cascades. With the arrival of early snowfall and a premature diminish, irrigation water supply is predicted to drop 20-40% in a year at mid-century due to this dramatic change. The loss to agriculture in the Yakima River Valley would be $92 million for a 2 °C increase and $163 million for a 4 °C increase.While the amount of rainfall may not change in this region, the snowpack will due to rising temperatures. The reduction of snowpack will lower the availability of water during critical growing seasons. As water-related losses make agricultural methods less productive, reduction in the economic viability of the Yakima River Basin follows. The changes in temperature and precipitation caused by climate change means risk management options will take a more permanent form when addressing changes in crops, cultivators, and adding storage. Dairy production. A significant rise in global temperatures will negatively affect dairy production in Washington state, which had a total of 560 dairy farms at the end of 2004. Each region will be affected differently based on the different climate and temperature fluctuations. Current predictions forecast that by 2075, milk production in the Yakima River Valley will drastically decrease during the summer months. The worst effects of climate change will be a decrease in daily milk production from 27 kg to 20 kg in the month of August. Whatcom County dairy farms are predicted to be less affected by climate change than Yakima Valley. Summer milk production in Whatcom County is projected to fall from a little under 27 kg per cow per day to slightly more than 25 kg per cow per day. In both regions the lower milk production is directly correlated to the decrease in consumption of food stuffs. The decrease in food availability during summer is due to increasing annual temperatures that shift precipitation levels and cause a faster run-off of snowpack. With less food for the cows, milk production drastically decreases during the summer months. Higher temperatures cause a decrease in milk production. Wine. Washington State holds second place, following California, for US wine production. A change in climate will cause vineyards to move. In 2004, wine grapes accounted for $127.5 million and were the state\\'s 4th largest fruit group in terms of value. In 2005, the wine industry as a whole was a $3 billion industry, providing the equivalent of 14,000 full-time jobs. While it is a young industry in the state (introduced in the 1960s), it has been consecutively gaining momentum. Climate change could negatively impact Washington\\'s wine industry.. The Yakima and Mid-Columbia valleys are the most heavily populated vineyard regions. The predicted water shortage within the next decades, due to early snow melts and unavailability in seasons following, could lead to a potential crop loss increase from $13 million to $79 million by mid-century. Because wine varieties are highly sensitive to temperatures, an increase could cause several Eastern Washington areas to move out of the ideal range for certain varietals. The climate shift could make western areas such as Puget Sound more ideal for wine production. If the magnitude of the warming is 2 °C or larger, then a region may potentially shift into another climate maturity type, which is the specific climate favorable to maturing a certain type of grape. For instance, the chardonnay grapes of Western Washington mature well at 14–16 °C, while merlots typically produced in Eastern Washington do best at 16–19 °C. The shift of vineyard concentration to the coastal regions would mean a shift in local land value and use, production, revenue and employment. This shift would be due to an increase in average temperature. However, scientists’ main concern is not the gradual increase, but that global climate change will cause more instances of extreme weather. Increased extreme weather would result in greater losses for vineyards, especially those grown east of the Cascade Range. Wheat. Eastern Washington produces a large amount of wheat that is affected by climate.a large amount Some models of daily temperature do not account for the topography in eastern Washington, resulting in distorted temperature predictions. Both topography and temperature affect the yield of wheat, but a new system called the Regional Climate Model (RCM) considers topographical data, resulting in a more accurate temperature estimate.  In a recent study, winter wheat productions were taken at different elevations, both with and without irrigation, and the best yields were in areas with a lot of rainfall, temperate conditions, and at elevations from 1000 to 1500 meters. Both non-irrigated and irrigated harvests have increased with global warming, which has also allowed for increased production at higher elevations. The harvests also improved with the presence of higher levels of carbon dioxide. Cranberries. Cranberry production in Washington makes up a moderate amount (less than a tenth of a percent) of agricultural revenue for the state. These berries could be affected by higher winter temperatures due to climate change. This would mean considerable losses in revenue in Washington. Washington is the fifth largest supplier of cranberries in the U.S., producing 3% of total U.S. production. There are three growing regions in Washington, including Whatcom County, Grays Harbor County, and Pacific County. Fish industry. Washington, being located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, depends heavily on the Pacific Ocean, Puget Sound, the Columbia River and many other rivers for its fishing industry. Therefore, changes in the current climate could have significant results.. On February 22, 2008, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) issued a report titled \"In Dead Water: Merging of climate change with pollution, over-harvest, and infestations in the world\\'s fishing grounds\", warning that three quarters of the world\\'s key fishing grounds are at risk of being  seriously impacted by rising temperatures. They reported potential consequences as changes in oceanic circulation patterns, currents that bring nutrients and remove waste from fisheries, rising surface temperatures that are expected to bleach and kill as much as 80% of the world\\'s coral reefs – major tourist attractions and nurseries for many juvenile fish, and finally, the possible acidification of the ocean\\'s waters as warmer water absorbs more atmospheric carbon emissions. Increased acidity would impact organisms that utilize calcium for shell-production. Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said: In Dead Water has uniquely mapped the impact of several damaging and persistent stresses on fisheries. It also lays on top of these the likely impacts of climate change from dramatic alternations in ocean circulation affecting perhaps three-quarters of key fishing grounds up to the emerging concern of ocean acidification... it is clear from this report and others that it will add significantly to pressures on fish stocks. This is as much a development and economic issue as it is an environmental one. Millions of people including many in developing countries derive their livelihoods from fishing while around 2.6 billion people get their protein from seafood.\"In addition, rising temperatures are contributing to decreased snowfall and increased rain during winter months, leading to a decrease in the winter snowpack. The snowpack captures winter precipitation at higher altitudes where it acts as a bank, slowly releasing water during dryer months. The decrease in snowpack levels will lead to earlier peak flows in area streams and rivers, increased flooding, and loss of irrigation and drinking water. Also affected would be threatened salmon runs. As local water districts debate increasing water storage in dams and reservoirs, a push to consider the effects of increased water control on Washington\\'s salmon fisheries is underway.. Climate change can also lead to loss of habitat and native species as warming temperatures allow the northern movement of invasive species. For example, the increased spread of the aquatic plant Swollen Bladderwort; a free-floating carnivorous plant, it is easily spread by waterfowl and has adapted itself to reproduce in multiple ways. Uncontrolled spread of the species, creates thick mats of vegetation which: Reduces the water\\'s oxygen content. Increases fish mortality rates. Poses a danger to boatsWhile this is a single example of an invasive species given a stronger foothold by warming temperatures, this situation can lead to further invasions that risk countless native flora and fauna.. In 2007 the  United States National Academy of Sciences reported that increased temperature coupled with loss of snowpack, and lower spawning flows are likely to lead to increased mortality among juvenile salmon, particularly Chinook, in the Snohomish River Basin and hydrologically similar watersheds. Increases in reservoirs and flood-control structures could mitigate peak-flow effects in lower reaches of Washington\\'s watersheds.  However, it would not have much impact on higher altitude headwaters where the effects of decreasing snowpack are more severe and the opportunities for flood-control are less likely. Increased loss of habitat and reduced escapement from increasing temperatures would have a significant economic impact on the state\\'s overall commercial, recreational and tribal fisheries. Seattle is home to the Alaskan fish fleet. Any current change in the amount of fishing allowed will negatively affect Seattle\\'s economy. Commercial fisheries. The following is a partial section of the information provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department and emphasizes the need for adaptability when looking at potential responses to the economic and ecological impacts of global warming on commercial fisheries: \"The impact on fisheries of changes in the biological productivity of marine ecosystems will vary between fisheries and will depend of the specific environmental changes that occur and the particular biological characteristics of each species. Changes in a particular marine environment may become conducive to a rapid growth of a high-priced species found in that environment, while the reverse may be true in other instances. Climate change will also result in modifications of the area of distribution of marine resources. Most likely they will move towards the North or South pole, whichever is closest. Consequences for the fishing industry could be significant. An expected characteristic of global climate change is a likely increase in the variability of environmental conditions. Experience already gained in dealing with longer term fluctuations in marine environments, such as those induced by El Niño events, emphasize the need for adaptability. As well, ensuring sustainable economic levels of fishing capacity should be determined with the variability in mind. The effects of climate change on fisheries will impact a sector that is already characterized by full utilization of resources, large overcapacity and conflicts among fishers, and others, vying for alternative uses of marine ecosystems. Thus, climate change adds a further argument for developing effective and flexible fisheries management system in an ecosystem context.\"According to the National Fisheries Conservation Center, in May 1994 and again in August 1995, widespread salmon fishery closures in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California resulted in the declaration of a fishery resource disaster declaration by the Secretary of Commerce. An estimated 8,000 commercial fisherman were affected by the closures. Following the declaration $25 million in economic aid, of which $13.6 million was allocated to the State of Washington, was provided via the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan. The funds supported habitat restoration, data collection and salmon license buyback programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided and additional $10 million in disaster unemployment assistance, with $6.4 million of those funds being allocated to Washington. The Rural Development Administration provided $3 million in grants to finance small business development and the Small Business Administration made low-interest loans and debt-restructuring available. All costs that could potentially continue to increase as global warming further degrade existing commercial salmon fisheries. Other potential costs may include an increase in the amount of government-sponsored buyback programs. These programs are designed to ease fishing pressure on declining stocks while providing financial assistance to those individuals who choose to exit the fishery. Buybacks take the form of Vessel Buyback Programs and License Retirement Programs. The average cost of a license or vessel purchased fewer than one of these plans is $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets but can rise as high as $10 million for a factory trawler such as those used further north in the Bering Sea. Nationally, these programs have totaled $160 million nationally since 1976. Lake Washington. According to the Washington Department of Fish And Wildlife, Lake Washington is believed to hold the largest urban sport salmon fishery in the United States. Research has shown that the temperature of Lake Washington\\'s upper layers or epilimnion, have risen more than 2.5 °F (1.388 °C) in the past 40 years. Overall the water temperature has increased a full degree Fahrenheit. The effects on local salmon runs are increasing as well. As the water warms, the lake\\'s resident population of zooplankton such as Daphnia, important food for juvenile salmon, are declining. Increased temperatures are delaying fall turnover and maintaining stratification nearly 4 weeks longer than in previous years. Earlier stratification means earlier algal blooms, necessary food for zooplankton such as Daphnia. Normally, the spring burst in the Daphnia population coincides with local algal blooms, providing them with the food they need to survive.  However, earlier blooms now mean that other zooplankton are eating the algae before the main Daphnia bloom, severely curtailing Daphnia numbers which have dropped by more than 50% over the last 26 years. In addition, salmon in stratified lakes are more likely to seek shelter in lower cooler layers of water leaving them more vulnerable to predation. It is estimated that rising temperatures played a major part in the disappearance of roughly half the sockeye salmon returning to the Cedar River watershed through the Ballard Locks and Lake 4Washington in 2004. Sport fishing. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Department reported that nationwide, 27.85 million US residents purchased fishing licenses in 2006 and the federal tax revenue generated by sport fishers was $8.9 billion, roughly the equivalent to that year\\'s budget for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It has been noted that determining a definitive valuation of sport fishing is entirely subjective and based on supply and demand. Some factors that can be taken into account when determining value, other than tax revenue, are the market value of the fish that are caught, gross expenditures, i.e. travel, equipment, fishing license, expenses on site, etc., generation costs, defined as the cost of generating the demand, and market value of the fishing water, defined as the fisherman\\'s willingness to pay for the ability to have access to the resource being valued. A 2003 report by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and a 2001 report by the American Sportfishing Association estimates that the economic impact in 2001 of restored salmon habitat on recreational fisheries in the state of Washington could potentially have yielded $1 billion in revenue and 9,400 jobs. Expanded to include Oregon and Idaho, revenue estimates for restored Northwest fisheries totaled $5.5 billion per year. The loss of these fisheries could then be assumed to potentially result in the loss of that revenue. In addition, as reported by the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, the numbers mentioned in these reports do not take into account the fact that recreational salmon and steelhead fishing is more costly than other sport fishing types and therefore accounts for more than their percentage of the total. In addition, these figures do not include economic totals from commercial or tribal fisheries. Local economics. Salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead and many other fish that are used economically will be negatively affected by the increase in temperatures. Southern species, including Hake and Mackerel are predators of baby salmon. Scientists say these species have been feeding on salmon migrating out of the Columbia River.  These fish need cold and clean water to reproduce successfully. The high and low flows of the rivers will be shifted in the seasons, negatively affecting salmon rearing. Increases in water temperatures could affect the food for fish in rivers, lakes, Puget Sound and coastal ocean regions. Fishing is big business in the Pacific Northwest and many local economies depend on fishing. There is a current debate on how to allocate the run of salmon. The local Native American tribes get a modest percentage of the statewide income from salmon fishing, with the majority going to commercial fishermen. The ones left out are the sport fishermen, those who participate in recreational fishing. The economic problem with this is that sport fishermen spend much more money per fish caught, and since they are less efficient, they drive the economy through the Spending multiplier throughout the local economy. The salmon allocation is hotly contested and when salmon populations are low, local economies suffer the majority of the impact. During 2007, the commercial fishermen caught 43% and the sport fishermen caught 57% of the total fish. Native Americans\\' treaties guarantee them a maximum of 50% of the total run before the commercial and sport fishers take their share, under the Boldt Decision of 1974. Human health. Impacts on infectious diseases  West Nile fever is a serious disease linked to climate change in the US that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It favors periods of drought and heavy rain, which are likely to become more common as increased average temperatures in Washington State result in rain replacing snowfall during the winter, resulting in drier summers (chance of drought, particularly east of the Cascades).  The mosquitoes will also survive longer because the warmer winters will not eliminate as many bugs as it usually does. Documentation of the West Nile virus is just beginning in Washington State, but Colorado has been grappling with cases of it since 2002. Total costs there have been estimated at $120 million or $670 million (P. 58), both as of 2006. Louisiana has been battling cases since 2001, with total costs of $190 million by 2006.  In the hopes of avoiding these costs, the Washington Department of Health spends $246,000 per year on surveillance for the virus and Epidemiological follow-up and testing on suspected human cases (P. 59). Dengue fever is an infectious disease also carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of four related dengue viruses. It is also called \"break-bone\" fever because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. Health experts have known about dengue fever for more than 200 years.. An epidemic in Hawaii in 2001 was a reminder that many locations in the United States are susceptible to dengue epidemics because they harbor the particular types of mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.. Worldwide, 50-100 million cases of dengue infection occur each year. This includes 100-200 cases in the United States, mostly in people who have recently traveled abroad. Many more cases probably go unreported, because some health care providers do not recognize the disease.. Impacts on respiratory illnesses, (such as asthma and allergies) . Washington\\'s asthma prevalence is among the highest in the nation, costing the state over $400 million yearly. 400,000 adults and 120,000 children suffer from it in Washington. Though increases in average yearly temperatures is the hallmark of global warming, human activities are the cause of greenhouse gases like emissions from cars, power plants, and airborne particles from human-caused forest fires. Global warming has a \"direct\" effect on respiratory illnesses because increased CO2 levels stimulate pollen production, which stimulates allergies. More frequent flooding in WA State will increase the growth of fungus, also exacerbating allergies. Increased carbon dioxide levels have already and will continue to increase the level of pollen output in the state. In 2001 when carbon dioxide levels were 370 parts per million the pollen output for a common ragweed was twice the level of output that plants used to give out at 270 parts per million, which was the level before the industrial revolution. One possible scenario for the coming years is that pollen count could increase to 20 grams per cubic meter. This would cause a serious increase in the need for medication for allergies and exacerbate the effects of global warming on the economy.Impact on heat-related illnesses. Heat-related deaths will increase as average yearly temperatures increase. More frequent days over 100 °F (38 °C) will cause several problems for humans, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. The amount of heat waves has increased in the state of WA over the past 20 years. The average cost for each mortality from heat-related deaths is $6,250. These occur when the human body is so overwhelmed by heat that it no longer can combat the extreme level of heat. Urban settings will see even worse conditions. At night, heat levels can remain dangerously high. This is because buildings and roads absorb heat during the day and release this heat at night.  Studies of heat-related mortality in eastern WA had highs of 107 °F in 2006. Hospital charges for heat-related admissions in 1998 was roughly $6250 per patient. Coastal management. The University of Washington\\'s Climate Impacts Group (CIG) has worked to study the factors that affect the coastal regions. One prominent area of focus for CIG is forestry practices. To help protect coastal waters, there has been a reforestation act that states that satisfactory reforestation must take place within need a number here? years after logging.  How does this citation correspond to what is cited? And what would be considered \"satisfactory reforestation?\" Research results suggest that as forest cover decreases to a point where less than 65% of the forest has surface cover greater than 10%, the conditions stray outside the norm.   Despite the research, there is still much uncertainty as to how pollution and logging will affect the climate.  In 1976, it marked the development and first ever approval by the Federal Government of Washington State\\'s (WA) Coastal Zone Management (CZM) program. The terms and features of a state\\'s approved CZM program are provided in what is commonly known as a state\\'s \"CZM Program Document.\"  WA\\'s 2003 updated program document is referred to as \"Managing Washington\\'s Coast.\"One of the features of the federal CZM program important to the states is \"Federal Consistency.\" This simply means that any public federal project carried out by a federal agency, or private project licensed or permitted by a federal agency, or carried out with a federal grant, must be determined to be consistent with the state\\'s CZM program.. Coastal water quality has always been an important part of the federal—state coastal zone management program.  In 1992 Congress provided for increased emphasis on coastal non-point pollution.  WA, along with other states in the national CZM program is developing a Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan.. WA also participates in the federal Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP); its purpose is to protect critical coastal and estuarine areas having significant conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, and threatened by conversion.  Although dedicated grant funds have yet to be authorized by Congress, a state plan has been drafted to assure WA\\'s eligibility for future participation.There is also research on the effects on coastal boundaries in Oregon and California. Outdoor recreation. Washington\\'s economy is particularly susceptible to being affected by climate change in the mountains, due to the large ski industry.. Climate change will result in more rain and less snow across mountainous regions. Earlier melting of Washington\\'s snowpack will negatively affect conditions as well, as this snowpack is responsible for ideal slope conditions, and its water supply. The  breakdown of the snowpack occurs in early spring, leaving summer months dry and ending [winter sport|snowsports] much earlier than before. Over 40% of winter recreation in the past 10 years took place at lower elevation ski areas (Snoqualmie Summit, Mt. Baker, and Mt. Spokane ski areas are most likely to be affected by climate change). The Summit at Snoqualmie experienced \"warm winters\" in 27% of the years from 1971 to 2000, and may experience over 50% \"warm winters\" by 2040.  Washington\\'s ski resorts contribute greatly to the state\\'s economy. Over the last decade there was an average of 1.65 million visits per year. Annual revenue from Washington\\'s ski areas ranges from $50–$150 million for ski passes, tickets, and rentals. This does not include secondary revenues from skiers\\' food, retail sales, etc. The winter recreational season is shortening considerably due to less snow fall. Sea level rise. At Seattle, Washington, sea level is already rising by increments of 8 inches (200 mm) per century, and it is likely to rise another 19 inches (480 mm) by 2100.. The four main factors that contribute to sea level rise (SLR) are: thermal expansion of the ocean. melting of land-based ice. local atmospheric circulation. local tectonic movement.  The report on Sea Level Rise in the Coastal Waters of Washington State summarized the possible sea level change for the Northwest Olympic Peninsula, Central and Southern Coast, and Puget Sound region and for each made estimates for very low, medium, and very high sea level change. For the year 2050, estimated Northwest Olympic Peninsula SLR ranged from -12 cm to 35 cm with negative SLR due to the predicted upward tectonic movement. Central and Southern Coast estimates ranged from 3 cm to 45 cm and Puget Sound was estimated at SLR of 8 cm to 55 cm. These values roughly double in all regions for the 2100 projections. Homes and businesses within reach of tidewater and low-lying agricultural areas in Washington are at high risk for flooding and current developers and anyone developing or buying property will likely take SLR into account before making an investment. Parts of Tacoma and Olympia are at higher risks than other cities like Seattle, since many areas in Tacoma and Olympia are built just a few feet above sea level. pg. 65. Current estimates project that Tacoma and surrounding areas could see sea levels rise from 5 to 16 inches (410 mm) by 2040. It is said that \"shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and recreational facilities associated with coastal port districts are places where impacts will reach more deeply into the state’s economy through effects on commercial and recreational activities.\" The cost of preparing for such rises is largely unknown; however, Seattle has five seawalls and plans for rebuilding of the Alaskan Way seawall may increase in cost by 5-10% based on projections for sea level rise. pg. 65.. Methods to protect shorelines are to build a seawall or to pump sand onto beaches to prevent erosion. Attempts at managing river flow for the direction of increased water levels is also a possible way to control SLR. When considering the cost to protect shorelines, it is difficult to calculate due to some shorelines being developed and others undeveloped. Agricultural factors and the potential loss of profit from SLR in that vector, is also difficult to predict and often unaccounted for. Potential development for housing is often excluded also. An estimate of potential national cost to protect land from SLR and considering such variability of land quality but excluding future value, is $270–475 billion for a one-meter rise in Sea Level. Changing shorelines. Shoreline change can be defined as the erosion of the beach, when the amount of incoming sand does not equal the amount of  outgoing sand.. With over 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of shoreline, Washington State is especially vulnerable to climate related shoreline changes caused by rising sea water levels. The impact of sea level rise will depend greatly on the amount of rise which occurs, an estimate that falls between 3 inches (76 mm) and more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) within the next 100 years. An increase of two feet in sea level will cover an area of the state close to 56 square miles (150 km2) and would affect 44,429 Washington residences.  Agricultural areas such as Willapa Bay and the Skagit River Delta including Fir Island will be the first hit hard because their dikes and tide gates will be easily overrun by the rising tides.The changing sea levels will have different effects along the state\\'s coastline.  Tectonic forces are causing the Cascade Peninsula to rise in step with the rising oceans. Other areas of the coastline will not be so lucky. Areas from the central to the southern region of the coast are vulnerable to the rising waters. The Puget Sound region is very vulnerable to the waters because this area is in fact gradually subsiding at a measured rate of around 24 mm a decade. As the sea level rises and this area moves down relative to the sea level it will be impacted at an earlier time than the rest of the state.The threat of eroded beaches is not the only problem to face the coastline. Global climate change will increase both the intensity of the waves that crash onto Washington\\'s coast line and the height of the waves. The combination of higher water levels and more catastrophic waves will cause even higher rates of damage to the coast line. These waves will destroy infrastructure that is near the coast including roads, railways, and water treatment systems and will cost the Washington State tax payer untold sums of money to both fix and prepare for.Change in the type of land along the shoreline will also change. Tidal flats will decrease thus effecting the population of shellfish along with other coastal animals. Loss of this land could also lead to the increase of salt marshes and effect the salinity of surrounding areas. The economic effects of such land changes would be the decrease in shellfish supply, and a decrease in land value as marshes grow.The economic importance of the coast is generally easier to measure than its aesthetic value. Waterfront property generates much of the residential tax base for coastal communities. Proximity to waterfront adds approximately 28 percent to the value of real estate and can be higher in some areas of Washington. In many cases development proceeds without consideration of long- and short-term shoreline change, particularly erosion. Hundreds of millions of dollars of shorefront real estate is at risk due to both chronic, long-term erosion of coastal bluffs and episodic, storm-induced erosion of dunes and barrier beaches as well as worldwide increases in sea level.. Several companies have seen the potential to make money on these developments and as a result a new industry of \"Climate Change Risk Reporting\" has formed. Online services promise to determine your risk of flooding due to climate change by using your physical address. Flooding. Due to the estimated .5° increase in temperature each decade described in the report, increased flooding will be experienced in many of Washington\\'s coastal areas. As global temperatures rise, it causes the oceans to warm up and expand. Ice caps and glaciers also melt, and the amount of rain increases as the amount of snow decreases. All of these factors contribute to the rise in sea level, which is a principal cause of flooding. Homes and businesses within reach of tidewater and low-lying agricultural areas in Washington are at high risks for flooding. Parts of Tacoma and Olympia are at higher risks than other cities like Seattle, since many areas in Tacoma and Olympia are built just a few feet above sea level. It is said that \"shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and recreational facilities associated with coastal port districts are places where impacts will reach more deeply into the state’s economy through effects on commercial and recreational activities\" pg. 65. The areas that are to be affected first by the increased pattern of flooding include Willapa Bay and the Skagit River Delta Ecological impacts. Ecological impacts are expected to be great, with many indicators already visible.  They will be caused both directly (warmer temperatures, greater storm event intensity/frequency, etc.) and indirectly (rising sea level, more frequent wildfires, etc.) by climate change. Washington is expected to have a 0.1 - 0.6 °C (0.2-1.0 °F) change per decade.(WA-CC-report, P. 22)  Because of this, and an expected increase in fuel buildup in some forest types, wildfire frequency and devastation will increase.(P. 24)  Wildlife will be affected by climate change, with most species or populations subject to problems as a result of changes in distribution and temporal mismatching of phenological events. Statewide assessments will be used to determine what species and habitats are to be preserved. These places may not provide protection to the same species in the future due to ecosystem variation brought on by climate change.(WA-CC-report, P. 22)  These range shifts are individual rather than community-based, and therefore will cause dramatic community shifts in composition and/or density.  This will likely result in the eventual extinction of many local populations and potentially entire species, causing an overall loss of biodiversity. Plant wildlife. Changes in plant wildlife as a result of climate change have already been observed.  As a result of greater atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, plants have exhibited increased efficiency in water use, potentially resulting in changes in community composition and vegetation types, as well as possible but unknown effects to the global hydrological cycle.  Also, as a result of increasing temperatures, tree lines have been observed advancing further north and upward vertically. (P. 7) Non-vascular. There is little research to date on climate change\\'s effects on non-vascular plants.  However, current findings suggest that most lower elevation non-vascular plant communities will increase in biodiversity due to invasion from southern species moving north.  In contrast, many higher elevation non-vascular plants are considerably more sensitive to changes in the environment and are expected to suffer from reductions of growth and range, as has already been seen in the Alaskan tundra.  This is made worse by invading tree populations as the tree line rises, reducing non-vascular alpine habitat.. Due to reductions of snowpack, and therefore reductions in summer water availability, significant changes in species distribution and habitats are likely to be observed as well, dictated by each individual species\\' ability  to adapt, or more specifically, their seed dispersal rate, barriers to seed dispersal, and basic competition. (P. 19) Vascular. Initially, global warming will result in a lengthening of the annual growing season.  However, while apparently a positive change, it is unknown to what extent plants will be affected by summer water shortages, whose effects are likely to be seen in changes of species distribution and habitats, all limited by the efficiency of adaptation of various species. (P. 19). Like non-vascular plants, higher elevation vascular plants are expected to experience a reduction in habitat as a result of the upwardly invading tree line.  Likewise, forest expansion at lower elevations into sagebrush steppe and grassland regions are also predicted as a result of increased water-use efficiency, due in part to greater atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  This will, in turn, result in the extinction or vast reduction of many grassland and sagebrush steppe communities. (P. 18–20). Phenological effects will also be evident, as changes in growing season and temperatures will result in earlier leafing-out and/or flowering of many species.  This may cause temporal mismatches between herbivores and availability of key food staples, and will also be seen, perhaps with more drastic effects, in parasite/host and pollinator/plant relationships. (P. 19) Animal life. Range shifts in many species have been observed over the past century, with an average northward migration of approximately 6 km per decade.  Should an expected increase in temperatures prove true, at the magnitude of two to ten times greater than the last 100 years, even more range shifts and reordering of ecological communities can be expected. Invertebrates. The greatest impacts upon invertebrate land animals, such as butterflies or grasshoppers, will be seen in the areas of northward and vertical migration as well as a variety of phenological changes.. Changes have already been observed in the distribution of insects active year-round.  As an example, during the past thirty years, the Sachem Skipper butterfly of California extended its northernmost edge 420 miles (680 km) north into WA State.  We can expect to see many more examples of such changes in range or distribution in the future.. Temporal mismatching of species\\' biological events is likely to cause more complicated problems.  One such example is the potential for the timing of butterfly hatching and the flowering of their host plants to drift apart, especially in years of drought or excessive snowpack.  This may result in the complete crash or extinction of many species or populations, and may contribute to more species migrating further north.. The greatest ecological impact concerning invertebrates as a result of climate change will likely be seen in the destruction caused by insects whose populations expand in both range and lifespan, as can be seen with the mountain pine beetle throughout the northern United States and Canada.  Due to a lack of low winter temperatures to reduce the beetle populations, their range and population expanded, resulting in extreme reductions and devastation of many Whitebark Pine trees, especially at higher elevations. (P. 21)  As of October 2005, British Columbia, Canada, had lost more trees to beetle infestation than to wildfires or logging in an area three times the size of the US state of Maryland, resulting in 21,000,000 acres (85,000 km2) of infestation, and 411 million cubic feet (11,600,000 m3) of trees killed.  This has had cascading effects, especially on grizzly bear populations as pine nuts are an important source of winter time food in periods of large snowpack. (P. 21) Birds. Like other animals, the most apparent changes are expected in the areas of phenology and species and population distribution.. Poleward and upward elevation shifts have been observed already.  However, in contrast to other species, the increased mobility of birds indicates that they will likely experience expansions in total livable habitat rather than reductions.. Though phenological changes may not be as detrimental to birds, between the years of 1971 and 1995, a UK study revealed that 31% of the birds studied were laying their eggs an average of 9 days earlier in 1995 than in 1971. (P. 22) Mammals. Mammals appear to be more resilient to the effects of climate change, as little evidence can be found of its impact on their populations or individuals.  It has been established that there are genuine connections between fecundity and juvenile survival and winter temperatures.  Also, distribution shifts northward and upward in elevation can be expected. (P. 23) Amphibians. Amphibians stand to be some of the worst affected by climate change, due largely to the dependence on water regimes and need for specific microhabitats, as well as their limited dispersal abilities.  During the last century, rapid declines in amphibian populations were observed worldwide, and extinctions and reductions of amphibian species in the tropics have been caused both directly and indirectly by climate change.  Indirect effects include the extinction of many amphibian populations and species worldwide due to changes in the distribution of pathogens and diseases.  Other potential consequences include the indirect consequences of habitat modification caused by wildfires, fire changes, and changes in sea water levels and quality, as well as the direct consequences associated with rising temperatures.(P. 23–24). Phenological challenges are considerably more prominent in amphibians than in other vertebrates.  The calling and breeding phenology in spring has advanced.  Six different frog species in New York State have experienced a 10- to 13-day advancement in callings associated with 1 °C to 2.3 °C rises in temperature during breeding months.  Likewise, studies in England have shown an advancement of amphibian breeding by 2 to 7 weeks over a 17-year time period.  Despite these surprisingly extensive effects, some amphibians appear unaffected in any negative way by these changes. (pg. 23–24) Reptiles. The greatest impact upon reptilian species will be seen in changes in phenological events, but their limited dispersal abilities may also prove detrimental in conjunction with their specific physiological temperature constraints.  Reproduction and development in many reptiles has been linked directly to climate, resulting in the possibility of very profound effects should temperatures continue to rise.  For example, in some species the sex of the offspring is directly dependent upon the temperature of the egg.  With the painted turtle, a 4 °C rise in temperature would result in solely female offspring. (P. 24) Fish. Fish will likely be victim to extensive changes in distribution.  Many species, such as salmon, cannot live in water over 21 °C.  In addition to direct effects of temperature, increased volume and changed timing of stream flows are likely to cause many river-spawned eggs to wash downstream.  Another significant factor is the timing of spring upwelling.  Though unknown to what extent future climate change will affect upwelling, if at all, it is a phenomenon which is directly dependent upon climate and is essential in the survival of young fish when they reach the ocean.. The hardest hit freshwater fish habitats will be in mid to high elevations where reduced snowfall will have the biggest impact.  Additionally, stream temperatures and the potential increased presence of invasive species is likely to have negative effects on most native fish. (P. 25) Wetlands. Wetland area will reduce significantly, and most are in danger of flooding, drying up or relocating.  This reduction is bad due to the role wetlands play in: Absorbing CO2. Efficiently absorbing surplus storm water (which will be more frequent and extensive in the future). Recharging aquifers and keeping streams from drying up during dry summers due to wetlands\\' natural water storage capacity (P. 7). Filtering pollutants from water, helping provide livable habitats for fish and wildlife.  In Washington State, over half of all fish and wildlife depend on wetlands for their survival at some time in their lives, including bald eagles, coho salmon, and frogs. (P.1) Preparing species, habitats, and ecosystems for climate change. In 2011, the Washington State Department of Ecology released the interim recommendations of a multi-stakeholder collaboration on preparing Washington\\'s natural systems for the impacts of climate change, as part of the Dept. of Ecology\\'s integrated climate change response strategy. The recommendations include goals and strategies for building the capacity of Washington\\'s species, habitats, and ecosystems to adapt to the effects of climate change, and are available here. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Current climate change is due to anthropogenic GHG concentrations. Human activities including burning fossil fuels, waste, and wood products cause CO2 emissions. CO2 is the least common type of GHG, while water vapour is the most common. Methane is emitted during coal, natural gas, or oil production. Other sources include agricultural livestock and decaying organic matter. Nitrous oxide is emitted through industrial and agricultural activities. Many industrial companies have switched from burning coal and petroleum fuel to natural gas. More toxic pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, are emitted in smaller rates and are known as High Global Warming Potential Gases.The state government regularly publishes GHG inventories. The EPA helps forward the process by providing the state with inventory guidance and technical assistance. These inventories provide the state with useful information about emissions. From here policies will be implemented and added to the State Climate Change Action Plan.Washington State pumps out 85 to 90 million tons of GHG per year. Washington is responsible for 0.3% of the yearly GE emissions. Since 1970 the amount of harmful gases emitted by the state has grown by 75%. This figure is in line with the greenhouse output trend globally. Washington produces 13.5 tons of CO2 per person per year. This number is 30% lower than the national average due to the state\\'s reliance on hydropower. This number is three times larger than the average person per year for the world, which is 4 tons per year.Traffic congestion accounts for a significant percentage of WA State\\'s contribution to GHGs.  In the 2006 summary of Washington\\'s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report, reported by CTED of WA, in 2004 Motor gasoline, diesel and jet fuel CO2 emissions were responsible for nearly 98% of the transportation.. The social cost of traffic congestion in Seattle amounts to $1.4 billion annually, and this wasted gasoline accounts for 1.1 billion lbs. of CO2 emissions (496,230 metric tons).Washington generated most of its energy from hydropower until 1972 when a coal plant in Centralia opened. Naturally, this caused CO2 emissions to increase. Emissions remained steady until the early 1990s when natural gas was introduced into the spectrum of energy generation. Washington\\'s electric energy is responsible for approximately 1/3 of the total increase of CO2 emissions. In 2006, electricity was responsible for 20% of all GHG emissions, but transportation is the main cause of GHG emissions in WA State. It is accountable for 43% of all emissions. Washington is equal to the national average in petroleum related emissions at 8.4 tons and ranks as the 26th in the United States according to the WA State Dept. of Community, Trade & Economic Development report published in 2006. Seattle\\'s Climate Action Plan and the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol requires developed countries to reduce their GHG emissions below levels specified for each country in the Treaty. Even though the United States federal government did not ratify the protocol, mayors around the United States have accepted the challenge. In February 2005, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels challenged other mayors across the states to unite in the fight to meet or exceed the Kyoto Protocol\\'s emissions reduction goals. In March 2006, the Mayor\\'s green ribbon Commission delivered its report giving recommendations on how the city should go about to beat Kyoto\\'s goal of a 7 percent reduction in green house gas emissions by 2012. The end affect should be a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 680,000 tons per year. Seattle\\'s Climate Action Plan consists of: reducing Seattle\\'s dependence on cars, increasing fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels, achieving more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle\\'s homes and businesses, building on Seattle\\'s leadership policy action, and to sustain Seattle\\'s commitment policy action.. Seattle\\'s first plan is to reduce Seattle\\'s dependence on cars which is projected to cut emission by 170,000 tons. Their first plan of action is to significantly increase the supply of frequent, reliable and convenient public transportation. The single largest source of Seattle\\'s GHG\\'s come from the approximate two billion miles driven by gasoline fueled cars and trucks. The success of reducing this is to supply an alternative to driving. The city plans to invest $1.5 million to increase transit services and Transit Now plans to match the $1.5 million if the ballot passes in Seattle. Another alternative to driving is Sound Transit’s Link light rail system that will operate between downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The city will also implement a 10% commercial parking tax to set in over a three-year period beginning July 2007. Seattle also plans to rezone certain areas to provide neighborhoods easy access to transits, light rail systems, and provide amenities close enough to walk or bike. Mayor Nickels has allocated $100,000 to work with regional partners in an effort to explore and develop road pricing scenarios. Road pricing can take the form of tolling based on road congestion, the time of day, or even miles driven. These courses of action are to increase the incentives to substitute driving for a much more environmentally friendly commute.Seattle\\'s second plan is to increase fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels; the projected cut in emissions is expected be 200,600 tons. Seattle will start by increasing the biodiesel blend from 20 percent biodiesel to as much as 40 percent in 2007. The use of biodiesel is growing and Seattle wants to promote the use of biodiesel by making it state law to require at least 2 percent by volume of diesel sales to be biodiesel. The port of Seattle uses B99 biodiesel (99% biodiesel 1% petroleum diesel) for its own use and also cuts emissions by turning off their diesel engines when in port by using electricity from Seattle City Light.  The electricity from Seattle City Light reduces GHG emissions from ferries by 30 percent.  The Seattle Police department will begin replacing all of its non-pursuit vehicles to efficient gas-electric hybrids in 2007.  Seattle will also provide incentives for taxicab owners to use gas-electric hybrids, and will also work in conjunction with taxi companies to decrease the amount of GHG emitted from their vehicles.Seattle\\'s third plan is to achieve a more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle homes and businesses which is projected to cut GHG emissions by 316,000 tons. City Light has committed to acquire at least an average of 7.5 megawatts through conservation measures in 2007 and 2008, and they have already achieved its net-zero emissions status for 2007 by offsetting whatever emissions they produced by reducing emissions elsewhere. City Light spends about $2 per customer per year to meet its approximate carbon offset of 200,000 metric tons. City Light will continue to purchase 3 percent of its energy from Stateline Wind, a wind energy company. Seattle Steam Company, which provides heat and hot water to customers, will convert one of its fossil fuel boilers to an urban wood waste biofuel that will cut GHG emissions by 50,000 metric tons a year.. Seattle\\'s fourth plan is to extend the city\\'s leadership. Seattle\\'s second largest department, Seattle Public Utilities, will evaluate its own greenhouse gas emission inventory and create a reduction target and action plan. Seattle plans on purchasing carbon-offset projects to compensate emissions from all business-related air travel by City employees. Seattle also plans to launch a campaign to encourage all City employees to reduce climate pollution not only on the job but also at home. Also, a new Department of Executive Administration green team will assess, and decide on whether to purchase climate friendly products, such as super-efficient \"80-plus\" computers and servers.Seattle\\'s fifth plan is to inspire action. The Seattle Climate Partnership will provide employers with resources for assessing their climate pollution and implementing strategies for reducing emissions. The Department of Neighborhoods will launch a Neighborhood Climate Protection Matching Fund to help promote and finance neighborhood based projects that are geared towards reducing emissions and climate pollution.As of October 2007, the city of Seattle released that they have exceeded their goal reducing emissions to 8 percent of 1990 levels. There are 218 cities that have joined Mayor Nickels in a campaign to reduce emissions to at least 7% of 1990 levels. Even though the United States as a whole has not ratified the protocol, if all cities meet their goal, the joint reduction of emissions from the 219 cities, representing 44 million people, is equivalent to reductions from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries combined, says Denis Hayes, co-chairman of the mayor\\'s Green Ribbon Commission on Climate Protection, which released the plan. Although Seattle is exceeding their goal of reducing GHG emissions, population growth fueled with their resistance to alternate methods of transportation is threatening their Kyoto goals.. For a cap and trade situation or even a tax to be truly effective they need to affect the individuals of the populations. Applying a tax to gas would greatly reduce the population\\'s willingness to drive and make alternatives to drive more attractive. Also incentives to purchase hybrid cars, use biodiesel, and other climate friendly alternatives will greatly reduce fossil fuel dependence and use. Responses to climate change in Washington. Job growth. Forbes magazine ranked Washington State the fifth best state in the nation for business, and 3rd for environmental quality.  The emerging \"green economy\" (green collar jobs) designed to achieve efforts toward low carbon and sustainability is anchored by clean energy. WA is a national leader in addressing climate change and has taken steps to reduce its climate impact, and as a result opportunities for growth in the economy have been generated. Sustainable family wage jobs are developed through a focus on cleaner energy, smarter use of natural resources, and adoption of advanced technology. State Energy Policy Office studies documented 3,800 clean energy jobs in 1998 and 8,400 jobs in 2004. The Washington Climate Advisory Team (CAT) expects the state to meet Governor Gregoire\\'s job creation goal of 25,000 clean energy jobs by 2020. And, Washington could potentially reach 31,000 family-wage jobs by 2025.. Clean Energy Sectors Include: Energy efficiency. Renewable energy (including solar, wind, fuel cell, geothermal, and biomass). Smart energy (using technological advances to improve all steps of the energy production to end-consumption process)Clean Energy Industry at a Glance: 241 organizations, 8,400 jobs. Average salary $60,000. More than $2.1 billion in 2004 revenues. 64% greater concentration of clean tech jobs in WA (highest per capita jobs and revenues were in Eastern WA) than the U.S. average Mitigation. The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) is working to develop regional strategies to mitigate climate change in 6 states of the western U.S., including Washington, and in the westernmost provinces of Canada. Its main thrust as of 2008, is to develop a region-wide multi-sector cap-and-trade program.In 2007, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire’s executive order passed putting into effect her climate change challenge goals.. Governor Gregoire aims to: Reduce Climate Pollution, and reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.. By 2050, reduce emissions by half of the 1990 levels.. Grow the Clean Energy Economy and create jobs that use cleaner energy. (Clean energy jobs grew 45% between 1998 and 2004).. Generate an increase in job growth to 25,000 by 2020.. Move toward Energy Independence (in 2006, $9 billion were spent on imported fuel—Gregoire hopes to recover that money to cycle it back into our economy by generating our own renewable fuel industry).. By 2020 reduce spending on imported fuel by 20 %.In 2005, Seattle reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% when compared to 1990 emissions. Despite Seattle’s economic/population growth since 1990, energy use has gone down. Programs, such as the Seattle Bicycle Master Plan (SBMP) will reduce emissions even further by increasing the number of bike lanes and improving pedestrian sidewalks. Mayor Greg Nickels, \"Center City Strategy,\" will cluster growth within Seattle by promoting urban/compact living within its downtown and local neighborhoods. Mayor Nickels, along with 700 other Mayors nationwide, signed the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement that requires cities to meet or beat the Kyoto Treaty emission targets by 2012. Policy. To reduce the impacts of climate change, the state of Washington has enacted several pieces of legislation in recent years. These pieces cover areas such as construction, waste, water, air quality, and so on. There are different policies to pursue specifically in Washington State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to reduce GHG emissions have to take place in Washington as well as across the globe in order to minimize further warming.. As Washington State backs the need to decrease carbon emissions, the legislature is searching for ways to fund the formation of renewable energy sources. The bill SHB 1032, which would tax families and businesses to generate financial support for new renewable energy sources, has raised several concerns for taxpayers and ratepayers, and also questions as to whether this will efficiently reduce CO2. This bill would begin to tax every utility customer approximately $1.90 a month, regardless of how much energy the customer uses. This incongruous attempt would leave industrial users paying the same as poverty-level families, and is arguable for several reasons.. First, such taxation will hit low-income families more heavily than wealthy families. Second, because the fee is a surcharge, there is no way to reduce the fee by taking affirmative action in reduction of energy use. This leaves no incentive for people to reduce their use, but may in fact increase people\\'s use since they are paying the same amount as everyone else.. Analysis of SHB 1032: Adding Subsidies for Renewable Energy Production. Executive Order 07–02, signed by Governor Gregoire on February 7, 2007, presented goals of decreasing emissions that contribute to global warming overall, as well as decreasing the use of foreign oil allowing for more employment in fields that make clean energy such as hydropower and solar power. Washington State has also encouraged public participation in the incorporation of clean energy practices into citizen\\'s daily lives. The Climate Advisory Team (CAT) put together a collection of incentives for factories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The Preparation and Adaptation Working Groups (PAWGS) proposed proactive approaches to decrease or accommodate the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels. The Citizen Engagement and Action Framework (CEAF) also furnished suggestions to decrease citizens’ impacts. The CEAF also encouraged the public to take responsibility in arranging actions when some of the impacts are observed. CAT\\'s proposed reduction of greenhouse gases. Washington\\'s Climate Advisory Team (CAT)  published its guide to reducing Washington State\\'s greenhouse gases on February 1, 2008.  While comprehensive in nature, the report\\'s goals can be summarized as follows:. Build market-based mechanism to unleash investment in the creativity and innovation of Washington\\'s economy to deliver cost effective emission reductions.. Establish emissions reporting so that progress in emission reductions can be tracked and acknowledged.. Analyze greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation options early in decision-making, planning processes, and development projects.. Invest in worker training for the emerging Clean Economy to ensure having a skilled workforce and to provide meaningful employment opportunities throughout the State.. Build and continue to redesign communities that offer real and reliable alternatives to single occupancy vehicles.. Ensure Washington has vehicles that are as efficient as possible and use non-carbon or lower carbon intensity fuels developed sustainably from regional resources.. Focus investments in Washington\\'s transportation infrastructure to prioritize moving people and goods cleanly and efficiently.. Design, build, upgrade, and operate new and existing buildings and equipment to maximize energy efficiency.. Deliver energy from lower or non-carbon sources and more efficient use of fuels.. Restore and retain the health and vitality of Washington\\'s farms and forest lands to increase carbon sequestration and storage in forests and forest products, reduce the releases of greenhouse gas emissions, and support the provision of biomass fuels and energy.. Reduce waste and Washington\\'s emissions of GHGs through improved product choices and resource stewardship.. Allocate sufficient state resources to maintain Washington\\'s leadership role regionally and nationally and to fulfill its responsibilities for structuring and guiding implementation of emission reduction strategies. Green building. In February 2000, Seattle became one of the first U.S. cities to enact a green building policy. Called the Sustainable Building Policy, it requires all city-funded projects covering more than 5,000 square feet (460 m2) to achieve at least a LEED-silver rating. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is a voluntary, national green building rating system that certifies buildings for their sustainable construction and operation. Projects can receive four levels of certification - Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum. These four levels are determined by the number of points a project receives using the LEED rating system. As of May 2006, the city has 9 LEED-certified buildings, with the most notable examples being the Seattle City Hall and Seattle Public Library, both of which are LEED-silver rated. On April 21, 2005, Washington became the first state to require that new public buildings meet the LEED standard. Similar to the Sustainable Building Policy, this law covers all state-funded facilities larger than 5,000 square feet (460 m2), including school buildings.. Examples of innovative green building techniques appear here at the Green Building Features Page. Economic gains from green building. Green building has proven not only to be good for the environment but for economic gains as well. A green building can yield increased value to the owner. A \"green\" designation can also increase a buildings market value as assessed by appraisors and investors. An upfront cost of 2% to support green design would on average result in life cycle savings of 20% of total construction, more than ten times the initial investment costs. An initial investment of $100,000 to build green in a $5 million project would result in savings of $1 million over the lifetime of the building. Green building enhances the community and local economy. Pollution. Global greenhouse gas continues to increase and many nations and states. are taking actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including Washington state who has teamed up with Oregon and California in an effort to reduce emissions as part of the West Coast Governors’ Global Warming Initiative. The main Global greenhouse Gas released in Washington include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and other gases that contribute to global warming. The different emission types are placed into three categories: energy, industrial processes and agriculture. Different greenhouse gases range in their individual impact on global warming. For instance, one pound of nitrous oxide is 296 times more potent than a pound of carbon dioxide in contributing to global warming. This means even small quantities of gases emitted into the environment, like nitrous oxide, can have significant impacts on global warming.. For Washington state in particular, energy related emissions are the dominant source of GHG emissions and have increased from 61.2 MMT CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) in 1990 (excluding residual fuel for transportation) to 74.6 MMT CO2-e in 2004, while their share has increased from 79% of total emissions to 85% over the past fourteen years. Carbon dioxide is the dominant GHG followed by methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Non-energy industrial global greenhouse gas emissions have lowered from 14% to 9%,. mainly due to reduced emissions from aluminum production. This has been the result of two key elements: process changes that reduced CO2 and PFC emissions per ton of aluminum. generated, and the post-2000 decline in aluminum manufacturing rates. Non-energy agricultural. greenhouse emissions have remained fairly constant but their percentage contribution has lowered as total emissions have increased. Here is a broken down list of pollution contributors in Washington State: 45% transportation, 16% in state electricity generation, 12% industry, 9% residential and commercial, 2% non-CO2 (other gasses), 9% industry (non-energy), 7% agriculture (non-energy). As you can see, the majority of energy GHG emissions and almost half of total emissions are from the transportation sector. Prohibition of recyclables in garbage. Given that about one-quarter of Seattle\\'s garbage consists of easily recycled materials (paper, cardboard, aluminum cans, plastic bottles and yard waste) the city council decided on a mandatory recycling ordinance for its annual economic value.   The \"Prohibition of Recyclables in Garbage\" is estimated to save residents and businesses as much as $2 million per year by keeping future garbage cost low and aiding to the declining recycling rates since 1995 because the recyclable materials themselves hold value.. As of January 1, 2005 the city of Seattle (Ordinance # 121372) forbids the disposal of recyclables.  In harmonization of commercial, residential, and self-haul, garbage penalties will now be enforced if more than 10% by volume of the container is recyclables.  Enforcement with consequences began January 1, 2006.  Enforcement of the ban varies dependent upon type of pick-up. Single-family Residents: City contractors will not pick-up garbage cans that have significant amounts of recyclables.  A tag will be left instructing separation of the recyclables for the following week.. Apartment Owners/Property Managers:   City inspectors will mail two warning notices before a $50 fine is added to the apartment building\\'s garbage bill.. Business Owners/Property Managers:   City inspectors will mail two warning notices before a $50 fine is imposed.. Recycling and Disposal Station Customers:  Self-haul customers will be asked to separate recyclables and not to dispose materials into the garbage pit.Two years prior to the enforcement of this ordinance,  in order to put the new recycling requirements into practice, Seattle Public Utilities started educational outreach programs through direct mail and an automated (206) RECYCLE phone number was established to help answer basic questions about recycling requirements.

      "{'input': ' Background and early life. Nagaenthran a/l K. Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran\\'s death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network\\'s video interview of Nagaenthran\\'s mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children\\'s grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran\\'s thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father\\'s heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King\\'s demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court\\'s judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran\\'s defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal\\'s three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran\\'s appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran\\'s. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance — for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one\\'s mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. However, a psychiatric report concluded that Nagaenthran had neither of the above. He was also not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the CNB, since he did not substantively assist them in disrupting the drug trafficking activities. Despite this, on 24 February 2015, Nagaenthran brought forward the application and tried to ask for mercy based on the conditions of an intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which would have made him ineligible for the death penalty. High Court reviews. In 2017, the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran\\'s re-sentencing application. Four psychiatric and psychological experts, including one called by the defence, agreed that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled. The High Court also found that Nagaenthran had repeatedly changed \"his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed\". The High Court found that Nagaenthran showed that he was \"capable of manipulation and evasion\" during his offence, as Nagaenthran tried to dissuade Central Narcotics Bureau officers from searching him at the checkpoint by stating that he was \"working in security\", playing into the \"social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.\"In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal of Nagaenthran\\'s case. Court of Appeal review. After the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran\\'s appeal for re-sentencing, Nagaenthran, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, filed two separate appeals to ask for the Court of Appeal to commute his sentence under the newly enacted death penalty laws, but the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on 27 May 2019. The Court of Appeal said that there were numerous inconsistencies in Nagaenthran\\'s account of his crime, which made it hard to rely on his defence given that they affected his credibility. The five judges - Sundaresh Menon, Belinda Ang, Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, and Chao Hick Tin - held that Nagaenthran may have a low IQ, but his mental responsibility for his offence was not substantially impaired. He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently.. Besides, Nagaenthran had known that it was unlawful for him to import heroin, and hid the drugs to avoid detection. He was also prone to being manipulative and evasive, as shown from his initial attempts to avoid being searched before the narcotics officers arrested him in 2009. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was \"the working of a criminal mind\" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong. Hence, Nagaenthran lost his final bid to be re-sentenced. Clemency petition and first public attention. Nagaenthran later appealed to the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob for clemency, which would have commuted his sentence to life imprisonment if successful, but his plea was rejected on 1 June 2020, which finalized his death sentence. The last time clemency was granted in Singapore was in 1998, when 19-year-old Mathavakannan Kalimuthu was pardoned from execution despite being sentenced to hang for murdering a gangster in 1996. Mathavakannan was paroled and released in 2012 after serving 16 years of his life sentence due to good behaviour.During the time Nagaenthran was appealing for clemency, his case attracted international attention and many who opposed the death penalty asked Singapore to spare Nagaenthran\\'s life; Nagaenthran\\'s mother Panchalai Supermaniam (aged 57 in 2019) and family also joined in the efforts to plead for mercy. In a 2019 news report, Malaysian human rights lawyer N Surendran denounced Singapore for unfairly subjecting a mentally disabled man to a death sentence, and he, together with Nagaenthran\\'s new lawyer M Ravi argued that there was no fair trial for Nagaenthran since his defence\\'s psychiatric evidence was allegedly not fully considered compared to the reports of the prosecution\\'s psychiatrists.Singapore\\'s law minister K Shanmugam, in light of prior accusations that Singapore was unfairly mistreating Malaysian drug traffickers (due to the increasing number of Malaysians being executed for drug trafficking), argued that there is no inequality in treating foreigners and locals under the law for drug trafficking. He said the majority of Singaporeans favour the death penalty and it would be good for both sides if drug traffickers were caught by Malaysian authorities, as the offenders could be dealt with according to Malaysia\\'s laws and not have to worry about Singapore\\'s capital punishment. Shanmugam emphasised that there should be no special treatment for Malaysian death row prisoners as it would undermine the integrity of Singapore\\'s law. Death warrant and stay of execution. Confirmation of execution date. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore since January 2020, there was an informal moratorium on executions, including Nagaenthran\\'s execution, possibly out of fear of spreading infections in Singapore\\'s Changi Prison, where all death row inmates, including Nagaenthran, were held on death row. This allowed Nagaenthran to live for at least one more year after his failed clemency appeal.. On 28 October 2021, in Nagaenthran\\'s hometown in Ipoh, Nagaenthran\\'s family received a letter (dated 26 October 2021) from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), which informed them that Nagaenthran\\'s execution date was scheduled on 10 November 2021. SPS also stated they will facilitate and help explain the travelling arrangements to any of Nagaenthran\\'s family members on the necessary procedures on quarantine and COVID-19 tests, as well as allowing the family to have extended daily visits with a prolonged duration of a few hours and a maximum of five visitors per visit to curb possible risks of COVID-19 infection within the prison walls, due to Singapore\\'s worsening rate of local transmission within the community (affected by the mutated Delta variant).At the time Nagaenthran\\'s death warrant was finalized, the last execution to be conducted in Singapore was on 22 November 2019, when 36-year-old Abd Helmi Ab Halim was executed for trafficking over 16g of heroin in 2015 despite appeals from Malaysia to commute his sentence. Opposition to execution. Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian\\'s life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran\\'s execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran\\'s case a \"flagrant breach\" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia\\'s Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran\\'s sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother\\'s execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran\\'s mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran\\'s family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran\\'s family. This allowed Nagaenthran\\'s mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran\\'s brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother\\'s care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran\\'s lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a \"five-year-old child\", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International\\'s researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran\\'s case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, \"Taking people\\'s lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran\\'s death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government\\'s response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran\\'s life. They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran\\'s case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore\\'s borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran\\'s life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore\\'s response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran\\'s mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore\\'s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran\\'s case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore\\'s law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia\\'s foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran\\'s case, but overall he maintained Malaysia\\'s respect for Singapore\\'s law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran\\'s mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer\\'s opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi\\'s arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was also heard on 9 November 2021. The rushed schedule to close up on Nagaenthran\\'s last-minute appeal process was criticised by lawyer N. Surendran as a denial of due legal process for Nagaenthran.During the appeal hearing at the High Court, the testimonies of the prison officers who knew Nagaenthran were presented in court disputed the supposed mentally ill behaviour of Nagaenthran. A senior prison officer who had befriended Nagaenthran for the past three years had not seen any abnormal behaviour from Nagaenthran, who was able to request religious counselling after being told that he would be hanged in the near future. Another prison officer said Nagaenthran had no problem communicating with the prison officers in English, Malay and Tamil, making requests and responding to instructions. Not only did he ask for religious counselling and a DVD player to play religious songs, Nagaenthran was also able to request for phone calls to his family members and for them to visit him, as well as selecting whichever prison officers who could help fulfill his needs during the final days prior to his execution. The Attorney-General\\'s Chambers (AGC) earlier requested to Nagaenthran\\'s lawyer to allow them to disclose the latest psychiatric records detailing Nagaenthran\\'s mental state, but Ravi objected to the disclosure.On 9 November, the day of the appeal at the Court of Appeal, Malaysia\\'s Communications and Multimedia minister Annuar Musa expressed to Singapore his hope that they could reconsider Nagaenthran\\'s case and spare his life. At the same time, the human rights experts of the United Nations also pushed for Singapore to spare Nagaenthran\\'s life.However, on 9 November 2021, it was reported that Nagaenthran had tested positive for COVID-19 just 12 minutes after he arrived at the Court of Appeal for his appeal hearing, and thus the execution on 10 November would not proceed as scheduled. Both Ravi and the prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong were informed of this by one of the judges in a courtroom packed with both local and international media and activists. His appeal was also delayed to allow Nagaenthran time to recover before proceeding with the appeal process. The appeal was heard by three judges: Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Kannan Ramesh.The next day on 10 November, the original date of Nagaenthran\\'s execution, the Singapore Prison Service revealed that prior to his appearance in court, Nagaenthran did not report any symptoms and was initially tested negative by the ART test before the results of the PCR test confirmed Nagaenthran\\'s COVID-19 infection. It was also revealed that Nagaenthran chose not to vaccinate himself from COVID-19, even though more than 90% of the prison staff and 90% of the prisoners were fully vaccinated from the virus. Several prison officers and some of Nagaenthran\\'s fellow prisoners at the death row cells of Changi Prison\\'s Institution A1 were also subsequently tested positive, and the affected death row cells were undergoing lockdown to avoid the infection from spreading. Nagaenthran and the people he interacted with were isolated to avoid spreading infection to more people and be given medical treatment in the meantime. There would also be measures taken to ensure regular testing of both prison staff and inmates for COVID-19. In addition to 54 supervising prison officers, a total of 169 prisoners from the prison, including those on death row, were confirmed to be infected as of 12 November 2021. Further death penalty debate and Singapore\\'s response. The case has brought light to the issue of the death penalty in Malaysia. While many human rights groups pushed for abolition of the death penalty, most Malaysians believed that the death penalty should remain for serious crimes like murder and certain offences of corruption other than drug trafficking, and support for the death penalty remains high in Malaysia despite the decreasing numbers of new death sentences given by the courts. Legal professionals and enforcement, including some lawyers and police officers, commented that there should be some powers of discretion given to the judges to impose life imprisonment in some capital cases instead of death with respect to its mitigating circumstances, but they generally felt that the death penalty is overall still relevant to use against drug trafficking and murder and other offences, given the rampant rate of drug offences committed in Malaysia. Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul Aziz, who was debating the Budget 2022 in Dewan Rakyat, brought up the case of Nagaenthran and hopes that Malaysia can review its death penalty laws for drug traffickers in Malaysia, given that it also executed many drug offenders while appealing for mercy on its citizens in other countries, which was inconsistent with their stance towards drug convicts in and out of Malaysia.In light of the growing pressure by the United Nations (UN) to pardon Nagaenthran, Singapore\\'s representative to the UN and Ambassador Umej Bhatia responded and highlighted that the courts in Singapore has already made it clear in their verdicts that Nagaenthran may have borderline intellectual functioning but he did not have mild intellectual disability, and they also gave their strictest due consideration to determine the eligibility of Nagaenthran\\'s condition for execution, and even Nagaenthran\\'s personal psychiatrist has also agreed that the Malaysian had no intellectual disability. With regards to the UN\\'s accusations that Singapore had violated international law by imposing death sentences on drug offenders who committed \"non-serious\" crimes by international standards, Singapore stated there was no international consensus on the death penalty or what was the threshold of \"serious crimes\", and every country has the sovereign right to decide on its use of the death penalty and the types of capital offences they defined under the law.When facing the UN\\'s other allegations that the fate of a drug offender were decided by the prosecution of Singapore and the unfairness towards Nagaenthran\\'s family with a long list of strict rules of COVID-19 travel regulations, Singapore rebutted it by stating that the prosecution\\'s decisions are independent of the government and they are still liable for review of their decisions, which Nagaenthran has already appealed for before the courts found no error after reviewing the prosecution\\'s decisions. The COVID-19 travel restrictions and rules were not discriminatory towards Nagaenthran\\'s family, as they were all similar to the ones which apply to all travellers entering Singapore from Malaysia during this period, and were made to address the present pandemic situation in Singapore, and the authorities made efforts to contact the family to allow them to understand the travel regulations and facilitate their stay in Singapore.On 12 November 2021, Singapore\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also revealed that the ministers in Singapore, including Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, had responded to their respective Malaysian counterparts that Nagaenthran was being accorded full due process under the law and was not intellectually disabled as confirmed by the courts and psychiatric assessments, hence there should be no intervention in his case. In response to the government\\'s statements, Malaysia\\'s human rights lawyer N. Surendran and Lawyers for Liberty claimed that the Singapore government was fabricating their stand that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process, stating that the courts had not given Nagaenthran a full due court process by not taking into consideration of his intellectual and mental impairment or making accommodation to address them during the court proceedings. Human Rights Watch\\'s senior disability rights expert Emina Ćerimović commented on Nagaenthran\\'s case, \"The inhumanity shown by the Singaporean authorities in Nagaenthran\\'s case is truly shocking.\" Ćerimović also added, \"The government\\'s determination to execute a man with an intellectual disability for importing a small amount of drugs is disproportionate and cruel, and deserves global condemnation.\" Further appeals from Malaysia and other parties. The Malaysian Bar, together with the Advocates Association of Sarawak and the Sabah Law Society, also activated their efforts to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency to lower Nagaenthran\\'s death sentence to life imprisonment, and they cited that they maintain their respect for Singapore\\'s laws but implored the city-state, on the basis of compassion and humanity, to assess Nagaenthran\\'s mental state to see if he is mentally competent to be hanged due to their concerns of the possible psychological impact that his 11-year death row period had on him. Both Nagaenthran\\'s family and lawyer M Ravi expressed on 18 November that they will sue Singapore\\'s attorney general Lucien Wong for negligence and willful disregard of human life by the judicial system. Wong sent a letter to Ravi, stating that Ravi\\'s other allegations against the legal system in Nagaenthran\\'s case amounted to \"contempt of court\" and he should retract them and apologise by a deadline of 22 November. However, Ravi has stated that he will not retract his statements or apologise to the attorney general.On 23 November 2021, Yang di-Pertuan Agong from Malaysia reportedly wrote to the President of Singapore, hoping that clemency could be given to Nagaenthran.On 26 November 2021, the Court of Appeal of Singapore was to give its verdict regarding Nagaenthran\\'s final appeal four days later on 30 November. However, the court date was postponed to sometime in January 2022, according to activist Angelia Pranthaman, whose brother Pannir Selvam was on death row for drug offences. She appealed to Singapore to spare the lives of both Nagaenthran and her brother and commute their death sentences. However, Nagaenthran\\'s lawyer M Ravi, who requested the adjournment, stated there was no definite date confirmed as the courts did not inform him of a new court hearing date. The adjournment was a result of Ravi\\'s suspension from his legal duties in view of his relapse from bipolar disorder.On 3 December 2021, the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob replied to the Agong\\'s clemency letter, firmly stating that Nagaenthran was being \\'accorded full due process under the law\\' and thus refused to grant clemency to Nagaenthran.The next court date for Nagaenthran\\'s appeal was set for 24 January 2022. The case would be heard by a five-judge panel comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Belinda Ang, and Senior Judge Chao Hick Tin. Nagaenthran\\'s lawyer M Ravi was also replaced by Violet Netto. As Nagaenthran\\'s appeal hearing was drawing near, concerned members of the international community, including British actor Stephen Fry, continued to appeal to Singapore to spare the 33-year-old Malaysian from the gallows. Final appeals and second death warrant. Last court hearing. On 24 January 2022, Netto sought an adjournment of the appeal, and it was granted by the courts. The appeal was eventually heard on 1 March 2022, in which Netto argued for Nagaenthran to be subjected to psychiatric assessment prior to his execution to assess whether he should be considered mentally fit to undergo his hanging. Netto also tried to admit the reports of two foreign psychologists as evidence to support Nagaenthran\\'s case. However, the judges stated that the last-minute drip-feeding of evidence were tantamount to an abuse of the court process. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong described the appeal as a \"continuation of a very cynical attempt to abuse the process of the court\" and criticized Netto for seeking to suppress the prison\\'s independent medical records. The judgement was reserved, and while awaiting the verdict, the rights groups continually sought clemency for Nagaenthran, who still remained at Changi Prison awaiting his fate.Four weeks later, on 29 March 2022, the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, and they issued harsh words of condemnation and criticism towards Netto and M. Ravi for abusing the court process. As he delivered the verdict on behalf of the judges, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon pointed out that the appeal was filed based on inadmissible evidence and Ravi\\'s own \"self-serving\" speculation that Nagaenthran has a mental age below 18 years old; there was no evidence to show any deterioration of Nagaenthran\\'s mental faculties during his 13-year stay on Changi Prison\\'s death row. The Court, relying on the findings of the trial court, accepted that Nagaenthran possessed borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. The two foreign psychologists\\' evidence was rejected as they did not personally assess Nagaenthran.Chief Justice Menon further pointed out that the Attorney-General\\'s Chambers had intended to enter psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021 as evidence in court, but Nagaenthran\\'s lawyers objected on the grounds of medical confidentiality, preventing the reports from being used as evidence. Menon questioned how Nagaenthran could withhold evidence regarding his medical condition after \"having called his medical condition into question\". Menon inferred that Nagaenthran was \"seeking to prevent the court from accessing that evidence because he knows or believes it would undermine his case\".Menon reprimanded the lawyers for mounting a baseless legal challenge against Nagaenthran\\'s death penalty, which he described as \"without merit\" and an attempt to escape from death and defer his imminent execution. He also reiterated that it was improper to engage in or encourage last-minute attempts to reopen any concluded appeals without a reasonable basis, and as long as the capital punishment was imposed legally in the specified circumstances, it is intolerable for a defence counsel to repeatedly launch hopeless appeals and bring the justice system into disrepute.Menon also stated in the appeal verdict: In our judgment, these proceedings constitute a blatant and egregious abuse of the court\\'s processes. They have been conducted with the seeming aim of unjustifiably delaying the carrying into effect of the sentence imposed on the appellant. Having lost his final chance to have his death sentence commuted, 33-year-old Nagaenthran was set for imminent execution. Nagaenthran\\'s family were reportedly devastated and shocked to hear the appeal\\'s dismissal. Second clemency appeal and outcome. In the aftermath of the appeal\\'s dismissal, many civil groups still tried to appeal to Singapore to commute Nagaenthran\\'s sentence and show him mercy. Maya Foa, director of UK-based anti-death penalty group Reprieve, made a statement to Singapore\\'s President Halimah Yacob, \"We urge \\u202fPresident Halimah Yacob to listen to the cries for mercy within Singapore and around the world, from the United Nations to global business leaders, and spare\\u202fthe life of this vulnerable man.\" Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) also accused the government of Singapore for violating international law and they also claimed that by sentencing Nagaenthran to death, Singapore had failed to abide by the conditions of prohibiting the killing of intellectually disabled persons. Together with M Ravi, LFL asked the Malaysian government to bring forward Nagaenthran\\'s case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Global Commission on Drug Policy, citing the case of Nagaenthran, stated that the death penalty was an inappropriate response to any offences, including drug-related crimes. A protest was also made on 3 April 2022 at Hong Lim Park against the government\\'s use of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran\\'s failed appeal. Besides, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran\\'s case and other death penalty issues from Singapore, as well as advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in the ASEAN member nations.While some netizens felt that Nagaenthran should be spared from the gallows and the death penalty should be removed, others agreed with and supported the judges\\' standing that Nagaenthran clearly knew the magnitude and consequences of his crime and stated he should face execution for his crime. Earlier in the same month Nagaenthran lost his appeal, a 2021 survey result was publicly revealed and it showed that more than 80% of Singaporeans believed that the death penalty should remain in Singapore due to its deterrent effect and relevance in fighting crime.M Ravi told the reporters that due to the complete exhaustion of avenues of appeal on Malaysia\\'s part, no more appeals would be lodged and the execution could take place in days, but he continued to express his support for Nagaenthran\\'s life to be spared. The concern that Nagaenthran\\'s execution would take place soon was further intensified when 68-year-old Changi Prison inmate Abdul Kahar bin Othman, a Singaporean drug convict, was confirmed to be executed at dawn on 30 March 2022, making Abdul Kahar the first person to be hanged in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.On 16 April 2022, rights advocate Kokila Annamalai revealed in a Malaysian newspaper that a second clemency appeal submitted by Nagaenthran\\'s family and supporters was rejected by the President of Singapore on 31 March 2022. Having personally witnessed the tender, loving moments between Nagaenthran and his family members during their prison visits and court session, Annamalai shared her sadness towards Nagaenthran for his imminent fate and she stated that there should be more to be done regarding the issue of capital punishment in Singapore, and criticised Singapore for a lack of mercy on Nagaenthran. The Guardian and Malaysian newspapers also confirmed that Nagaenthran\\'s death sentence was upheld by the dismissal of his second clemency plea, and Ravi criticised the decision to reject clemency on Nagaenthran. Second death warrant. On 20 April 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) informed Nagaenthran\\'s mother that her son\\'s execution was rescheduled to take place on 27 April 2022, and that extended daily visits would be facilitated for the family until the eve of his execution. This announcement led to requests for the Malaysian government to delay Nagaenthran\\'s execution by taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Upon receiving her son\\'s second death warrant, Nagaenthran\\'s mother Panchalai Supermaniam appeared on Facebook in a video clip, in which she made a public apology on behalf of her son, and she begged for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran\\'s life.By then, Amnesty International also filed a petition to seek clemency on behalf of Nagaenthran, and the petition itself garnered more than 8,000 signatures. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran\\'s family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran\\'s life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran\\'s sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran\\'s execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran\\'s execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa\\'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran\\'s family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran\\'s cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran\\'s case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy\\'s family similarly stood by Nagaenthran\\'s family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men\\'s executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men\\'s mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran\\'s case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran\\'s execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government\\'s decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran\\'s mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son\\'s rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran\\'s execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran\\'s execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran\\'s mother\\'s lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be \"devoid of merit\". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that \"no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum\" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: \"There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word.\" Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a \"calculated attempt\" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran\\'s mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran\\'s prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran\\'s mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to \"stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice.\"After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: \"I\\'d like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I\\'m placing this request so I can hold my family members\\' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members\\' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?\"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit\\'s rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of \"harassing\" and \"intimidating\" Nagaenthran\\'s mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore\\'s two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran\\'s 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother\\'s body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations. Nagaenthran\\'s 36-year-old sister Sharmila said that the family was saddened and shocked at their loss, and they were dissatisfied with Nagaenthran\\'s final sentence despite coming to terms with his death. The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran\\'s execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran\\'s sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran\\'s remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh. Over 200 family members and friends were present at the funeral. Reportedly, Sharmila did not allow a single politician to attend the funeral, claiming they\\'re coming only for publicity but did not offer assistance while Nagaenthran was on death row.In the year 2022 itself, a total of eleven executions, including Nagaenthran\\'s, were officially carried out in Singapore, all for drug trafficking. Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve\\'s director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran\\'s execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran\\'s family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran\\'s case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran\\'s family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran\\'s execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a \"disgraceful act\" which was \"ruthlessly carried out\" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran\\'s execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran\\'s execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan\\'s execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice. Bailes also stated in his own words, \"Witnesses, juries and courts make mistakes, but the death penalty once carried out is irreversible.\" The case of Nagaenthran also brought to attention the past cases of Australians executed for drug offences in Southeast Asian countries (e.g. Barlow and Chambers execution in Malaysia, Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore, and both Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Bali Nine in Indonesia) and Australia\\'s public opposition against the death penalty.The case of Nagaenthran\\'s execution brought attention to the cases of the nine remaining Malaysians (including Datchinamurthy Kataiah and Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) on Singapore\\'s death row, as well as four other Malaysians hanged for drug trafficking prior to Nagaenthran\\'s execution. The risk of execution of these nine Malaysians despite being alleged couriers or allegedly disabled brought concern to the activists who opposed the death penalty. The United Nations also criticised Singapore for executing Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman and stated that Singapore should impose a moratorium as a first step to abolish the death penalty, and urged Singapore to not execute Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was the third drug trafficker facing imminent execution in Singapore. Government\\'s response. On the same day Nagaenthran was executed, the Attorney-General\\'s Chambers (AGC) made an official statement, in which they strongly condemned the allegations and rumours spread in relation to Nagaenthran\\'s case, especially those seeking to \"cast aspersions\" on the involvement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, in which these rumours falsely suggested any form of bias made by Menon in his judgement in Nagaenthran\\'s appeal. The AGC commented that the lawsuit against Menon was the seventh legal application (not including appeals) made on behalf of Nagaenthran, and they described the lawsuit as \"the latest attempt to abuse the court\\'s processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran.\"The AGC also mentioned that prior to the lawsuit, it was specifically mentioned to Nagaenthran\\'s counsel about Chief Justice Menon\\'s appointment as the Attorney General during the prosecution of Nagaenthran, and Nagaenthran himself, under his lawyer\\'s advice, made no objections for Menon to preside the lawsuit. However, this information appeared to be \"deliberately\" withheld from Nagaenthran\\'s mother when she brought forward the lawsuit, since Nagaenthran\\'s mother had filed the application with the help of friends and activists, the organisations of legal papers clearly were not solely the work of Nagaenthran\\'s mother, and both the signature and email address did not belong to Nagaenthran\\'s mother. Therefore, for these above reasons, there was no basis at all in making the application. The AGC responded in the official statement that these allegations amounted to \"contempt of the court\", and reiterated that it \"takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice\".On 28 April 2022, the day after Nagaenthran\\'s execution, both the AGC and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) made statements to defend Singapore\\'s decision to hang Nagaenthran in light of the international condemnation of Singapore and the execution. The AGC reiterated in a statement that Nagaenthran was given a fair trial and had \"exhausted his rights of appeal and almost every other recourse under the law over some 11 years\", while the CNB said in a separate statement that Nagaenthran\\'s actions when committing the crime was \"a deliberate, purposeful and calculated decision\" and cited the related court findings, in which the judges all agreed that \"he knew what he was doing\" at the time of the offence.The CNB also said that there were too much misinformation spread about Nagaenthran\\'s mental state, and they reiterated that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled at the time of his offence since he had tried to evade the authorities and also narrated too many inconsistent accounts of how and what led to him committing the offences. The government\\'s stand received support from many who discussed the case.On 29 April 2022, it was revealed that three days before Nagaenthran\\'s execution, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan had both responded to their Malaysian counterparts that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process under the law when they received the government\\'s letter to review Nagaenthran\\'s case and sentence. Malaysia\\'s foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah replied to the Singapore government in a statement that they acknowledged Nagaenthran\\'s execution and this issue would not affect the diplomatic ties between Malaysia and Singapore, as they uphold their respect for the sovereignty rights of Singapore to decide on its own judicial system and laws.In response to the United Nations\\' criticism of Singapore, Ambassador Umej Bhatia defended the government\\'s decisions to execute Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman, as well as their use of the death penalty on drugs. Bhatia stated that all criminal proceedings in Singapore were conducted with due process before an \"impartial and independent judiciary\", and the death penalty would be passed on any suspect if their guilt were proven according to the law. He drew attention to Singapore\\'s decades-long reputation for having a fair and impartial criminal justice system, and an independent and effective judiciary. Bhatia rebutted that there was no racial discrimination in response to the allegations of racial bias over the large number of minorities on Singapore\\'s death row, and he cited that all individuals were subjected to equal and fair treatment under the laws of Singapore and were not given different treatment based on race or nationality. Bhatia reiterated that there was no need to impose a moratorium since there was no international consensus against the use of the death penalty \"when it is imposed according to the due process of law\", and added there was \"no explicit definition\" under international law or international consensus on what constitutes the \"most serious crimes\". Bhatia ended off his statement by citing that every country has its sovereign right to determine its own criminal justice system, considering its own circumstances and in accordance with its international law obligations.With regards to Nagaenthran\\'s case and the abuse of court processes made by Nagaenthran\\'s lawyers, Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim stated that they accepted there were bound to be some liberal citizens harbouring passionate views towards capital punishment but he reiterated that there should be basic respect given to the law and it was unacceptable for individuals to repeatedly launch appeals in an concluded capital case without tangible evidence. He also said that there would be legislative changes made and passed to stem down and issue penalties for every abuse of court processes. In addition, Faishal also highlighted the negative effects of drug abuse and how it may not only ruin the lives of drug abusers (and their loved ones) but also lead to crimes committed by suspects under the influence of drugs, citing the recent March 2022 cases of the Buangkok Crescent sword attack, the Queenstown knife attack of two people and the fatal police shooting of a knife-wielding fugitive drug abuser as examples to support his case. He stated that the war on drugs would continue on in Singapore in spite of the growing liberal attitudes of some young people towards drug use. HARDtalk interview. During a June 2022 BBC HARDtalk interview, Shanmugam, who was asked by the host and journalist Stephen Sackur regarding the death penalty, stated that the death penalty in Singapore was the right punishment adopted by the government to protect Singaporeans and save lives. He also cited a 2021 report by the World Health Organization (WHO) that showed there were 500,000 deaths linked to drug abuse in just one year. Shanmugam added that in the 1990s, Singapore was arresting about 6,000 people a year for drugs, but this has now dropped to about 3,000 people a year.. He stated that it goes to show that the laws deployed by Singapore on drug trafficking had safeguarded the lives of many locals and maintains a safe society in Singapore. Turning to Sackur\\'s question about the morals behind the execution of Nagaenthran despite his alleged disability, Shanmugam rebutted that the courts found Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled – which was confirmed by the psychiatrists called by his lawyers – and had made a calculated and calibrated decision to bring the drugs into Singapore. He also cited two cases of executed Americans with similar IQs like Nagaenthran to show there was no difference between Nagaenthran and the two men.Stating that Sackur should not focus on the execution of one trafficker but on the bigger picture of Southeast Asia\\'s severe drug situation (which caused countless fatalities among drug abusers in the region), Shanmugam quoted: \"To misquote a well-known quote, a single hanging of a drug trafficker is a tragedy; a million deaths from drug abuse is a statistic. That\\'s what this shows.\" The death penalty response by Shanmugam during the BBC interview was well-received and supported by many members of the public on social media. Other responses. The opposition parties in Singapore - Reform Party, People\\'s Power Party and Red Dot United - went on to write to Law Minister K Shanmugam, due to their concerns about the allegations of a climate of fear among lawyers, in the face of possible government reprisal, being discouraged from representing drug traffickers on death row, following the cases of Nagaenthran (through his mother\\'s application) and Datchinamurthy where both had to be present without legal counsel. The three opposition parties wrote that these claims were serious allegations as everyone is equally entitled to the right to legal representation under Singapore law, and they hoped that the government could undertake measures to quell these allegations for fear it may cause damage to Singapore\\'s reputation.In a May 2022 litigation conference, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon cited the increasing trend of multiple baseless legal applications made by many inmates against the death penalty, especially Nagaenthran\\'s case where he expressed his concern about the blatant abuse of court processes. He called on to all lawyers in Singapore to not engage in such procedures, as regardless of the lawyers\\' duty to the client or other reasons, the courts cannot countenance such clear abuse of process as it breached the responsibility of legal officers to the court. Legal proceedings against Nagaenthran\\'s former counsel. On 10 May 2022, it was reported that Violet Netto, the lawyer who represented Nagaenthran in his second-last appeal to the Court of Appeal, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer and solicitor without a valid practising certificate on at least three occasions, including Nagaenthran\\'s case and the last-ditch appeals of another two death row inmates Pausi Jefridin and Roslan Bakar. It was decreed under the law that solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year they act in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and Netto\\'s certificate was expired at the time she represented Nagaenthran. For this, she potentially faced the maximum sentence of six months\\' jail, a S$2,500 fine, or both if convicted of acting as a lawyer without a valid certificate.Not only that, M Ravi, the human rights lawyer who also represented Nagaenthran before Netto, was subjected to seven separate professional disciplinary inquiries which may result in him being fined, suspended or struck off the Bar as a lawyer, in addition to three contempt proceedings as well as a number of police investigations for the repeated abuse of court processes through Nagaenthran\\'s case. Ravi was also given a travel ban which restricted him from going to Malaysia. Due to these above proceedings against Nagaenthran\\'s former lawyers, the rights groups and Malaysian lawyers criticised Singapore for supposed harassment of lawyers and stated that Singapore should respect the criminals\\' rights to legal representation, since Nagaenthran\\'s mother and another prisoner Datchinamurthy Kataiah find themselves, in two separate cases, without the representation of legal counsel to argue their cases.On 25 May 2022, the Court of Appeal released a court order, in which they ruled that Ravi and Netto should pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General\\'s Chambers (AGC) as compensation to the unnecessary costs incurred by the lawsuits both lawyers made without solid evidence in Nagaenthran\\'s case; Ravi was to bear 75% of the total cost while the remaining 25% would be covered by Netto. A small-scale public funding event was carried out to gather funds to help Ravi and Netto to discharge their fine; some activists criticised Singapore for punishing the two lawyers for merely fulfilling their duties for their former client. Also, Ravi, who also need to pay S$10,000 and S$12,000 for another two lawsuits separately, remained defiant and unapologetic, stating that he paid a heavy price in saving lives from capital punishment despite the government\\'s condemnation of his errors. Police probe of activists. On 27 June 2022, it was reported that several people including activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated by police for illegally organising three public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit to show their opposition to the death penalty and support for drug traffickers Abdul Kahar Othman and Nagaenthran before their executions on 30 March 2022 and 27 April 2022 respectively. Han and Howe were also asked by police to submit their anti-death penalty slogan shirts, handphones and other possessions as evidence for upcoming police investigations. Passing of the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill. In the aftermath of Nagaenthran\\'s execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran\\'s case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate\\'s execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal. The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022. While this law was supported by most like Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, there were criticisms from Human Rights Watch that Singapore did so to cut off inmates\\' chances to oppose their execution and access to last chances of justice.

      "{'input': ' Background: London\\'s cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London\\'s livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel—as in its repeal of the Corn Laws—had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases—had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically naïve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy—a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river\\'s north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide. At low tides the water depth was at least 12 feet (3.7 m), thought to be sufficient for most steamers. These piers still stand today, though they have been interconnected.. The architect was Sir Horace Jones, designer of Smithfield Market and Tower Bridge. Since time was short, Jones took a minimalist approach. The site was not cleared: the existing dockyard buildings were preserved and adapted as necessary. The dockyard had a tidal basin surrounded by three ship-building sheds, each as lofty as Charing Cross station (see title image). By connecting these together Jones obtained a cattle lairage building comprising a pentagonal horseshoe with open sides facing the river and the landing piers (see Layout).  To the east another lairage shed had its own pier.  Animals were provided with water troughs and hay racks, and the lairs were brilliantly lighted at night by gas lamps.  There was enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep.  Later it was enlarged, and could accommodate 8,500 cattle and 20,000 sheep.  Admiralty storehouses were converted into abattoirs, comprising some 70 slaughterhouses.The demise of the old naval dockyard was regretted by many, and some features dating to Henry VIII were preserved.  By order of the City officials, a board was put up bearing the following inscription: \"Here worked as a ship-carpenter Peter, Czar of all the Russias, afterwards Peter the Great, 1698.\" \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. The market was opened for business in January 1872. In 1871 nearly half of cattle and sheep imported into the UK had been sold live at Islington, but by 1880 most were slaughtered at Deptford. Market life. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall.  Services inside included bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and the market\\'s own pub, the Peter the Great. Trading. It was not an auction market.  Trading was by private bargain, and in live animals only.  Exporters consigned cattle, sheep and pigs to salesmen who worked on commission.  Salesmen and buyers intermingled around the animal pens. Market days were Mondays and Thursdays, but there was nothing to stop animals being sold in their lairs on other days, and this was often done, especially when a shipload arrived late.. Weighbridges were seldom used: it was a matter of professional pride that cattle weights were guesstimated.  A journalist described it for Australian readers:The buyer runs over the lot, say, twenty or fifty, averaging the weights by calculation, and then offers a price, which is of course contemptuously rejected at first. By a gradual process of approximation the difficulty is got over, and a shake of the hand, or other mysterious sign, indicates the purchase of £1000 worth of beef. The buyers were wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers, who had access to slaughterhouse space on the premises, generally renting it by the year. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law; the buyers took away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces: most of the meat they resold at Smithfield.  By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London\\'s live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).  Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations — that animals need not be put up for sale on market days — to bypass the marketing system altogether.  See The Beef Trust, below.. Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford. Cattle boats. Cattle boats from the Continent — over a thousand a year — came up the Thames on Sundays and Wednesdays.As the transatlantic cattle trade developed (see below), large ocean-going cattle steamers came into use, but these were reluctant to come alongside.  Accordingly the market purchased three paddle steamers (named Racoon, Taurus and Claude Hamilton) into which cattle were transshipped at Gravesend.  Between them, those vessels conveyed more than 1.6 million animals to Deptford. Jack the Ripper, Deptford cattle boat man. One of the many theories about Jack the Ripper was that he was a Portuguese cattle attendant on a boat from Porto.  When it docked at Deptford, a Whitechapel murder ensued, or so insisted a customs official who claimed to see a statistical correlation.  His persistence irritated the police, but his theory was noticed by Queen Victoria.  \"The Queen fears the Detective Department is not as efficient as it might be...  Have the cattle boats & passenger boats been examined?\" Veterinary. On landing, animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon who took their pulse and temperature.  Suspects were set aside for observation.  If one animal in a cargo was found to be contagious, it was slaughtered at once and its carcase sterilised by steam in an iron digester; its companions were put with the suspects.  Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal\\'s home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.  The Essex man, needing a good steed, had been induced by a glowing advertisement to pay £30 for a horse, viewable at Deptford Market.  He did not realise it was in no condition to be ridden away. George Philcox. To find a superintendent for the market the City interviewed 25 candidates, and chose a 28-year old Southend station-master, George Philcox.  Philcox was in charge of the market for the next 40 years; when he died in 1912, it soon closed.  Apparently an able and popular man, it was said \"The market made him, and in turn he made it\". Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth\\'s researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. There is a record of market workers sending a wreath to the funeral of George Joseph Cooper MP, admired because at one time Argentina was put on the blacklist and he had tried very hard to get it removed.  In 1924, years after the market had closed, efforts were still being made to get it re-opened. Drovers. It was their job to drive the animals off the boats, or to transship them from the transatlantic steamers at Gravesend.   Nearly all the drovers begin their life in the market as \"ochre boys\", that is, boys who mark the animals with ochre for the butchers, and who are paid a few pence for so doing.  When they get old enough, and begin to pick up the drover\\'s craft, they apply to the City Corporation for a licence, which is granted on satisfactory proof of good character on the payment of a fee of 5s, and is annually renewable without further payment.. Drovers at Deptford market were paid a lump sum per vessel, George Philcox told Booth.  They could unload a cattle boat in as little as 15 minutes. Some cattle, especially from Argentina, were very wild, and were best given \"a wide berth\". A man in regular employment could earn as much as £4 a week (about £520 purchasing power in 2018 money). Slaughtermen. These men, who killed and butchered the animals, worked in gangs of four, and earned very high wages for the era: £5 (≅ £6502018) a week was not uncommon. No slaughtering was done on Saturdays; on other days it varied according to demand, and for a rush order might last up to 20 hours on end.  The work was said to be brutalising \"and conducive to drink\".A carefully aimed blow at the head with a poleaxe was the usual method of stunning used in Britain.  While The Times reported favourably on the relative humanity practised at Deptford, it came from the skill acquired by regular repetition; it was not infallible.  A tanner, examining the lesions on a sample 100 cattle hides — albeit not from Deptford — noted that 45% showed signs of more than one blow i.e., they were not stunned by the first stroke.  An advocate of the Jewish shechita method (which was also used at the market) said that he had observed that it often took five blows to fell an ox at Deptford.That women slaughtered animals at Deptford is not supported by reliable sources. Women: the gut girls. One of the most unpleasant jobs was cleaning cattle and sheep intestines, which were used for making sausage skins (and, according to a later source, condoms).  Originally men\\'s work, in about 1891 they went on strike for more pay: management responded by assigning the work to women.. Some 80-100 women and girls, aged 14 to 40, were employed daily; they worked for two firms that had contracted to buy all the gut offal from the market\\'s slaughterhouses.  Writing for the Daily Telegraph, \"A Lady Visitor\", who claimed to have smelled some vile odours in her time, said the stink was insupportable.  Tubs of unwashed entrails were coarsely de-fatted by men. The women\\'s share in the ugly business begins when the greasy, slimy intestinal skins [many yards long] come to them for the scraping off of all fat and substance still attaching to them. This work was done by a first group who cleaned off the outside, made the gut into a figure of eight rope, and tossed it to a second.  The second group, armed with a powerful watercock, turned the gut inside out and washed it ready for the sausage makers.  In winter the water nearly froze the hands.. They made 12s to 14s (≅  £77 to £892018) a week which, for women\\'s work, was good pay.For some reason Queen Victoria took an interest in the Deptford market, and she asked her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Albany, to look into the working conditions of the girls there.  The Duchess of Albany went down to Deptford, saw the work, was horrified, and complained in high places.  It turned out that the gut firms had been processing, not just the entrails from Deptford market, but huge quantities brought in from outside.  The City\\'s markets committee, finding out, banned it as a health risk.  The result was that the women became unemployed, and a charity, the Deptford Fund, had to be started to support them.  The stage play The Gut Girls by Sarah Daniels is a fictionalised version of this incident.. Years later the Duchess of Albany\\'s daughter (aged 95) told the BBC:I never knew such cheerful people.  They were very, very gay.  Very unruly, terribly unruly, bad girls.  If they came down dancing their can-can and you were in the way, you\\'d be swept off.  They could be horrid. . Despite this, it appears that most women tried to conceal their employment at the market. Deptford as an international livestock market. Over the years roughly half of London\\'s meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on. From Europe. Early days. Describing the pull of London as a meat market for European farmers, Richard Peet said \"It was as though a city of several million people were located just off the Dutch coast\".  A journalist, visiting Deptford market in 1889, reported:From July to December the imports are greatest from the Northern Dutch and Baltic ports; from January to June the trade is briskest from Flushing and the Belgian ports; all the year round Germany sends us sheep from Bremen and Hamburg, and Spain and Portugal send cattle from Vigo and Oporto.. The Spanish cattle were \"beautiful chestnut brown in colour, sleek and well-built, though rather depressed in look, as Spanish cattle always are\".Some animals had more distant origins. Forrest Capie and Richard Perren said that, although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were [just] the terminal stations of a great network of main German railway lines and branch lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia and extended right up to Bessarabian frontier. In the 1860s the Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before they reached their port of embarkation. . Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.  The Russian capital was more than 30° to the east of Deptford, and these animals may have come from much further still, since Saint Petersburg oblast raised few export-grade cattle.  They may have been driven to market from south Russia.  In 1872 the Russian Empire was blacklisted for cattle plague and no more Russian cattle could be landed, even at Deptford. Demise of European cattle trade. The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s — except for Iceland — after the British authorities faced the fact that too much livestock was really coming from places where disease was endemic \"and the provincial authorities made no attempt to stamp it out\". For example Prussia had stringent laws against animal disease but \"the profits from smuggling cattle from Poland are too enticing.By then the United States had become the main supplier. From the United States. Of all the cattle ever landed at Deptford market, the largest proportion came from the U.S.A.  The practice started in 1878 when American cattle and pigs were \"scheduled\" for port slaughter. By 1913, when Deptford had closed, 3,144,400 American cattle had been landed there, besides sheep and pigs.Nearly all American livestock exports went to England. Americans sent livestock to England because they had a surplus that could not be absorbed by local demand.  When, eventually, it was, which happened by 1913, exportation ceased.  Writing in 1915, two senior American officials said: \"Our beef surplus has vanished and our own people now require all that our farms and ranches produce\". Upgrading livestock in the American West. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West.  But early Western cattle e.g. Texas longhorns, though hardy, made tough eating.  It cost exactly the same to ship a top quality steer from New York to London as a gristly one.  Consequently, it made economic sense for American shippers to export their best animals, as better able to absorb the cost of carriage. At first, export-grade cattle were to be found in the East only, where cattle breeds were similar to those of the British Isles.  British farmers were advised not to worry about imported Western livestock for the present, because it would not compete on quality.  But (as predicted) Western cattlemen realised they could capture lucrative markets by improving their stock — and did so.  The English export trade contributed to the demand for more and better cattle.Stockmen found profitable the exportation of only the choicest grade cattle and attained this quality by upgrading the range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood...  The trade therefore became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.   Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.  \"On the western plains the ranches that succeeded the open range bought high priced sires with which to upgrade their old stock. The upturn in the quality of beef animals, with younger cattle going to the feedlot, meant better beef from the slaughter house and on the family table, all part of a general improvement\". It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.  By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. Distances. Already in 1880 The Times was advising its readers that a 1,200 pounds (540 kg) steer from (say) Colorado, Wyoming or Montana could be conveyed to Deptford market — over 2,000 miles of land and 3,000 of ocean — for £10 or £12. It included cowboys\\' wages, rail fare, shipping freight and the landing charges at Deptford (which, thought the author, were rather extortionate).  All this added only 4d a pound to the carcase price of beef (≅£4.40 a kilo2018).Scientific American reported that, recently, five cattle-laden steamers had sailed from New York to England in one day.  The cattle in this new trade \"come principally from Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado\".. Some cattle came to Deptford from as far away as Oregon, though this was sporadic.  The English adventurer Moreton Frewen, writing to The Times, saidCroma, due at Deptford Saturday, the 25th, has on board a hundred fat bullocks, the first consignment of western American cattle that have as yet taken advantage of the cheap transportation afforded by the Great Lakes. The majority of them were bred by myself and brother in Wyoming in 1881, but some few which can be distinguished by their brand ... are from far distant Oregon, and, having walked through from there to Wyoming in 1882, were purchased by me at the end of their long march.  It is [remarkable] that beasts calved more than 6,000 miles away on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, matured in Wyoming and fattened on Lake Superior, should have been destined after crossing the Atlantic on the hoof, to \"terminate their engagements\" in the Thames. Significance to the West. The exportation of cattle to England had a discernible impact on the American livestock industry.  While not all American exports went to Deptford, London was the most important market.  Wrote John P. Huttman:The impact of foreign demand for U.S. meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds\". As noted, the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.. Further, some British agriculturalists, shielded until recently from American competition — first by distance, then by quality issues — found it attractive to go in for American ranching themselves. They \"fought competition at its source and engaged directly in American ranching, until by 1884 it was estimated that \\'one-sixth of all our herds are now owned by Englishmen\\'\".  And British investors, attracted by the fabulous profits sometimes realised in the West, made an important contribution to its development. From Canada. A major export industry at the time, range cattle came from Alberta and Assiniboia and went east on the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The St. Lawrence River route meant that cattle started the voyage in calm waters and comparatively cool weather. \"Most of the losses of cattle in shipments from Atlantic ports were due to delay and neglect prior to shipping and occurred during the first few days of the crossing\".  For many years Canadian livestock was considered disease-free and could be landed freely, but it was scheduled for slaughter at Deptford from 1892 on.  It did western ranchers little harm:The movement of high quality to the British market continued unabated. These great range-bred cattle had to be slaughtered within the port holding pens anyway, because they were too wild to ship conveniently to provincial butchers.Exports to England rose from 115,000 cattle in 1900 to 160,000 in 1905, but petered out after a severe winter depleted half the range-cattle industry\\'s working capital. From Argentina. As the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford\\'s main supply of animals came from Argentina.  Formerly, Argentine cattle \"were of an inferior breed, their chief characteristics being thick hides and well-developed horns\"; they were slaughtered locally for their hides, bones and tallow. Two things transformed the Argentine beef industry into the greatest exporter in the world: selective breeding and alfalfa (lucerne) forage.From about 1888 live cattle and sheep were shipped as deck cargo from Buenos Aires, carpenters knocking up temporary stalls and pens.  Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.  Progressive Argentine cattlemen were keenly aware that quality was important, and they paid large prices for Shorthorn bulls to improve their herds.   Such was the demand for export-grade cattle in 1903 that an American agent told his government \"it is extremely difficult to get a good piece of beef in the city of Buenos Aires\".  \"Wild, untamed brutes\" did badly on the sea journey, and had to be tamed in advance and taught to eat hay.Deptford was closed to Argentine cattle and sheep in 1900 for foot-and-mouth, and briefly re-opened in 1903.  Thereafter there was scant incentive to revive the live meat trade on these very long journeys.  From about 1900 good chilled Argentine beef was a more satisfactory alternative. Severe unemployment came to Deptford. From Australia and New Zealand. At the end of the Victorian era cattle and sheep were shipped to Deptford Market from as far away as Victoria (Australia), New South Wales, Queensland, and Dunedin, New Zealand.. The first commercial (though experimental) shipment was from Sydney on the steamer Maori King, a 67-day voyage which went around Cape Horn in winter — presumably to avoid the heat of the Suez Canal.  The cattle landed at Deptford in September 1894, but sold at a heavy loss.  Next year there was a much more successful voyage by Port Pirie: one animal died of heat in the Red Sea, but the others arrived in excellent condition (see illustration).  Another success was 250 sheep per Banffshire from Dunedin; only one was lost.. However, as shipments continued there were \"terrible\" losses.  For these ambitious voyages more than halfway round the world, excellent planning and execution were essential, but were wanting. The Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, clapped an extinguisher on the trade. The vessel left the port on November 22, 1895, and arrived at Deptford on February 9, 1896, with 32 animals [alive], some of which were in a maimed condition. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took the matter up, and the Board of Agriculture inspected the ship and issued an order prohibiting the Angers from carrying live stock from or to any port in Great Britain for a twelvemonth.. Altogether in the Australasian live trade, 607 cattle were lost out of 2,654 shipped, and 57 out of 3,882 sheep. The Beef Trust. The Beef Trust was a cartel of the large Chicago meat packers.  Acting in collusion they allocated market shares and fixed meat prices in the United States, eventually coming under attack by \"trust buster\" president Theodore Roosevelt.  As described in the next section, by 1900 the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America.. In the Edwardian era reputable newspapers claimed that  the Trust had bought up many shops in Smithfield Market;. they met every morning to fix the price of British beef;. they practically controlled the lairages at Deptford Market; but. instead of selling their Deptford cattle to buyers at that market, they sent the meat directly to Smithfield; with the result that, on a numerous occasions, market days at Deptford were cancelled for lack of support.As a result of persistent questioning by C. W. Bowerman, Labour MP for Deptford, Winston Churchill (the President of the Board of Trade) set up an inquiry into \"how far and in what manner the general supply, distribution and price of Meat in the United Kingdom are controlled or affected by any combination of firms or companies\".  The inquiry reported in 1909.  The allegations were generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom.  This was because, although it did indeed control the North Atlantic meat trade, American beef exports had declined, and large shipments of refrigerated beef were coming from Argentina. Animal welfare: journeys. Animals were sent from the grasslands of the world to be slaughtered at Deptford market.  Even today, when animal welfare is a consideration and the average journey from feedlot to slaughter plant lasts just a few hours, transport-related stress and injury are major sources of loss to the American meat industry.  According to Temple Grandin, fear, which motivates animals to avoid predators, is a very strong stressor during transport.  Animals unaccustomed to human beings are liable to be stressed more, and in that era of range cattle there were many.  An American special agent, reporting on the overseas shipping of untamed Argentine cattle (1904), said: The wild creatures wear themselves out trying to break away.  They are in  abject terror of everything near them, for they have never been restrained in any way before. Everything is new, and they do not understand that they will not be hurt, as the better trained animals do. They have never seen any dry food, and for days they do not eat. . In the Victorian era there was much publicity about the iniquities of transatlantic cattle ships.  Before crossing the Atlantic, however, most animals had endured journeys in cattle trains, sometimes travelling for a week or more.  A paper read before the American Veterinary Medical Association claimed that the train journeys had been overlooked, being as bad as the sea voyages if not worse. Transatlantic cattle ships. American cattle most often sailed from New York; also Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Portland.  Canadian cattle were shipped from the port of Montreal; Argentine cattle and sheep from the port of Buenos Aires. Early days. Sending cattle safely across the Atlantic demanded forward planning and knowhow.  Quite often these were lacking, especially in the early days, when conditions were \"very bad\", or \"little better than the horrors of \"the middle passage\" of the old slave trading days\". According to a government inquiry the worst culprits were tramp steamers, neither specialising in the trade nor built for it.  When freights were high these vessels were hastily rigged up with temporary decks and crammed tightly with cattle.Risk was greatest in winter, when insurance rates soared to 10% \"as a heavy storm may make it necessary to lighten the ship by throwing the entire deck load of cattle overboard\".In 1879 the British government\\'s chief veterinary officer reported on animals jettisoned from transatlantic cattle ships or dying on board from injury or suffocation.  Describing the losses as \"terrible\", he said 10,667 animals were thrown overboard, 1,210 were landed dead, and 718 were so badly injured or exhausted that they had to be slaughtered on landing. Samuel Plimsoll. In 1890 Samuel Plimsoll, having successfully campaigned for his Plimsoll line, turned to the transatlantic cattle trade.  He said it ought to be abolished.  In Cattle Ships he seized the reader\\'s attention thus: The Erin sailed from New York in December, 1889, with 527 cattle on board, for London, and has . never since been heard of; she had 74 men on board.. Plimsoll wrote that cattle ships were dangerously unstable in stormy weather, cruel to animals, and unnecessary.  They were unstable if cattle were carried on the upper deck or (worse) on a temporary, higher platform that raised the ship\\'s centre of gravity even further, and obstructed the crew in their duties.  Animals were washed overboard by heavy seas, or were deliberately jettisoned to save the vessel.  If carried down in the holds they could stifle to death after the hatches were battened down in bad weather.  Knowing this, captains sometimes took risks in leaving the hatches open.  Further, animals stood on their own dung, which could not be cleared away; on this slippery surface they fell about helplessly and were injured, often fatally.Plimsoll alleged that cattle attendants were not allowed to euthanise badly injured livestock, because the insurance companies would refuse to pay up.  Animals were left to die a lingering death.  Plimsoll was probably wrong about the insurance companies; but it made no difference, because the cattle attendants thought it was so and behaved accordingly.Another accusation was that cattle attendants used cruel methods to make animals get on their feet, such as piercing them with pitchforks, twisting their tails, beating them about the head with iron buckets, or pouring paraffin in their ears. \"Some of the men in charge, who are paid a percentage on the number of cattle they bring alive into Deptford, tortured the animals most fiendishly into a semblance of animation\".  It was indignantly denied by cattle shippers, who asked what they had to gain by such practices: cattle were free to lie down if they wanted to.  \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. The cattle attendants included foremen known as \"cowboys of the seas\", \"big burly fellows who are used to rough living and facing danger\"; also a despised class called \"stiffs\" who did the work for little or no pay just to get across the Atlantic.  Sometimes educated men e.g. Harvard students travelled as stiffs.  The poet W.H. Davies was a stiff and wrote about the harsh methods used to make the cattle stand up; so did an English solicitor returning from a working holiday to Canada.  It was done to stop animals tangling their head ropes, or being trampled to death by their fellows. Improvements. A government inquiry tended to confirm many of Plimsoll\\'s allegations.  Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile.  It was to the business advantage of shippers (hence, liners) that livestock arrive in the Thames on time and in excellent condition.  By 1892 North Atlantic animal losses were reduced to less than 1%, ten times better than on the Buenos Aires run.. Even in the good liners, however, the dung and urine were left to accumulate in the holds; the ammoniacal stench was said to be unbearable.  According to Scientific AmericanCattle on deck often have the seawater which comes on board frozen on their backs, and heavy rolls and pitches cause many broken legs. The average run from New York to the Thames was 11 days.  Cattle could scent land, sometimes setting up \"a united bellow\"  when thirty or forty hours from shore. Cattle trains. From the livestock-raising regions animals were taken to market by train, mostly to Chicago. onto which 17 railroads converged.  At the Chicago stockyards there was a special market for \"export grade\" cattle; these were railed to ports on the eastern seaboard for shipment to England.  The map also shows the Canadian Pacific Railway that took livestock from the foothills of the Rocky mountains to Montreal. Lengthy journeys. Animals were not supposed to travel more than 28 hours at a time, according to a U.S. federal law of 1873, after which they must be got off the train for water, food and 5 hours rest.  Quite often at these stops, however, the railroad companies, who were not very enthusiastic about the cattle trade, neglected to provide proper water or food, or there was nowhere to rest because the station stockyard was a sea of mud or a drift of snow.The 28-hour limit was widely ignored, and there was even something to be said for that, because repeatedly unloading and reloading the animals could do them more harm than leaving them on the train.  Thus in 1906 the law was amended to allow animals to be carried for up to 36 hours at a time if the owners agreed, and from now on the law was enforced\\'Palace\\' or \"parlor\" stock cars were special vehicles supposed to furnish water and hay for animals to consume en route, and hence exempted from the 28-hour law.  Thus they could and did run for 60 or even 100 hours at a time.  It seems that in reality, however, water and food were seldom supplied to these vehicles: some thought they were a sham. Overcrowding and injury. Shipping space was usually sold by the carload, so there was an incentive to cram in as many animals as possible to save freight charges, which were high.  Some held that tight packing was good for the animals because it stopped them fighting or lying down, or falling over when the engine jerked the train or when it went round a tight curve. If a steer did fall, or lay down to rest, there was a risk that it might never get up again.  Consequently cattle attendants, who travelled in the caboose, went round at intervals and, if they spotted a recumbent animal, tried to make it stand up.  For this purpose there was a special tool called a cattle prod which, if the steer was not actually dying, usually worked.  A stockman recalled: The toughest job I ever undertook was to start from the Missouri River and land a consignment of cattle in the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, without a loss. The first run was three hundred miles across the State of Iowa to the Mississippi River; it generally took thirty-six hours, two nights and a day. In loading cattle, on account of the freight charges, you naturally would get every steer in a car you could. The steers had \"standing room only\"; consequently, if a steer got down, which was a very common occurrence, on account of the fatigue from standing too long, it was either to get that steer on his feet again or he would be trampled to death, and away would go the profit on that car of cattle.. He described how:Sometimes you could raise him by standing alongside of the car and using your prod — a pole about six feet long with a sharp iron point in one end of it — but often you had to climb into the end window of the car and go right among them, horns, droppings, and all, and take your chances of ever getting out alive, the trainmen paying no attention to you, the train running thirty miles an hour, and maybe it is night and as dark as pitch. . A government official wrote: \"Under the present system not a train is brought to any great market without having many crippled beeves, and several dead ones\". In Canada. There was no 28-hour law in Canada and rail journeys were immense. The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was \"sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer\", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain \"gaunt and shrunken\". Whether economic justification for live cattle trade. Plimsoll\\'s case. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders.  He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not — namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently — as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it. A writer to The Times said:I know a family in this town of good position who after much anxious thought and weighing all the chances of being poisoned, &c, timorously resolved one day to try this American beef. Unfortunately, the servants heard of the great experiment. The joint, a fine one, was duly served; the family ate and liked it... But, would you believe it, Sir, not one of the four servants would touch it!  By the Edwardian era two authors said \"the West-End folk are very large customers for chilled beef of the highest quality\", which suggests it could be quite palatable.  However that may be, Plimsoll argued it was up to the customer to decide.  She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly — even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or £4 per head of cattle (≝ £5002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market\\'s trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that \"foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton\".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers\\' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free — it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

      "{'input': ' Inauguration. Youngkin was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2022. He took office alongside his Republican ticket mates, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, the first woman of color elected to statewide office in Virginia, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state. The Washington Post called this ticket \"historically diverse\" and reported that it was a sign of \"inroads\" made by the Republican Party \"in the African American and Latino communities.\" Former Democratic Governor of Virginia Douglas Wilder commented after the election that Republicans had \"one-upped\" Democrats with the historic achievement, which, he said, showed that Democrats \"can\\'t take the [Black] community for granted.\"Youngkin was inaugurated two years into the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. His first week in office coincided with the January 14–17, 2022 North American winter storm. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the morning before his inauguration, Youngkin participated in a community service project at \"the Reconciliation Statue along the Richmond Slave Trail in Shockoe Bottom, which was home to the second largest domestic slave market in the United States before the Civil War.\" Later that night, an inauguration eve party was held for Youngkin at the Omni Richmond Hotel. Another inauguration eve event for Youngkin was later held at the Science Museum of Virginia. On the night of his inauguration, Youngkin held a celebratory event at the Richmond Main Street Station.The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin\\'s inaugural address \"delivered the blend of religious confidence and boardroom bravado that powered his victory\", while The Associated Press characterized the address as one that carried \"a tone of bipartisanship and optimism\". The Washington Post noted that Youngkin used the address to criticize modern politics as \"too toxic\", but also wrote that, immediately after the address, Youngkin \"stirred partisan rancor\" by signing a series of polarizing executive actions. The publication noted that Youngkin\\'s praise for the COVID-19 vaccine \"fell flat with the largely mask-free crowd\". Along with NPR, it reported that Youngkin\\'s biggest applause was for a line about \"removing politics from the classroom\". Day One executive actions. After his inauguration, Youngkin signed eleven executive actions. The first of these bans the teaching of what it calls \"inherently divisive concepts\" and identifies critical race theory as one such concept. While critical race theory has been widely discussed by teachers at workshops sponsored by the Virginia Department of Education, it has never been endorsed by the department or included in the state\\'s public school curriculum. In his executive order, Youngkin characterized critical race theory and related concepts as \"political indoctrination\" that \"instruct students to only view life through the lens of race and presumes that some students are consciously or unconsciously racist, sexist, or oppressive, and that other students are victims.\" Frederick Hess, education policy director at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, approved of the order as \"sensible and thoughtful and well-written\".The Washington Post has noted that while critical race theory specifically refers to \"an academic framework that examines how policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism in the United States\", the term has been reappropriated by conservatives \"as a catchall symbolizing schools’ equity and diversity work.\" Youngkin\\'s stance on critical race theory has been condemned by leaders of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, and according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, has \"alarmed many educators\" in the state. Youngkin\\'s critics, the publication wrote, view the banning of critical race theory as an attempt to \"whitewash\" history and \"erase black history\".Two of the executive actions signed by Youngkin on his first day in office rescinded COVID-19 regulations that had been enacted by the previous administration; one of these actions rescinded Virginia\\'s statewide mask mandate for public schools and attempted to make compliance with local public school mask mandates optional; the other rescinded the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all state employees. Additionally, one of Youngkin\\'s Day One executive orders called for a reevaluation of the workplace safety standards that had been adopted by the Northam administration as a protection against COVID-19.The other executive actions taken by Youngkin on his first day in office were devoted to firing and replacing the entire Virginia Parole Board, calling for the state\\'s Attorney General to investigate the handling of sexual assaults that had recently occurred in the Loudoun County public school system, initiating reviews of the Virginia Parole Board, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Virginia Employment Commission, creating commissions to combat antisemitism and human trafficking, ordering state agencies under Youngkin\\'s authority to reduce nonmandatory regulations by 25%, and calling for the state to reevaluate its membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.The Washington Post noted that Youngkin\\'s first executive orders had gone \"far beyond the practice of his predecessors in the Executive Mansion over the past 20 years\", writing that while each of those predecessors had focused their first executive actions on \"less incendiary topics\", such as anti-discrimination protections and policy studies, Youngkin\\'s first executive actions, \"by contrast...poked a stick directly into a host of polarizing issues\". Former Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Bill Bolling, a Republican, condemned Youngkin\\'s repeal of public school mask mandates, saying that it introduced \"unnecessary controversy, confusion and litigation\" and calling it \"in direct conflict with an existing state law.\" The legality of Youngkin using an executive order to ban the teaching of critical race theory has also been called into question. VPM News reported that Youngkin\\'s critics view the order as \"unenforceable\". The Washington Post noted that no governor had \"banned critical race theory via executive order\" before Youngkin and predicted that any such order would face court challenges, writing that it was \"not clear\" whether Youngkin would be exceeding his legal authority by issuing such an order. Lawsuits. Two lawsuits were brought in January against Youngkin\\'s executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia. One of the lawsuits was brought by a group of parents from Chesapeake and the other was brought by seven of the state\\'s school boards. The lawsuits argued that Youngkin\\'s executive order infringed upon local control given to Virginia school boards by the state constitution and violated a state law requiring that Virginia public schools comply with CDCP health guidelines \"to the maximum extent practicable\". The ACLU, representing a group of medically vulnerable students in Virginia, brought an additional lawsuit in February, arguing that Youngkin\\'s policy violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against students who would be at high risk if infected by COVID-19. Youngkin called on Virginia parents to cooperate with school principals while the lawsuits proceeded.A majority of public school districts in Virginia refused to comply with the executive order and continued to enforce local mask mandates into February. On February 4, an Arlington County judge ruled to allow mask mandates to be temporarily retained in the seven school districts that had sued to stop Youngkin\\'s order while their case proceeded through the courts. Three days later, the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit brought by the group of parents from Chesapeake; the dismissal was for procedural reasons and did not rule on the legality of Youngkin\\'s executive order, nor did it overturn the ruling that had been issued that week in Arlington County. The same day that the Chesapeake lawsuit was dismissed, the Youngkin administration joined a lawsuit against the Loudoun County school system, brought by a group of parents in that county, who were challenging their school system\\'s decision to continue enforcing a mask mandate.School systems throughout Virginia began dropping their mask mandates in mid-February, after Youngkin signed a bill requiring that they do so by March 1. The ACLU expanded the scope of its lawsuit against the Youngkin administration to include this new law, and on March 23, 2022, a federal judge decided the lawsuit by ruling that school districts in Virginia could choose to require masking in areas frequented by the plaintiffs. The ruling did not overturn Youngkin\\'s executive order or the state law and only applies to school systems attended by the plaintiffs. Following an appeal by the Youngkin administration, a settlement was reached in December 2022. The settlement allows mask mandates under similar terms to those established by the March court ruling. Cabinet. Youngkin began announcing nominations for his sixteen-member cabinet on December 20, 2021, and did not finish the process until after his inauguration. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin assembled his cabinet at a slower pace than prior Virginia governors. Commenting on this process, the publication wrote in December 2021, \"The slow pace has turned the quadrennial parlor game of predicting Cabinet picks into a far more protracted and opaque process [than usual], with lobbyists, interest groups and other Richmond insiders left guessing what the new administration might look like. Youngkin’s practice of sidestepping many policy specifics during the campaign has only heightened the anticipation.\"Several news outlets noted that Youngkin\\'s focus on education as a campaign priority was reflected in his decision to begin announcing his cabinet nominees with his choice for Secretary of Education. Although Youngkin suggested while campaigning for the Republican gubernatorial nomination that he would name his then-opponent Kirk Cox, a former Speaker of the House of Delegates, to the position, he instead chose Aimee Rogstad Guidera, the founder of a data firm focused on fostering student achievement.Five of Youngkin\\'s cabinet nominees are women and three are African American. Many of his nominees were brought in from other states, and only a few of his nominees had any prior government experience. The Washington Post wrote of these nominees, \"Their newcomer status is on brand for Youngkin, who ran touting his lack of political experience as an asset. But it also presents the new administration with a steep learning curve.\"Four of Youngkin\\'s cabinet nominees served under previous Virginia governors: Youngkin\\'s Secretary of the Commonwealth nominee, Kay Coles James, served as Secretary of Health and Human Resources under Governor George Allen; Youngkin\\'s Secretary of Labor nominee, George Bryan Slater, served as Secretary of Administration under Governor Jim Gilmore; Youngkin\\'s Secretary of Health and Human Resources nominee, John Littel, served as Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Resources under Allen; and Youngkin\\'s Secretary of Transportation nominee, W. Sheppard “Shep” Miller III, served on the Commonwealth Transportation Board under Northam.Several of Youngkin\\'s cabinet nominees are from the private sector, while three – James, Littel, and Chief Diversity Officer Angela Sailor – worked for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. James was the first Black woman to serve as president of the foundation, Sailor was an executive there at the same time, and Littel worked there as a lawyer. Youngkin\\'s Secretary of Commerce nominee, Caren Merrick, served as Chief Executive of the Virginia Ready Initiative, described by The Washington Post as \"a nonprofit organization that Youngkin founded in 2020 to fund workforce training for people struggling during the economic shutdown linked to the coronavirus pandemic.\" Daniel Gade, who ran unsuccessfully as the Republican nominee in Virginia\\'s 2020 Senate election, was named by Youngkin as commissioner of Virginia\\'s Department of Veterans Services, serving under Youngkin\\'s Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Craig Crenshaw. Jeff Goettman, who served as a Treasury Department official in the Trump administration before becoming the chief operating officer of Youngkin\\'s campaign, was chosen by Youngkin to serve as chief of staff.For the role of counselor, a cabinet-level position, Youngkin chose Richard Cullen, an attorney described by The Washington Post as \"the ultimate Richmond insider\". Cullen had been chairman of McGuireWoods, and in the 1990s, served out the remainder of Jim Gilmore\\'s term as Attorney General of Virginia, after Gilmore resigned to run for governor. The Washington Post reported that Cullen\\'s appointment was \"widely seen as a nod to the establishment class\" and theorized that the choice \"could suggest that Youngkin does not intend to thoroughly disrupt \\'politics as usual\\' in a state where cozy ties between government and business interests have long been lauded – and derided – as \\'the Virginia way.\\'\" The publication further wrote, \"At the very least, the choice indicates that Youngkin wants an experienced political hand on his team as he tries to get his arms around the state’s sprawling bureaucracy.\" Chief Diversity Officer. Youngkin finished announcing his cabinet nominees on January 19, 2022, with his choice for Chief Diversity Officer. This position was established by Youngkin\\'s immediate predecessor, Ralph Northam, in response to a scandal involving racist imagery appearing on Northam\\'s medical school yearbook page – a scandal that nearly caused Northam to resign from office. The idea for a Chief Diversity Officer was born out of a commitment made by Northam to focus the remainder of his term on advancing racial equity in Virginia. Youngkin did not announce a nomination for Chief Diversity Officer until after his inauguration, which led to media speculation that he would be eliminating the position. Youngkin\\'s nominee for Chief Diversity Officer, Angela Sailor, was an executive at the Heritage Foundation and held multiple roles in George W. Bush\\'s presidential administration.Virginia\\'s Chief Diversity Officer oversees the state\\'s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which was designed under Northam to \"address systemic inequities\" existing within the state government. Upon announcing Sailor\\'s nomination to serve in his cabinet, Youngkin issued an executive order restructuring the agency. The order said that the agency would \"be an ambassador for unborn children\", devote resources towards emphasizing parental involvement in public school education, take an increased role in \"[assisting] Virginians living with disabilities and bringing Virginians of different faiths together\", elevate \"viewpoint diversity in higher education\", and focus on creating \"equal opportunity\" for every Virginian. Youngkin sought to rename the agency as the Office of Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion, but a legislative proposal to do so was voted down in the state senate. Andrew Wheeler nomination. Youngkin\\'s initial nominee for Secretary of Natural Resources, Andrew Wheeler, was voted down on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Wheeler had served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Trump administration, and before that, worked as a coal lobbyist. His tenure at the EPA was marked by reversals of environmental regulations that had been implemented by the Obama administration, and his nomination to serve in Youngkin\\'s cabinet was heavily criticized by environmental advocates. A letter signed by 150 former EPA employees was sent to the Virginia legislature expressing opposition to Wheeler\\'s nomination.As noted by The Washington Post, cabinet nominees almost always receive bipartisan support in Virginia state politics; although prior Virginia governor Bob McDonnell withdrew one of his cabinet nominees in response to Democratic opposition, only one cabinet nominee before Wheeler had ever been formally voted down by the Virginia state legislature – Daniel G. LeBlanc, an AFL–CIO chief whose nomination by Tim Kaine to serve as Secretary of the Commonwealth was rejected by Republicans in 2006. Wheeler served as acting Secretary of Natural Resources until mid-March 2022, when Youngkin appointed him as a senior advisor, a role that does not require confirmation by the legislature. In June of that year, Youngkin appointed Wheeler to direct the Office of Regulatory Management, an office newly established by Youngkin through executive order for the purpose of reducing state regulatory requirements. Just as Wheeler had done with his advisory role, he was able to assume his role at the Office of Regulatory Management without legislative approval.Leading up to the vote on Wheeler\\'s nomination to serve as Secretary of Natural Resources, Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates retaliated against Democrats for opposing the nomination, by both blocking the reappointment of a judge to the State Corporation Commission and leaving two Virginia Supreme Court vacancies open. After Wheeler\\'s nomination was defeated in the State Senate, House Republicans, with Youngkin\\'s support, announced plans to reject about 1,000 appointees to state boards; the appointees had all been nominated by Northam, and it was a long-standing custom in Virginia politics for an outgoing governor\\'s nominees to be confirmed with bipartisan support. Many of the nominees had already been serving in their positions for several months. After Democrats responded by threatening to reject all future appointments made by Youngkin, Republicans scaled back their plan and rejected only eleven of Northam\\'s nominees. The rejected nominees had been appointed to the Virginia State Board of Education, the State Air Pollution Control Board, the State Water Control Board, the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.  According to Republican leadership in the Virginia House of Delegates, vacancies were created on these specific boards so that Youngkin would have greater influence over boards related to his main policy priorities. Democrats retaliated in turn by rejecting four of Youngkin\\'s five nominees to the Virginia Parole Board and one of his nominees to the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board.According to The Washington Post, conflict continued to escalate throughout the 2022 legislative session between Youngkin and Democratic state legislators as a result of the dispute that had begun with Wheeler\\'s nomination. Youngkin went on to issue more vetoes during that session than any of his immediate predecessors had done during their own first years in office. All of the bills vetoed by Youngkin had been sponsored by Democrats and had passed the legislature with bipartisan support. In several cases, Youngkin vetoed bills sponsored by Democratic state senators while signing identical bills that had been sponsored by Republican delegates. It is common for identical bills to be passed in both chambers of the Virginia legislature, and it is considered standard for governors to sign both versions of such bills. In response to Youngkin\\'s vetoes, The Washington Post wrote, \"Typically a governor signs both versions, allowing both sponsors bragging rights for getting a bill passed into law. Longtime state legislators said they could not think of a case in which a governor signed one bill and vetoed its companion.\" The publication further wrote that \"the vetoes were widely seen as payback\" for the portion of Youngkin\\'s nominees that had been rejected by Democrats. Unpaid advisors. The Youngkin administration has drawn notice from both The Washington Post and The Richmond Times-Dispatch for its use of Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne as unpaid advisors.Moran served pro bono in the administration during the first half of 2022 as both Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs. He did so while on paid leave from two political consulting firms; one of these firms \"runs public affairs campaigns designed to influence legislators through such things as TV ads and polling\", according to The Washington Post. That publication, along with The Richmond Times-Dispatch, noted that Moran\\'s role in the Youngkin administration drew scrutiny for presenting a possible conflict of interest. The former publication wrote at the time that while there was precedent for Virginia governors to have unpaid advisors, \"Moran’s situation is especially unusual, because he works full time for the administration with a state title, but without upfront disclosure that he’s a volunteer on someone else’s payroll.\" In June 2022, the same publication wrote that Moran was \"transitioning to a new role as [Youngkin\\'s] full-time senior political adviser\".Aubrey Layne, who served as Secretary of Finance in the Northam administration, has served as an unpaid advisor to his successor in the Youngkin administration, Stephen E. Cummings, and has done so while serving as an executive at Sentara Healthcare.Richard Cullen, Youngkin\\'s counselor, has said that he personally determined both Layne and Moran\\'s roles in the administration to be in compliance with state ethics rules. Abortion. Youngkin describes himself as \"pro-life\" but says he supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother\\'s life. During his gubernatorial campaign, he criticized the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy except for when needed to protect the life of the mother. At that time, Youngkin stated his preference for a \"pain threshold bill\", which bans abortion at around twenty weeks. In July 2021, while running for governor, he was caught on a hot mic telling an activist that he would \"start going on offense\" against abortion rights if elected governor but would largely avoid the topic until then, saying \"as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won’t win my independent votes that I have to get.\"As governor, Youngkin introduced a failed amendment to the state budget, that if adopted by the legislature, would have banned the state government from funding abortion services in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. Youngkin claimed that this would have made Virginia\\'s policy on the public funding of abortion services consistent with the federal Hyde Amendment, which allows it only in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the mother\\'s life. In actuality, as noted by the Richmond Public Interest Law Review, Virginia policy on the matter still would have been broader than the Hyde Amendment, as the state law also allows public funding of abortion services when needed to protect the pregnant mother\\'s health.In May 2022, following the leaked draft opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization, Youngkin joined with Maryland Governor Larry Hogan in calling on the federal government to intervene against peaceful protests targeting the homes of conservative Supreme Court Justices living in Virginia and Maryland. Commenting on these abortion rights protests, Youngkin said, \"We have moments where common sense needs to prevail. And common sense here fully dictates that the ability to, in fact, demonstrate and express your views is protected under the First Amendment. It’s just not appropriate nor is it legal to do it at the residence of justices.\" Youngkin was criticized by some conservatives for seeking federal action rather than enforcing a state law that bars protesters from targeting private residences. The state law was dismissed as \"weak\" by Youngkin. The Washington Post described the state law\\'s constitutionality as unclear while noting that \"enforcement would be up to local authorities in Fairfax County, not the governor.\" The publication noted that Youngkin and Hogan both believed the protests to be in violation of \"a federal law that forbids demonstrations intended to sway judges on pending cases\". Youngkin sought to block the protesters by having a perimeter established around Justice Samuel Alito\\'s neighborhood, but his request was denied by Fairfax County officials, on the grounds that they believed such a perimeter would have been unconstitutional. In June 2022, Youngkin responded to the protests by introducing an amendment to the state budget, that if adopted, would have made it a felony in Virginia to participate in any protest seeking to intimidate or influence a judge. That budget amendment was defeated after receiving bipartisan opposition in the state legislature.After the final opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson was issued, Youngkin expressed his support for the ruling and announced that he would sign \"any bill\" restricting abortion access in Virginia. He then tasked four Republican state lawmakers with developing legislation on the topic. Advocating for a 15-week abortion ban, he acknowledged that there would be limitations on what could pass through the State Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, and suggested a 20-week ban as a possible compromise. Either ban as proposed by Youngkin would include exceptions for rape, incest, or protecting the mother\\'s life. Youngkin has indicated that he would support restricting abortion access in Virginia beyond a 15-week ban if he can garner enough votes to do so. COVID-19. Youngkin supports the COVID-19 vaccination effort but opposes mask and vaccine mandates. He and his family are vaccinated. In his first address to the General Assembly, he emphasized his position on the state\\'s vaccination efforts by stating, \"Speaking to you as your governor, I’ll never tell you what you must do. But speaking to you as your neighbor and a friend, I strongly encourage you to get the vaccine.\"Shortly before taking office, Youngkin announced that he would challenge the Biden administration\\'s employer vaccine mandate. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the mandate for certain health care workers but against the mandate for other private employers, Youngkin co-signed a letter with West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, asking the Biden administration to exempt rural and state run hospitals from the mandate, citing staffing shortages at many of those hospitals. In October 2022, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be added to each state\\'s list of required immunizations for school children, Youngkin stated that he would oppose any effort by the legislature to implement the recommendation.While running for governor, Youngkin said that he would model his public school mask policy after that of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by banning local school boards from implementing their own mask mandates. Youngkin reversed this position later in the campaign, saying through his PR team that although he opposed Virginia\\'s statewide public school mask mandate, he would give local school boards the discretion to implement their own mask policies. After winning the election, he re-emphasized his intention to repeal the statewide mandate while still allowing for local mandates. On his first day in office, January 15, 2022, he reversed his position again, signing an executive order that both repealed the statewide mandate and attempted to nullify any local mandates. This executive order was challenged by two lawsuits contending that it was in violation of state law at the time and exceeded Youngkin\\'s constitutional authority. It was also challenged by the ACLU in a lawsuit arguing that the order was discriminatory against medically vulnerable students. Youngkin called on Virginia parents to cooperate with school principals while the lawsuits proceeded. On February 16, 2022, Youngkin signed a bill that made masking optional in all public schools throughout Virginia. The bill passed along mostly party lines and took effect on March 1. The ACLU\\'s lawsuit against the Youngkin administration was decided on March 23, in a ruling that maintains Youngkin\\'s ban on school mask mandates except for in areas frequented by students that were represented in the lawsuit. The Youngkin administration appealed the ruling, and in December 2022, reached a settlement with the plaintiffs. As described by The Associated Press, that settlement \"largely tracks the terms\" of the court ruling from March. The settlement allows mask mandates to be implemented by Virginia public schools in areas frequented by the plaintiffs but also allows alternative seating or class assignments for any student impacted by such a mandate who does not want to wear a mask. Although the settlement applies only to students represented in the lawsuit, the ACLU has expressed the view that the settlement established a precedent allowing the same accommodations upon request for any medically vulnerable students attending Virginia public schools.Two other executive actions signed by Youngkin on his first day in office related to his pandemic response policies. One rescinded the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all state employees; the other called for a reevaluation of the workplace safety standards that the Northam administration had adopted as a pandemic mitigation strategy. On February 16, 2022, Youngkin convened the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry\\'s Safety and Health Codes Board to vote on whether to revoke those safety standards. A few days before the vote, House Republicans rejected the nominations of two members that had been appointed to the board by Northam; both members were expected to vote against revoking the safety standards. Their nominations were rejected as part of a larger process of expelling Northam appointees from several state boards, which was undertaken by Republicans in response to Democrats defeating Youngkin\\'s nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as a cabinet secretary.The remaining members of the Safety and Health Codes Board voted 7 to 3 in favor of recommending that the safety standards be revoked. Following a public comment period, the board reconvened on March 21 and voted to officially revoke the safety standards. Virginia had been the first state to adopt workplace safety standards in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the standards, which included a mask mandate for workers in high-risk indoor areas, officially ended on March 23, 2022.Upon taking office, Youngkin extended a limited state of emergency that had been implemented by the Northam administration ten days earlier to increase hospital capacity and allow medical professionals licensed in other states to practice in Virginia. The extension was originally set to last until February 21, 2022 but was renewed through March 22 of that year.In January 2022, the Virginia Department of Health, under Youngkin\\'s authority, became one of the first states to cease efforts at contact tracing every positive case of COVID-19. Health officials with the department explained that the decision was made primarily due to the increased difficulty of contact tracing the omicron variant. These officials further explained that the policy would allow the department to better focus its resources on responding to \"outbreaks and cases in high risk settings\" and that individuals who test positive should continue to personally notify contacts.In May 2022, Youngkin announced that on July 5 of that year, he would be scaling back the telework policy for Virginia\\'s executive branch employees, which had been expanded two years earlier by Northam in response to the pandemic. Under Youngkin\\'s policy, those employees can telework one day a week or on a temporary basis with approval from the head of their agency, two days a week with approval from a cabinet secretary, and three or more days a week with approval from Youngkin\\'s chief of staff. As noted by The Richmond-Times Dispatch, \"employees of state colleges and universities, legislative or judicial agencies, or independent commissions and authorities\" are all exempt from the policy.Youngkin argued that his telework policy would lead to increased innovation and improved customer service across state agencies. Democrats criticized the policy, arguing that it would endanger state workers amid the ongoing pandemic while causing retention problems for state agencies. They called on Youngkin to maintain Northam\\'s policy until at least after Labor Day, so as to ease pressure on state employees struggling to find childcare over the summer. Youngkin\\'s policy not only rescinds Northam\\'s policy but gives state agencies less discretion to approve telework arrangements than they had held before the pandemic began. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Youngkin\\'s policy diverged from private sector trends favoring telework options and could lead to challenges for state employees in rural areas with particularly long commutes. In early June, the Youngkin administration missed a self-imposed deadline for approving telework requests. In between Youngkin\\'s announcement of the policy and the July 5 start date of the policy, hundreds of state employees resigned. Criminal justice. FOIA law. In 2022, Youngkin signed a bill reversing the effects of a 2021 amendment to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Under the 2021 amendment, which had been signed by Youngkin\\'s predecessor, Ralph Northam, law enforcement was required to fulfill all requests for files pertaining to closed investigations, although they were allowed to redact any information that could violate privacy and were not allowed to release audio or visual materials depicting victims to anyone other than those victims or their families. According to The Washington Post, before this amendment was enacted, law enforcement in Virginia \"typically used their discretion to deny access to virtually all of their files, from all requesters\".The bill signed by Youngkin in 2022 restored discretion to law enforcement over whether to release files pertaining to closed investigations but still requires that access to such files be granted to the families of victims and to attorneys working on post-conviction proceedings. Under the bill, if law enforcement chooses to fulfill any other request, they can do so only after victims involved in the investigation have been notified and given a chance to object; any victim who objects can then file for an injunction, at which point a judge would determine the outcome of the request. Youngkin\\'s reform of Virginia\\'s FOIA law gained some bipartisan support in the Virginia legislature but was opposed by the Innocence Project. Policing. On March 1, 2022, Youngkin vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have shifted authority for hiring a local auditor of police misconduct in Arlington County from the County Manager to the County Board. The auditor would be tasked with working alongside a civilian oversight board that Arlington County had established one year earlier in response to the racial justice protests of 2020. As a Dillon Rule state, Virginia localities require approval from the state government to make decisions over any matter that state law has not explicitly given them control over, and the Arlington County Board had wanted authority for hiring the auditor, so as to ensure the position\\'s independence from local law enforcement, which is overseen by the County Manager, who also hires the county\\'s police chief.The Washington Post described the vetoed legislation as \"esoteric but noteworthy\". The publication wrote that Youngkin\\'s veto \"appeared to tie the bill...to much broader debates over how local governments should scrutinize police\" and was largely inspired by Youngkin\\'s displeasure with the civilian oversight board, which had already been approved. While explaining his veto, Youngkin criticized the auditor\\'s position as one with disciplinary powers over police officers – according to the author of the vetoed legislation, Youngkin mischaracterized the position, as the auditor does not have disciplinary powers. This was the first veto of Youngkin\\'s governorship.Later in 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters. Wherever implemented, the Marcus alert system requires that mental health professionals be involved in responding to any mental health crises reported to 911. Certain localities in Virginia began adopting the system in late 2021. When signed into law by Northam, the system was required to be implemented statewide by July 2026. The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempts Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system. This exemption applies to about 67% of Virginia localities and over 19% of the state\\'s population. It was adopted due to concerns about the cost of implementing the system statewide.When first established by Northam, the Marcus alert system was criticized by Peters\\' sister, Princess Blanding, for its slow adoption process and for continuing to give law enforcement a significant role in responding to many mental health crisis situations. Her belief that the Marcus alert system needed to be improved upon led her to run as an independent candidate against Youngkin and McAuliffe in Virginia\\'s 2021 gubernatorial election. Although Youngkin\\'s legislation downscaling the system gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by Blanding and most House Democrats.Another bill signed by Youngkin in 2022 bans law enforcement agencies in Virginia from using quotas for ticket-writing or arrests. This bill, which was proposed by the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, also states that \"the number of arrests made or summonses issued by a law-enforcement officer shall not be used as the sole criterion for evaluating the law-enforcement officer\\'s job performance.\" Both parties in the state legislature supported the bill. Although as originally written, the bill provided for violations of its bans to be investigated by the FBI, this provision was removed from the final bill. Sentence credits. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget limited the number of inmates who could qualify for an expanded early release program that was scheduled to begin later that summer. The program allows inmates in Virginia to earn time off their sentences through good behavior credits. It had been expanded through legislation signed in 2020 by Youngkin\\'s predecessor, Ralph Northam, so that Virginia\\'s cap on how many good behavior credits could be earned was raised for most inmates. As this expansion of the program was originally designed, the newly available credits could not be used to reduce sentences for violent crimes but could be used by inmates convicted of violent crimes to reduce any concurrent or consecutive sentences that had been imposed for nonviolent crimes. Youngkin and other Republicans characterized this aspect of the program as an unintentional loophole that needed correcting. Democrats largely disagreed with that characterization, arguing that the expanded program had been intentionally designed to give violent offenders the ability to reduce sentences unrelated to violent offenses. Youngkin\\'s amendment was adopted by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. It made inmates convicted of violent crimes fully ineligible for the expanded program, meaning that these inmates could not use the newly available credits to reduce any sentences.Although the expanded early release program was approved by Northam in 2020, it did not take effect until July 1, 2022. Because the newly available credits were made applicable retroactively for anyone who would have earned them earlier in their sentences, about 550 inmates convicted of violent crimes were set to be released once the law took effect in July 2022. Youngkin\\'s amendment was approved a few weeks before these inmates would have been released. As a result, these inmates were not released at that time, even though they had already been told of their planned release. Economy. During his campaign for governor, Youngkin frequently said that Virginia\\'s economy was \"in the ditch\". Some political scientists, such as Mark Rozell, considered this an unusual position, since throughout the campaign, Virginia had low unemployment, a budget surplus, and a AAA bond rating. The state had also been rated that year by CNBC as the Top State for Business. Youngkin argued against the merits of the CNBC rating, stating that it put too much emphasis on inclusivity and noting Virginia\\'s poor ratings in the \"cost of living\" and \"cost of doing business\" categories. During Youngkin\\'s first year in office, Virginia lost its top spot on the CNBC list, after having earned that spot twice in a row during Northam\\'s governorship. The lower ranking under Youngkin was due to Virginia earning worse scores in the \"life, health and inclusion\" and \"workforce\" categories. Taxes. The Washington Post noted that more than two months after winning the Republican nomination, Youngkin had \"yet to disclose any formal economic plan.\" One of Youngkin\\'s main proposals at that stage of the race was an elimination of Virginia\\'s individual income tax. According to NPR, this proposal received \"criticism from both Democrats and Republicans that doing so would wipe out around 70% of Virginia\\'s General Fund.\" Before the end of his campaign, Youngkin retracted his proposal to eliminate the tax, calling it \"aspirational\" and saying, \"In Virginia, we can\\'t get rid of income tax, but we sure can try to bring it down.\"In late August 2021, Youngkin announced a series of more modest tax cut proposals. These included eliminating the grocery tax, suspending the gas tax increase, offering a one-time rebate on income tax, doubling the standard deduction on income tax, cutting the retirement tax on veterans\\' income, implementing voter approval for any increase to local real estate property taxes, and offering a tax holiday for small businesses. Upon their announcement, the Associated Press called these proposals \"the most wide-ranging and detailed look at the priorities of a potential Youngkin administration\". Had these proposals gone on to be enacted in full, they would have amounted to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts. During the campaign, Youngkin proposed paying for much of his proposed tax cuts with the state\\'s budget surplus, which at the time, was projected to total $2.6 billion. Although The Washington Post and NPR both noted that much of that revenue would be unavailable for tax cuts, since state law required that over half of the amount be devoted to the state\\'s \"rainy day\" reserve fund, water quality improvement fund, and transportation fund, Virginia\\'s budget surplus continued to grow, and by the end of Northam\\'s term, was projected to total at least $13.4 billion for the state\\'s then-upcoming budget cycle.As his campaign\\'s senior economic advisor, Youngkin hired Stephen Moore, who had helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas several years earlier when Sam Brownback was in office as that state\\'s governor. NPR noted towards the end of the Virginia gubernatorial campaign that Youngkin \"sourced much of his fiscal agenda from [Moore].\" In response to Moore\\'s hiring, The Washington Post described the Brownback tax cuts as \"an experiment widely seen as a failure, leading the state to slash spending for priorities such as education and transportation when revenue dried up\". The publication noted that the tax cuts were ultimately repealed \"on a bipartisan vote\". Youngkin\\'s Democratic gubernatorial opponent, Terry McAuliffe, cited the economic downturn in Kansas as a way to critique Youngkin\\'s economic platform. Moore acknowledged after joining the Youngkin campaign that the Brownback tax cuts had negatively impacted the Kansas economy but argued that they should be perceived as an anomaly, saying that several other states \"did really well when they lowered taxes\".In 2022, Youngkin signed a two-year, $165 billion state budget featuring $4 billion in tax cuts. According to The Washington Post, the \"centerpiece\" of this budget was \"a big increase in the standard deduction for personal income tax.\" Rather than doubling the standard deduction, as Youngkin had proposed, the budget increased it by about 80%, raising it from $4,500 to $8,000 for individuals and from $9,000 to $16,000 for couples filing jointly. The budget included one-time tax rebates and a partial elimination of Virginia\\'s grocery tax, both of which aligned with Northam\\'s own outgoing budget proposals rather than with Youngkin\\'s preferred tax policies. As Northam had proposed, the one-time tax rebates amounted to $250 for individuals and $500 for couples, slightly less than Youngkin\\'s desired $300 for individuals and $600 for couples, and although the final budget enacted Northam and Youngkin\\'s shared goal of eliminating a 1.5% grocery tax that had been levied by the state, Democrats blocked Youngkin\\'s additional proposal to eliminate a separate 1% grocery tax levied by Virginia localities. Fully included in the budget was Youngkin\\'s proposal to enact a tax exemption of up to $40,000 a year for military pensions. According to The Washington Post, the exemption will be \"phased in over several years.\" Another proposal of Northam\\'s included in the budget was making up to 15% of the earned income tax credit refundable. This policy, designed to benefit low-income tax filers, was described by The Richmond-Times Dispatch as \"a longtime Democratic priority\" and had been opposed by Republicans. It was included in the budget as a compromise between the two parties.Youngkin\\'s goal of offering relief from the state\\'s gas tax was blocked by the legislature along mostly party lines. Democrats argued that the plan proposed by Youngkin would have deprived the state of revenue for transportation projects while offering insufficient relief to consumers. According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, it was estimated that about one-third of the savings from Youngkin\\'s gas tax holiday proposal would have been kept by the oil industry, while about one-quarter of the savings would have gone to out-of-state drivers. Youngkin acknowledged that his proposal may not have resulted in significant savings for Virginians, saying, \"We can’t guarantee anything\". He opposed a Democratic counter proposal to send direct payments to Virginia car owners. Both WTOP and WRIC estimated that Youngkin\\'s proposal for suspending the gas tax would have decreased funding for Virginia transportation projects by about $400 million.During the 2022 legislative session, Youngkin failed to enact a proposal of his that would have required Virginia localities with rising real estate values to either gain approval through public referendums for any increases in revenue resulting from local real estate taxes or else lower their local real estate tax rates. This proposal was described by the Youngkin administration as \"a pillar\" of its tax plan.Although the budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 passed with bipartisan support, it was opposed by several Democrats who argued that too much of the state\\'s record surplus was spent on tax cuts at the expense of funding for affordable housing, mental health services, gun violence prevention, and transportation. Affordable housing and tenant protections. The state budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included a $150 million investment in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, which is devoted to providing affordable housing in the state. This amounted to half the total Northam had proposed investing in the fund. According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, the state would need to invest $5 billion annually to fully address its affordable housing needs. Youngkin has said that he opposes any further investments in affordable housing.In 2022, Youngkin vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have given judges the ability to mandate that landlords address code violations. Under current Virginia law, negligent landlords can be fined or have their properties condemned, but localities have no way to mandate that safety hazards be addressed by landlords. In explaining his veto, Youngkin called the legislation \"unnecessary\" and said that tenants should share responsibility with landlords for maintaining safe living conditions. Labor rights and public services. Youngkin has said that he intends to continue efforts begun under his predecessor, Ralph Northam, to modernize the Virginia Employment Commission, which, according to The Washington Post, \"struggled with outdated computer systems and a lack of staffing during the heightened demands of the pandemic.\" On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a review of the state agency. In March 2022, his administration was awarded a grant from the Biden administration\\'s Labor Department to combat inequities in the Virginia Employment Commission\\'s operations. The grant was made available through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Virginia was among the first states to receive such a grant, because, according to The Washington Post, its application to participate in the program had been one of the \"most thorough\". Youngkin\\'s administration has not announced its plans for the grant money.Youngkin has also said that he intends to continue efforts begun under Northam to expand broadband access in Virginia.Youngkin opposes the gradual minimum wage increase that was initiated in Virginia by the Northam administration, arguing that the eventual target of $15 dollars an hour will cause the state to \"lose jobs\". He supports Virginia\\'s right-to-work law and has promised to veto any legislation repealing it. He has also backed the idea of repealing both collective bargaining rights for public employees and the requirement that all public works use project labor agreements. Education. Youngkin\\'s education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies. According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education\". The New York Times wrote that Youngkin\\'s campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone\". Cultural issues and curriculum. Throughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state. Politifact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms. The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there\\'s a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students.\" Critics of Youngkin noted that he sent his own children to private schools where resources promoting critical race theory have been recommended. Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as \"ground zero for Youngkin\\'s victory\", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state\\'s Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system\\'s handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator\\'s lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin\\'s Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin\\'s predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls\\' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin\\'s first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order \"targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students.\"This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as \"a dumbing down of standards\". Youngkin called the program a \"left-wing takeover of public education\", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes – a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign. James Lane, Virginia Superintendent at the time, and NPR, both disputed this characterization of the program. The Virginia Math Pathways Initiative would have prioritized data science and data analytics over calculus while still offering students the opportunity to enroll in calculus at an accelerated pace. Although education officials within the Northam administration explored the potential benefits of detracking students prior to the 11th grade, no plans to do so were ever adopted, and in April 2021, those officials explained that the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative was not designed to eliminate advanced math classes at any grade level. Shortly after Youngkin and other conservatives first began speaking out against the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative, The Washington Post reported that the actual nature of the program had been \"obscured...[by] prominent Virginians and copious coverage from right-wing news outlets\" as \"outrage built online\" among those opposed to it.In early April 2022, Youngkin signed a bill allowing school parents throughout Virginia to review and opt their children out of any educational material containing \"sexually explicit content\"; any opted out student would be provided with alternative material. This is the first statewide law in the nation allowing for parental review of sexually explicit content in school curriculum. Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\". The bill passed along mostly party lines. A similar bill, known as the \"Beloved Bill\", was vetoed by McAuliffe in both 2016 and 2017. That bill, which had originated when a conservative activist took issue with the inclusion of Beloved in her high school senior son\\'s AP English class, became one of the focal points of Virginia\\'s 2021 gubernatorial election, and reviving the bill was identified by The Washington Post as \"one of the key promises\" of Youngkin\\'s campaign. The provisions of the bill will take effect in 2023.In May 2022, Youngkin sent a letter to the Council of Presidents overseeing Virginia colleges and universities, urging mandatory political diversity in their hiring practices. That year, he introduced a budget amendment, which succeeded in the General Assembly, requiring that the state\\'s public colleges and universities promote \"free speech and diversity of thought on [their] campuses.\"In August 2022, Youngkin enlisted the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, to assist in revising Virginia\\'s educational standards for history and social sciences.During the 2022 legislative session, Youngkin advocated for a bill that would have reversed reforms that had been recently adopted to the admissions processes at some Governor\\'s Schools in Virginia, specifically at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria and at Maggie L. Walker Governor\\'s School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. Although race blind, the reformed admissions processes achieved their goal by implementing an approach largely based on geographic and socioeconomic factors. The bill supported by Youngkin would have banned such an approach, characterizing the use of geographic and socioeconomic factors as \"proxy discrimination\". This bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but failed in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. A separate bill signed by Youngkin that same year bans Governor\\'s Schools in Virginia \"from discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the process of admitting students to such school.\" This bill, which received bipartisan support, was described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as \"a watered-down version\" of Youngkin\\'s preferred bill. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin \"has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law.\" Tipline for \"divisive practices\". During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin\\'s executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\" Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\".The tipline was described by The Washington Post as \"part of a broader push by Youngkin to identify and root out what he says are elements of critical race theory in the state’s curriculum.\" The publication further reported that the tipline was viewed by \"a teachers union, Democrats in the General Assembly, some parents and other observers...as divisive, authoritarian and unfairly targeting educators.\" Virginia Republicans have defended the tipline by comparing it to systems that previous governors of the state had set up for people to report violations of business regulations and health protocols. On January 26, a spokesperson for Youngkin tweeted that critics of the tipline had mischaracterized it and described the tipline as \"a customary constituent service.\"A week after the tipline debuted, CNN reported that the initiative had drawn national attention. Colin Jost derided the tipline on Saturday Night Live during Weekend Update, and John Legend encouraged opponents of the initiative to co-opt the tipline, tweeting, \"Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced. We are parents too.\" Several media outlets reported that critics of Youngkin were spamming the tipline. Describing it as a \"snitch line\", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would \"backfire\" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by \"Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic\", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.On February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was \"responding\" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia\\'s FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin\\'s office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had \"quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up\". The second lawsuit is still ongoing. Loudoun County School Board proposal. During Virginia\\'s 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board\\'s nine members. A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at \"holding [the board] to account\" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county\\'s school system a year earlier. Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin\\'s gubernatorial campaign. In response to Youngkin\\'s proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office. The Washington Post reported that Youngkin\\'s effort had \"stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.\" The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the \"more controversial actions\" that Youngkin had taken and led to \"one of the harshest partisan eruptions\" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin\\'s term. Legal scholar A.E. Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia\\'s Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s. The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Repeal of protections for transgender students. In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools. These protections had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. That bill requires that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with \"model policies\" developed by the Virginia Department of Education. Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes. The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student. Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student\\'s name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student\\'s preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin\\'s policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students. It has been suggested that Youngkin\\'s policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot \"encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student’s parent, including information related to gender.\"The Youngkin administration framed its replacement of the Northam administration\\'s policies as part of a \"commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students.\" The Washington Post noted that Youngkin\\'s actions fit into a national trend among Republicans, writing that \"at least 300 pieces of legislation\" curtailing the rights of transgender Americans had been introduced throughout the country in 2022, mostly focusing on children. Despite the legal requirement that they do so, most Virginia school districts had failed to adopt the Northam administration\\'s model policies by the time that the Youngkin administration\\'s replacement policies were announced. Other school districts have refused to adopt the Youngkin administration\\'s model policies, expressing the view that these policies are in violation of state law.Youngkin\\'s actions are expected to face court challenges. Although the 2020 bill signed by Northam did not specify what Virginia\\'s model policies for the treatment of transgender students should be, it stated that the policies should \"address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices\" and that the policies should protect transgender students from bullying and harassment. Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin\\'s model policies fail to meet this criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law. It has been reported that Youngkin\\'s model policies may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act, which bans schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, and that Youngkin\\'s policy mandating that students use restrooms corresponding with their biological sex may be unenforceable due to the 2020 court ruling in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, which mandates that students in Virginia be allowed to use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity.Shortly after the Youngkin administration\\'s policies were announced, several thousand students from over ninety Virginia schools protested the policies by engaging in walkouts. Organizers of the walkouts stated that the Youngkin administration\\'s policies \"will only hurt students in a time when students are facing unparalleled mental health challenges, and are a cruel attempt to politicize the existence of LGBTQIA+ students for political gain.\" Education budget. Youngkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average. Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia\\'s biennual education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, while McAuliffe\\'s platform called for increasing the state\\'s spending on education by $2 billion annually. The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state\\'s achievement gaps.In contrast to McAuliffe, who introduced much of his education platform concurrently with his announcement to run in the Democratic primary, Youngkin did not begin sharing proposals for state spending on education until months after securing the Republican nomination. McAuliffe criticized Youngkin for not releasing budget details until late in the campaign and argued that spending on education in Virginia could be threatened by the extent of Youngkin\\'s tax cut proposals. The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin\\'s education platform was \"far lighter on details\" than McAuliffe\\'s and that it largely focused on cultural issues over budgetary proposals. Youngkin began offering specific proposals for education spending late in the summer of 2021, only a few months before the election. These proposals included $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.Youngkin inherited a record surplus in state revenue from Northam, which was projected to continue growing during the state\\'s then-upcoming budget cycle. As a result of this surplus, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a biennial state budget in 2022 that committed $19.2 billion to education, a record for the state even when accounting for inflation. This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats. In exchange for getting much of their desired education spending enacted, Democrats agreed to enact several of Youngkin\\'s tax cut proposals.Incorporated into the budget compromise was an outgoing proposal of Northam\\'s to enact a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers. This plan was chosen over the one preferred by Republicans, which would have paired a more modest 8% salary increase for teachers over two years with 1% bonuses.School construction and maintenance received $1.25 billion in the 2022 biennial state budget. This exceeds the amount that had been allotted for these needs in Northam\\'s outgoing budget proposals but is a small fraction of the $25 billion that the Virginia Department of Education says it would take to fully replace the state\\'s oldest schools.The Virginia Preschool Initiative was expanded by the 2022 biennial state budget. This program provides preschool for many low-income children in the state. Prior to 2022, the program only served children aged four or older, and only families earning less than the federal poverty line could qualify. The 2022 state budget that Youngkin signed lowered the age eligibility to include three year olds and raised the income threshold to 300% of the federal poverty line. Teacher shortages. In September 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order directing education officials in his administration to combat Virginia\\'s teacher shortages by easing the process of gaining a teaching license in the state. The order aims to fill vacancies by focusing in large part on recruiting retired teachers, people whose teaching licenses have expired, people with out-of-state teaching licenses, college students in teacher training programs, and military veterans seeking to transition into teaching careers. The order also provides additional funding to school districts with the most severe teacher shortages in Virginia and seeks to bolster in-school child care options for teachers.The Washington Post reported that \"Youngkin’s actions to loosen standards regarding who can become a teacher mirror efforts in other states, including Florida and Arizona, as the nation faces a catastrophic teacher shortage.\" According to the same publication, some educator groups in Virginia have criticized aspects of Youngkin\\'s executive order, arguing that it could \"allow unqualified individuals to teach children\", while education policy experts have argued that teacher shortages have been exacerbated in Virginia by education-related culture war issues that Youngkin has escalated during his governorship. Charter schools and lab schools. While running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term. After the election, The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that Youngkin\\'s actual goal for charter schools would be to increase the number in Virginia \"to match North Carolina, which has more than 200.\" Only seven charter schools currently exist in Virginia, one of the lowest amounts in the country, and Youngkin has backed proposed legislation that would shift the authority to approve new charter schools from local school boards to newly created \"regional charter school divisions\". These divisions would have nine voting members, eight appointed by the Virginia State Board of Education, and one appointed by local school boards within the region.The state budget that Youngkin signed for 2022 includes $100 million for re-establishing lab schools in Virginia. These K-12 public schools, which are separate from charter schools, had previously existed in the state and had continued to be allowed under Virginia law before Youngkin came into office, but none remained operating in the state by the start of Youngkin\\'s term. Previous lab schools in Virginia had been established as partnerships with institutions of higher learning; only public colleges and universities with teacher training programs were allowed to enter into these partnerships. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget removed the requirement that all lab schools in the state act as teacher training programs. It also opened lab school partnerships to be formed with community colleges or certain private universities. Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears had to break a tie vote in the State Senate for this budget amendment to be approved by the General Assembly. Youngkin has additionally advocated for allowing private businesses to enter into lab school partnerships. He has said that lab schools could be either newly established or converted out of existing schools and has supported legislation that would direct the Virginia State Board of Education to \"give substantial preference\" to lab school applications filed by historically black colleges or universities. Under that legislation, the same preference would be given to applications seeking to establish lab schools in \"underserved communities\".Youngkin supports revising how Virginia public schools are funded, so that per pupil funding for any students attending lab schools in the state would go to the institutions operating the schools attended by those students instead of going to the public school boards for the districts where those students reside. An amendment proposed by Youngkin for the 2022 state budget would have enacted this plan but was not adopted by the General Assembly. Although the Virginia Education Association and the Editorial Board of The Free Lance–Star have both supported Youngkin\\'s goal of re-establishing lab schools in Virginia, they have also both criticized Youngkin\\'s plan for redirecting per pupil funding away from local school boards, noting that because Virginia law allows lab schools to enroll students from anywhere in the state, the plan could lead to decreased funding for certain school districts. College athletics. In 2022, Youngkin signed legislation allowing college athletes in Virginia to profit through name, image, and likeness deals. This permanently codified a policy that had already been enacted on a temporary basis a year earlier when Northam was in office. The policy had been temporary under Northam because it had been enacted through the state budget. As had been the case when enacted by Northam, the policy as enacted by Youngkin does not allow college athletes to sponsor or endorse alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, drugs, weapons, casinos, or adult entertainment. The policy allows student athletes to hire agents and ensures that scholarships cannot be lost as a result of earning compensation through a name, image, and likeness deal. School safety. In April 2022, Youngkin signed House Bill 741 into law mandating all public schools in Virginia to create detailed digital floor plans of their buildings. The law also provides $6.5 million to schools to create these floor plans.In May 2022, Youngkin signed a bipartisan bill requiring that principals report to law enforcement certain misdemeanor crimes committed by students on school grounds. This restores a law that had existed before the Northam administration. In 2020, Northam had signed a bill giving principals discretion over whether to report misdemeanor crimes to law enforcement. Northam\\'s policy, which had still required the reporting of felonies, had been adopted in an effort to combat the school-to-prison pipeline. Data from before Northam\\'s policy had been adopted showed that more students in Virginia were reported to law enforcement than in any other state.In June 2022, shortly after the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Youngkin stressed his support for placing school resource officers in every school in Virginia.Another bill signed by Youngkin in 2022 requires that all members of student organizations at colleges or universities in Virginia receive training to prevent hazing. The bill, which was adopted with near unanimous support in the state legislature, also requires chapter advisors to undergo such training, requires that all hazing violations be publicly disclosed, and provides immunity to bystanders who report hazing violations. Environment. Asked if he accepts the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change, Youngkin said he does not know what causes climate change and that he considers the cause to be irrelevant. He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls. While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia\\'s Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia\\'s carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices. Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas. He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade.After winning the election, Youngkin said that he would use an executive action to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market. Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year; this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia\\'s membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California\\'s vehicle emissions standards.In his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia\\'s flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.In April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam\\'s order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"Additional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state\\'s permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia\\'s two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin\\'s legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.Only a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin\\'s legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental groups. Health care. During Virginia\\'s 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use. Both bills had passed the state legislature with broad bipartisan support. Youngkin explained his veto of the latter bill by claiming that such a policy would have caused higher costs for consumers. According to The Washington Post, this claim conflicted with national studies showing that the policy would have decreased costs for consumers. The publication also noted that Youngkin\\'s veto of that bill was in opposition to \"the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan study commission\". Immigration. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget took $10 million over two years that had been planned as financial aid for undocumented immigrants pursuing higher education in Virginia and used the money instead to increase financial aid for students attending Virginia\\'s historically black colleges and universities. The amendment was passed by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. According to The Washington Post, half of the money reallocated by the amendment will be \"used to supplement in-state student aid at Norfolk State and Virginia State universities, which are both public institutions\" and the other half will be used to \"increase Virginia Tuition Assistance Grants, a form of aid for residents attending private colleges and universities, to $7,500 from $5,000 a year for students enrolled in historically Black institutions.\" Lamont Bagby, chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, condemned the amendment, calling it the wrong way to help HBCUs. Several Democrats characterized the amendment as an effort to \"pit\" two different disadvantaged student groups against each other. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Youngkin could have drawn from \"up to $50 million in unappropriated money\" in state revenue to assist Virginia\\'s HBCUs, rather than taking money that had been initially allocated to assist undocumented immigrant students. LGBTQ rights. Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage, but has said he would not interfere with the issue as governor. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said that he considers same-sex marriage \"legally acceptable\" and that \"as governor, [he] would support [legal same-sex marriage].\" He has maintained the governor\\'s LGBTQ+ Advisory Board but has been criticized by members of that board for what they have described as his lack of meaningful support for the LGBTQ+ community.In June 2022, Youngkin expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month; he hosted \"a private Pride reception at the Capitol\" but did not invite any of Virginia\\'s openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. Those who boycotted the event did so because they saw it as inconsistent with Youngkin\\'s policy stances, which they considered to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. That same month, Youngkin hosted the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ+ Republican group, at the Governor\\'s Mansion. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which wrote that Youngkin\\'s choice to celebrate Pride Month \"dismays many people of faith\".In July 2022, shortly after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if that court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can\\'t live in the world of hypotheticals.\" The Virginia Constitution includes an amendment banning same-sex marriage, which, according to Washington Post, \"would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself.\" An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin\\'s first year in office. Marijuana. A few months after his inauguration, Youngkin proposed that Virginia recriminalize possessing more than two ounces of marijuana. When the Northam administration, a year earlier, had legalized possessing up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia, it did so while establishing a system in which possessing between one ounce and one pound was made punishable by a $25 fine; possessing over one pound remained a felony. This system made Virginia the only US state to have legalized marijuana possession without having misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount. Youngkin\\'s proposal to introduce such penalties in Virginia was inspired by a recommendation made in 2021 by the state legislature\\'s nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.Under Youngkin\\'s proposal, possessing more than two ounces of marijuana would become a Class 2 misdemeanor, while possessing more than six ounces would become a Class 1 misdemeanor. Before this proposal was made, the Democratic-controlled State Senate had passed a bill during the 2022 legislative session that would have made possessing more than four ounces of marijuana a Class 3 misdemeanor. That bill, which also would have legalized the sale of recreational marijuana in Virginia, was rejected by the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. Later that year, as part of a bipartisan budget deal signed by Youngkin, Virginia made possessing between four ounces and a pound of marijuana in public a Class 3 misdemeanor for a first time offense and a Class 2 misdemeanor for repeat offenses. This same budget deal banned the sale of cannabis products shaped as animals, humans, vehicles, or fruits, so as to protect against accidental consumption by children.Separate marijuana legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 allows patients to purchase medical marijuana immediately upon receiving a certificate to do so from a registered medical provider. Previously, patients were required to register with the State Board of Pharmacy before they could make such a purchase. This reform was enacted due to long wait times occurring during the registration process.Youngkin has also proposed raising the legal age for purchasing CBD products in Virginia to 21 and banning products that contain Delta-8 THC, which is described by The Washington Post as \"a hemp-derived compound that has become popular for its similarity to Delta-9, the main compound in marijuana that gives consumers a high. Voting rights. As governor, Youngkin has continued the work of restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell\\'s immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam. Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences. An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam\\'s final year in office, but amendments  to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum, and Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin\\'s first year in office.In 2022, Youngkin signed bipartisan legislation requiring that the removal of deceased voters from Virginia\\'s electoral rolls be conducted on a weekly basis; this had previously been done on a monthly basis. That same year, Youngkin signed legislation changing how absentee ballots are reported in Virginia. Previously, these ballots had been reported as part of a single, at-large precinct. Youngkin\\'s legislation requires that they instead be reported precinct-by-precinct. Involvement in the 2022 federal midterms. During the 2022 federal elections, Youngkin campaigned frequently for Republicans in other states, supporting both candidates who had embraced Donald Trump\\'s false claims about the 2020 election and those who had not. This led to The Washington Post writing that Youngkin had \"demonstrated uncommon flexibility on an issue that for others...represents a bright line.\" Youngkin\\'s refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his own party has elicited criticism from some moderate Republicans, such as Liz Cheney, David Jolly, and Bill Kristol.Among the candidates Youngkin campaigned for during the midterms was former Maine governor Paul LePage, who was seeking a nonconsecutive third term in office. During his previous tenure as governor, LePage had drawn controversy for a series of comments that both Republican and Democratic politicians condemned as racist; these comments included LePage stating that \"the enemy right now...are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.\" Youngkin initially claimed to be unaware of these comments. He later condemned the comments but defended his choice to campaign for LePage, claiming that LePage had apologized. As reported by The Washington Post, LePage had not actually apologized for most of the comments.Hours after it was reported that Nancy Pelosi\\'s husband, Paul Pelosi, was the victim of a politically motivated assault that left him with a fractured skull, Youngkin appeared at a campaign appearance in support of a Republican congressional candidate running in the 2022 federal midterms, where he stated, \"Speaker Pelosi’s husband – they had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re gonna go do.\" Virginia Democrats condemned Youngkin for choosing to speak against the Pelosis so soon after the attack. When asked if he wanted to apologize for the comment, Youngkin chose not to do so but stated, \"a terrible thing happened to the speaker’s husband and it should never have happened and we wish him a speedy recovery. The first lady and I keep him in our prayers.\" Time magazine wrote that Youngkin and other Republicans who used the assault to engage in criticism of the Pelosis had \"highlighted the devolved state of American political discourse\", while Don Scott, the Democratic leader in Virginia\\'s House of Delegates, stated that Youngkin\\'s response to the assault was part of a long trend in which he felt that \"Youngkin\\'s espoused Christian values didn\\'t match his actions\". A few days after his initial comment, Youngkin stated that he \"didn\\'t do a great job\" of condemning the attack and apologized for his rhetoric in a handwritten letter to Nancy Pelosi.

The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin\\\\\\'s executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\"[215] Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\".\\\\n\\\\nThe tipline was described by The Washington Post as \"part of a broader push by Youngkin to identify and root out what he says are elements of critical race theory in the state’s curriculum.\" The publication further reported that the tipline was viewed by \"a teachers union, Democrats in the General Assembly, some parents and other observers...as divisive, authoritarian and unfairly targeting educators.\" Virginia Republicans have defended the tipline by comparing it to systems that previous governors of the state had set up for people to report violations of business regulations and health protocols. On January 26, a spokesperson for Youngkin tweeted that critics of the tipline had mischaracterized it and described the tipline as \"a customary constituent service.\" A week after the tipline debuted, CNN reported that the initiative had drawn national attention. Colin Jost derided the tipline on Saturday Night Live during Weekend Update, and John Legend encouraged opponents of the initiative to co-opt the tipline, tweeting, \"Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced. We are parents too.\" Several media outlets reported that critics of Youngkin were spamming the tipline. Describing it as a \"snitch line\", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would \"backfire\" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by \"Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic\", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.\\\\n\\\\nOn February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was \"responding\" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia\\\\\\'s FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin\\\\\\'s office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had \"quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up\". The second lawsuit is still ongoing.\\', \\'1.

Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas.[275] He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade.\\\\n\\\\nAfter winning the election, Youngkin said that he would use an executive action to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market. Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year? this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia\\\\\\'s membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California\\\\\\'s vehicle emissions standards.\\\\n\\\\nIn his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels.

The Brothers were formed in 1967, and established an association with the Hells Angels in California\\'s San Francisco Bay Area by 1977. The club \"patched over\" to the HAMC during a ceremony in California attended by members of the Brothers\\' Fairbanks chapter. The Alaskan Hells Angels are involved in methamphetamine trafficking. Operation CACUS. Anchorage Hells Angels chapter sergeant-at-arms Anthony John Tait volunteered to become a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1985, and he provided the government with detailed information on the club\\'s organization and criminal activities – such as drugs and explosives trafficking – for two years. During this period, Tait travelled the country at government expense to meet with various Hells Angels members, and he covertly recorded some of these meetings by wearing a wire. As part of the investigation, the informant and undercover agents purchased approximately $1.6 million of cocaine and methamphetamine from the Hells Angels, in addition to more than twenty pounds of explosives, three automatic weapons and two silencers. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation CACUS culminated with 38 HAMC members in Alaska and four other states being arrested on narcotics, weapons, explosives and conspiracy charges on November 10, 1987. Anchorage chapter president Edward Floyd Hubert and Fairbanks chapter president Dennis E. Pailing were among fourteen people taken into custody during raids by FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents on homes in Anchorage and a compound in Fairbanks.Ten Hells Angels from California and Alaska, including Hubert and Pailing, were extradited to Louisville, Kentucky to face charges of conspiring to transport firearms and explosives across state lines in order to kill members of the Outlaws in retaliation for the death of John Cleave Webb, the previous Anchorage Hells Angels president who was fatally shot by two Outlaws outside a saloon in Jefferson County, Kentucky on August 12, 1986. On October 28, 1988, Anchorage chapter members Hubert, Lawrence Russell Hagel and Gerald G. Protzman were convicted of the misdemeanor charge of converting a government intelligence manual for their use, while Pailing and four other Alaskan Angels were acquitted. Other members of the Alaska and California chapters were convicted on state drug and firearm charges either side of the federal trial. The Hells Angels allegedly put a $1 million bounty on Tait\\'s life. Federal racketeering case. Four Alaskan Hells Angels – Montgomery David Elliott, Michael Hurn, Dale Leedom and William Spearman – were arrested by ATF agents on federal racketeering and firearms charges during raids at three homes in Anchorage and one in Two Rivers on December 3, 2003. HAMC clubhouses in Anchorage and North Pole were also searched. The charges, filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, stemmed from the River Run riot – a conflict between the Hells Angels and the Mongols on April 27, 2002, which left three bikers dead in Laughlin, Nevada – and followed a twenty-month ATF investigation of the club. The operation resulted in the arrests of a total of fifty-eight Hells Angels members and associates by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in Alaska and four other Western states for narcotics trafficking, firearms violations, possessing stolen explosives and various other crimes. Leedom, the Fairbanks chapter president, was one of six Hells Angels convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to face charges; he pleaded no contest to committing a violent crime in the aid of racketeering in October 2006 and was sentenced to two years in prison on February 13, 2007. Thirty-six others had charges against them dismissed. Violent incidents. Hells Angels member James William Leffel was convicted of first-degree assault for stabbing a man named Jens Schurig in the thigh, opening his femoral artery, outside a bar in Anchorage after Schurig allegedly denigrated Leffel\\'s motorcycle.On August 3, 2017, Michael \"Steak Knife\" Staton was kidnapped and taken to a duplex in Wasilla where he was tortured, beaten and killed by members of the 1488s – a white supremacist prison gang to which he belonged – after he was accused of stealing drugs and \"colors\" from Craig \"Oakie\" King, a Hells Angels member and 1488s associate. King and five 1488s members were arrested on March 27, 2019, and charged with murder, kidnapping and racketeering crimes including drug trafficking. On May 2, 2022, King was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy in aid of racketeering, murder in aid of racketeering, kidnapping resulting in death, and kidnapping conspiracy. King and four others were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in January 2023. Methamphetamine trafficking. Hells Angels member Charles Denver \"Pup\" Phillips and his wife Lois Latrilla Phillips were arrested after an FBI drug task force discovered twelve pounds of methamphetamine and almost $25,000 in cash at their apartment and in a nearby shipping container in Anchorage on August 10, 2018. Investigators also found a ledger listing money and quantities, and a list of names of Hells Angels prospects throughout the state. The couple were convicted of distributing and conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. On October 30, 2019, Charles Phillips was sentenced to eighteen years in federal prison, and his wife was sentenced to five years. Arizona. The HAMC has approximately a hundred members in Arizona and is classified as a criminal street gang by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS). The Arizona Hells Angels produce methamphetamine – independently and in conjunction with Mexican drug cartels – and also distribute the drug at retail level. The HAMC\\'s predecessor in the state, the Dirty Dozen, voted to merge with the Hells Angels in 1996 and officially \"patched over\" during a meeting in Oakland, California in October 1997. With the merger of the Dirty Dozen, the Hells Angels established six Arizona chapters, in Phoenix, Mesa, Tucson, Cave Creek and Flagstaff, as well as a nomads chapter. Methamphetamine trafficking. In June 2001, Greg \"Snake\" Surdukan and Chris \"Porker\" Baucum, president and vice-president of the Hells Angels\\' nomads chapter in Arizona, were arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) uncovered an international drug network involving the smuggling of methamphetamine into the United States from South Africa. The smuggling ring was allegedly established in November 1999 and involved South African Hells Angels members speed mailing methamphetamine hidden inside stuffed toys to their American counterparts in Flagstaff, from where it was distributed to other U.S. states. On June 17, 2002, Surdukan and Baucum pleaded guilty to drug trafficking; Surdukan was sentenced to fifteen years\\' imprisonment. Operation Black Biscuit. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) initiated an undercover investigation into the Arizona Hells Angels in September 2001 when Rudolph \"Rudy\" Kramer – a member of the Solo Angeles, a club based in Tijuana, Mexico with a small presence in southern California – agreed to become an informant and infiltrate other motorcycle gangs in exchange for the dismissal of charges against him after he was arrested by ATF agents for weapons violations. The investigation, known as Operation Black Biscuit, resulted in a twenty-one month infiltration of the club by a team of ATF agents, technicians and confidential informants. Kramer made contacts throughout the state as a dealer of methamphetamine and firearms, and he began collaborating with the Hells Angels in narcotics and weapons smuggling after fabricating a story that he was arming the Solo Angeles in Mexico to combat a Mongols chapter there. He sought permission from the HAMC to form a Solo Angeles nomads chapter in Arizona, which the ATF used to make contact with the Hells Angels. Kramer began introducing ATF agents posing as Solo Angeles bikers to Hells Angels leaders statewide after a meeting with Mesa chapter president Robert \"Bad Bob\" Johnston Jr. in July 2002. The drug-addicted Kramer eventually became a liability to the operation, however, and was returned to prison after the firearm indictment against him was reinstated in September 2002. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty, and he later entered protective custody. Information on Kramer\\'s role as an informant soon leaked, and Hells Angels leaders in Arizona also began hearing rumors from southern California that the Solo Angeles were imposters. In an effort to ensure credibility, undercover ATF agent Jay Dobyns told the Hells Angels in June 2003 that he and another Solo Angeles biker would be travelling to Sonora to kill Mongols. The ATF then staged the murder of a Mongols member by photographing and videotaping a law enforcement officer posing as the rival biker laying in a shallow grave, splattered with lamb blood and brains. Dobyns had bloodstained Mongols colors mailed to the Hells Angels from Mexico, and provided a videotape and pictures of the staged killing. The ruse proved successful and, according to Dobyns and the ATF, he was subsequently voted in as a member of the Hells Angels\\' Skull Valley chapter. Sonny Barger and the HAMC have vehemently denied that Dobyns was ever awarded membership.Operation Black Biscuit was ended prematurely because the ATF believed Robert \"Chico\" Mora, a senior member of the Hells Angels\\' Phoenix chapter, was plotting to murder the Solo Angeles. Mora did not know the Solo Angeles were undercover agents, but believed they were a potential rival encroaching on the Hells Angels\\' territory. He allegedly assembled a group of veteran Hells Angels enforcers to liquidate the Solo Angeles. The operation culminated with a series of synchronized raids carried out across Arizona on July 8, 2003, and the arrests of fifty-two people; sixteen Hells Angels members and associates were indicted on charges including RICO Act violations, murder and drug trafficking. Over 500 illegal weapons, including silencers, pipe bombs, sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, along with ammunition, $50,000 in cash and drugs were also seized. During one of the raids, on a HAMC clubhouse in North Phoenix, club prospect Michael Wayne Coffelt was shot and wounded with a rifle by police officer Laura Beeler. He was subsequently charged with aggravated assault against Beeler, who reported that Coffelt fired first and was cleared of any wrongdoing in the shooting by county prosecutors. The charges against Coffelt were dismissed in November 2004 when judge Michael Wilkinson of the Maricopa County Superior Court ruled that the police violated state search-and-seizure laws during the raid. Investigators determined that Coffelt never fired at Beeler. Operation Black Biscuit was deemed a success by the ATF, but internal government disagreement ultimately led to the sixteen defendants escaping conviction on the key charges of racketeering and murder. Half of the defendants plea bargained to lesser offenses, and five others had federal charges dismissed. The plea agreements resulted in no more than five-year prison sentences. In 2004, Mora was convicted of the federal charge of possessing body armor with intent to sell and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. The conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded as a result of the investigation. Murder of Cynthia Garcia. On October 27, 2001, full-patch Hells Angels members Kevin J. Augustiniak and Michael Christopher \"Mesa Mike\" Kramer, and prospective member Paul Merle Eischeid murdered Cynthia Yvonne Garcia, a forty-four-year-old mother of six who verbally disrespected the club and its members while in an intoxicated state during a party at the Hells Angels\\' clubhouse in Mesa. After beating Garcia unconscious, the three bikers loaded her into the trunk of a car and drove her into the desert near the Salt River where they stabbed her twenty-seven times and attempted to decapitate her. Garcia\\'s body was discovered on October 31. Kramer contacted ATF agent John Ciccone the following month and, without disclosing his crime, offered to become an informant. After moving to Los Angeles, California and infiltrating the club\\'s San Fernando Valley chapter by posing as an Arizona drug runner, Kramer offered the ATF information on Garcia\\'s killing in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Fourteen months after becoming an informant, he signed a plea agreement to serve five years of probation for the murder. Eischeid fled the country following his indictment for the killing in 2007 and was placed on the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was apprehended in the San Isidro district of Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 3, 2011, after being tracked by the USMS, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and Interpol. Eischeid was extradited to Arizona in July 2018 after exhausting all of his appeals in the Argentine legal system. Augustiniak pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in October 2011 and was sentenced to twenty-three years and six months\\' imprisonment on March 30, 2012. Conflict with the Mongols. Joshua William Harber, a member of the Hells Angels chapter in Ventura, California, was shot in the face outside a bar in Cave Creek on June 8, 2002, and died later that day at John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix. Harber\\'s unidentified killer fled the scene in a car after the shooting. While Phoenix Police Department detectives investigated several motives for the murder, including the possibility of retaliation by the Mongols for the killing of a Mongol by the Hells Angels at the River Run riot in Laughlin, Nevada on April 27, 2002, the crime has become a cold case.Cave Creek Hells Angels chapter president Daniel Leroy \"Hoover\" Seybert was shot to death outside a bar in Phoenix on March 22, 2003. The autopsy report showed that Seybert was shot in the head at close range by a small caliber handgun which was located during the investigation in Seybert\\'s back pocket. The homicide has never been solved and there have been various theories regarding the reason for Seybert\\'s killing. It has been speculated that he was killed by the Mongols, by the Hells Angels as part of an internal conflict, or by the ATF in relation to Operation Black Biscuit. Two days after Seybert\\'s death, a Mongols member was stabbed in the back and wounded at a gas station in Reno, Nevada by a suspected Hells Angels member in a possible revenge attack.Seven Hells Angels – including the Tucson chapter president, the former Mesa chapter president and other leaders – were arrested in Arizona on various charges on December 3, 2003, following a two-year investigation of the club by the ATF. Five of those were indicted at the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on federal racketeering and firearms charges stemming from the River Run riot. The raids in Arizona were carried out as part of a coordinated operation which led to the arrests of at least fifty-five Hells Angels members and associates in five Western states by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Two Arizona Angels – Rodney Cox and Calvin Schaefer – were among six HAMC members convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to stand trial. Schaefer was sentenced to four years and three months in a federal prison on January 12, 2007, for committing a violent crime in the aid of racketeering. Cox was sentenced to two years\\' imprisonment on February 23, 2007, after pleading guilty to the same charge. Charges were dismissed against thirty-six others.Patrick Michael Eberhardt, treasurer of the Hells Angels\\' Cave Creek chapter, was shot dead and a club hangaround was wounded when a group of six Hells Angels were fired upon while riding their motorcycles in Phoenix on February 7, 2015. Earlier that day, a group of unidentified bikers had fired shots at members of the Mongols nearby. A Mongols member is one of the two suspects in Eberhardt\\'s unsolved murder.On August 17, 2016, Hells Angels Mesa chapter member Wayne Whitt opened fire outside a sports bar in Tempe, killing one Mongols member – Richard \"AZ Slick\" Garcia – and wounding another before fleeing on his motorcycle. The shooting followed a verbal altercation between the rival bikers inside the bar. Three surviving Mongols – Frank Gardea, John Magana and Efren Ontiveros – were arrested, although the Tempe Police Department declined to press charges against Whitt as the shooting was deemed self-defense. Conflict with the Vagos. Five Hells Angels and two members of the Desert Road Riders – a club founded in Bullhead City in 1993 that became a HAMC support club in 2002 – were arrested on December 2, 2009, by an AZDPS task force as part of Operation Quiet Riot, a six-month investigation into a turf war involving the Hells Angels, Desert Road Riders and Vagos in Mohave County. On April 11, 2012, four Hells Angels members – Stephen Helland, Dale Hormut, Rudolfo \"Rudy\" Martinez and Gerald Smith – were acquitted of rioting and assisting in a criminal street gang. Another, George \"Joby\" Walters, took a plea deal and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. The charges stemmed from an alleged riot involving the rival clubs at a bar in Bullhead City on June 11, 2009.Members of the Hells Angels were allegedly involved in a shoot-out with Vagos members in Chino Valley on August 21, 2010; over fifty shots were fired and at least five people were wounded, although no life-threatening injuries were reported. After dozens of law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, twenty-seven people were arrested on charges ranging from attempted murder and aggravated assault to participation in a criminal street gang. Charges against seven Hells Angels members – John Bernard, Kevin Christiansen, Kiley Hill, Robert Kittredge, Michael Koepke, Larry Scott, Jr. and Bruce Schweigert – were dismissed in June 2012 after it transpired that Alfred Acevedo, the only direct witness to the confrontation between the gangs immediately before the shooting, was a Vagos hangaround working as an informant for AZDPS detective John Morris, and who had previously tried to infiltrate the Hells Angels and was rebuked. Other incidents. Hells Angels member Nathaniel Barton Sample was convicted in September 2009 of aggravated assault and acting for the benefit of a street gang following an incident at a Scottsdale bar on March 28, 2008, in which he and another man, Jose Cano, attacked an unidentified third man who had accidentally bumped into them. The case marked the first time the HAMC had been labelled a gang in the state of Arizona.Former Tucson Hells Angels chapter president William Gary \"Tramp\" Potter, who was expelled from the club due to his methamphetamine use and also because he was suspected of being a government informant, was arrested after deputies from the Pima County Sheriff\\'s Department found the body of Randall Scott Pfeil buried in his yard on July 13, 2010. Pfeil was the subject of a missing persons investigation and had been shot twice in the head. Potter pleaded guilty in April 2012 to second-degree murder and two counts of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. On June 4, 2012, he was sentenced to nineteen years in prison.Hells Angels Yavapai County chapter treasurer Bruce Schweigert, Sr. was sentenced to eight years in prison on August 12, 2014, after being convicted of threatening and intimidating as a criminal street gang member, assault, disorderly conduct and felony misconduct involving weapons, charges stemming from an August 2013 bar fight in Cottonwood. California. With over 300 members statewide, the Hells Angels are the most significant motorcycle gang in California in terms of membership and criminal activity. The club has a significant role in the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, and in other illegal enterprises. The West Coast faction of the HAMC has also been especially active in the infiltration of legitimate businesses, including motorcycle and automobile services, catering operations, bars, restaurants, and antique stores. Colorado. The Hells Angels have three chapters in Colorado. The club initiated its first chapter in the state on June 13, 2001, by amalgamating the Brothers Fast MC, a club founded in Denver in 1963. The HAMC inherited the Brothers Fast\\'s methamphetamine distribution operations and expanded into Colorado at a time when the Sons of Silence, historically the state\\'s preeminent motorcycle gang, were severely weakened as a result of a federal investigation. Violent incidents. On August 5, 1996, two members of the Hells Angels\\' San Fernando Valley, California chapter – Donald Dinehart and Larry Lajeunesse – were shot and wounded at the Iron Horse Inn in Steamboat Springs, which was hosting the club\\'s annual rally. Dinehart was airlifted to Denver Health Medical Center and underwent surgery for gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and chest, while Lajeunesse was treated at Routt Memorial Hospital after being shot in the hand. A member of the Ventura, California chapter was suspected of the shooting, which police believed was carried out as a punishment for a breach of club rules. HAMC members reportedly blocked police from entering the motel where the incident took place until after evidence had been removed. Over 200 Hells Angels attended the convention, and several beatings and a stabbing at local bars were also attributed to the bikers. By the end of the four-day rally, 160 police officers from 27 agencies had been drafted into Steamboat Springs to assist the 24 officers on duty in the town.A group of Hells Angels were allegedly involved in a bar fight with other patrons at the Black Nugget Saloon in Carbondale on November 19, 2005. The bikers were reportedly attending a benefit concert featuring several area punk rock bands to raise money to pay the legal fees of a prospective club member when they were provoked by a group of locals, resulting in a brawl. Kevin Hilgeford suffered a broken jaw and two broken ribs, while Kurt Trede, another patron purported to have been injured in the melee, left the bar before an ambulance arrived. Both men declined to press charges. Hilgeford denied being the instigator of the violence and claimed he was the victim of \"a jumping\".John Lockhart, a prospective member of the Hells Angels\\' LaSalle-based Colorado nomads chapter, was charged on June 19, 2017, with two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of vehicular eluding and illegal discharge of a firearm after a series of incidents in Weld County in which a gun was fired at two vehicles, including a police car. In the early hours of June 11, Lockhart shot from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle through the rear window of a sport utility vehicle driven by Faustino Garcia in a road rage incident in Greeley, before also firing at and hitting a pursuing police cruiser near Colorado State Highway 60 in Milliken. He was identified by investigators via surveillance video after being observed speeding in Greeley on June 13. On March 22, 2019, Lockhart was convicted of vehicular eluding, and acquitted of attempted first-degree murder and illegal discharge of a firearm. A mistrial was initially declared on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer, although he was subsequently convicted on June 26 in a retrial. On July 30, Lockhart was sentenced to 32 years\\' imprisonment for attempted murder, to run consecutively with a three-year sentence for the vehicular eluding conviction.Members of the Hells Angels and the Mongols engaged in a gun battle that started in the parking lot of the Jake\\'s Roadhouse bar and restaurant in Arvada on July 11, 2020, leaving Hells Angels member William \"Kelly\" Henderson dead from a gunshot wound, and three others injured. Dozens of shots were fired over a four-block area, and the suspects fled the scene before police arrived. Among the wounded was Ryan McPhearson, a member of a band playing in the bar that night who was hospitalized in critical condition with a brain injury after he was hit in the back of the head by an unknown assailant as he attempted to assist an injured man. Lawsuits against the police. The Hells Angels\\' Denver chapter clubhouse, located in the city\\'s Highlands neighborhood, was raided by the Denver Police Department (DPD) on July 31, 2001, and three club members were arrested. One was convicted of disobeying a lawful order, while charges were dismissed against the other two. In July 2002, eleven plaintiffs – ten HAMC members and the owner of the building housing the club\\'s headquarters – filed a federal lawsuit as a result of the warrantless search, alleging that police acted illegally and violated their constitutional rights. The Denver City Council approved a $50,000 settlement in September 2003 with eighteen claimants – the original eleven petitioners in addition to seven other Hells Angels who were detained  at a motorcycle swap meet in early 2003. Denver police chief Gerry Whitman also wrote the club a letter of apology.Hells Angels members Shiloh Frazier and Todd Zahn were arrested for possession of handguns after eight club members were pulled over by police for allegedly speeding while riding their motorcycles in Denver on September 2, 2005. Zahn pleaded guilty to possession of weapon by a previous offender, and charges against Frazier were dismissed. According to a federal lawsuit filed by the group in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on August 31, 2007, alleging an unconstitutional traffic stop and search without probable cause, the bikers were held at gunpoint and handcuffed, while dozens of police officers, including a SWAT team, and a police helicopter arrived at the scene after the officer who made the traffic stop called for reinforcements. On January 24, 2008, the police departments of Denver and adjacent Mountain View settled the lawsuit with a $14,000 payment, with Denver Manager of Safety Al LaCabe and Mountain View police chief Eric Gomez also signing apologies.HAMC member Anthony Mills filed a federal lawsuit in April 2020 against city of Greeley, the town of LaSalle and the Weld County Sheriff\\'s Office, as well as individual officers from those jurisdictions and from the Kersey and Garden City police departments in response to an April 8, 2018 incident in which LaSalle police officer David Miller joked about shooting Mills in order to get \"paid vacation\" after he had pulled him over for speeding. In September 2020, five police agencies paid $25,000 to Mills to settle the lawsuit. Miller issued an apology to Mills as part of the settlement, and resigned from the police department.Denver Hells Angels chapter member Dustin \"Dusty\" Ullerich filed a federal lawsuit on November 3, 2021, against Jefferson County, the cities of Golden, Aurora and Arvada, and sixteen individual police officers from four departments over injuries he suffered when police executed a no-knock warrant at his home in Golden on November 7, 2019, as part of an operation targeting fourteen bikers in an organized crime case. Ullerich was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma after being hit by a projectile when Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office deputy Anthony Brown discharged a short-barreled shotgun loaded with lock-breaking ammunition. Brown was cleared of wrongdoing in 2020. Organized crime. Twelve people were taken into custody after Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents and police SWAT teams raided nineteen locations in the Denver metropolitan area, Colorado Springs and Weld County, including the Denver Hells Angels chapter clubhouse, two tattoo shops and an automobile business, on November 7, 2019. Dozens of firearms, methamphetamine, cocaine, cash and passports were seized in the raids. Thirteen Hells Angels members and a fourteenth man affiliated with the Destroyers motorcycle gang were ultimately indicted on charges of assault, kidnapping, robbery, motor vehicle theft and chop shop activity in relation to a Denver-based organized crime ring. The five-month investigation into the ring involved eleven state and federal law enforcement agencies, and began in July 2019 after former HAMC member Joshua O\\'Bryan began offering investigators details on the Denver chapter\\'s alleged involvement with interstate drug trafficking, gunrunning, prostitution and money laundering. O\\'Bryan allegedly survived an ambush by a group of Hells Angels at a stashhouse in Erie on June 28, 2019, after he was expelled from the club due to suspicions he was cooperating with law enforcement, which emerged when he was arrested on firearms charges following a police raid on his motorcycle shop in Lakewood. In another alleged incident, on July 12, 2019, O\\'Bryan was beaten and kidnapped before having his club tattoos covered up at a Hells Angels-owned tattoo parlor in Englewood.One defendant in the case, William \"Kelly\" Henderson, was killed in a shootout with a rival motorcycle gang on July 11, 2020, before he could stand trial. William \"Curly\" Whitney received a two-year deferred sentence after pleading guilty to possessing an explosive. Charges were dismissed against Michael Dire. Connecticut. Violent incidents. Connecticut is home to three HAMC chapters, in Bridgeport, Hartford and Middletown. The Bridgeport chapter was the first to be established, following a patch-over of the Grateful Dead Motorcycle Club in 1975. The Connecticut Hells Angels have been recruited as enforcers and contract killers for the Mafia.On February 7, 1975, Bridgeport Police Department patrol officer John McGee issued a member of the Hells Angels\\' Bridgeport chapter with a citation for speeding on his motorcycle. While driving home at the end of his shift that evening, McGee observed a stalled vehicle and stopped to assist the occupants when he was attacked by three men and beaten with a baseball bat. He suffered major head injuries and was hospitalized in critical condition. A Hells Angels member was convicted of the assault and sentenced to a year in prison, while two others had charges against them dismissed.Police raided the Bridgeport Hells Angels chapter clubhouse on May 7, 1975, and arrested five members – John J. Miller, Frank Passalaqua, Robert L. Redmond, Nicholas Romano Jr. and Joseph \"Crazy Joe\" Whelan – on charges of first-degree manslaughter in connection with the death of José Sosa, whom police determined was pulled from his automobile and beaten to death after being involved in a near collision with a vehicle operated by one of the bikers in the early hours of May 2, 1975. Sosa died of multiple head and internal injuries, and his body was found in the back of his parked car by three passing youths the following afternoon. Three other Hells Angels – Jack Forbes, Russell J. Kutzer and Carlos Pini – were later apprehended on the same charges.Bridgeport Hells Angels members Frank D\\'Amato and Salvatore Saffioti were killed and another, Donald \"Big Red\" Meredith, was left wounded in critical condition when they were shot with a .44 Magnum carbine by Donald E. Krosky after they forced their way into a hotel and bar in Sandy Hook, Newtown on July 31, 1975. The three Hells Angels, armed with knives, had been contracted by the building\\'s owner Charles Framularo to evict Krosky, who rented and managed the premises. Krosky, who was associated with the rival Huns Motorcycle Club, was charged with two counts of murder and one count of assault with intent to murder on November 10, 1975; he was freed on a $100,000 bail bond. After receiving several anonymous death threats, Krosky was shot dead with a shotgun when another vehicle pulled up alongside his car while he was stopped at a traffic light in Trumbull on July 20, 1976. A woman passenger, Jean Ann McDaid, was also hospitalized. No one has ever been arrested for Krosky\\'s murder, although police believe the gunman was Meredith.Frank Passalaqua was one of four white inmates investigated over the homicide of Alfred Chisholm, a black inmate who was strangled to death at Northern Correctional Institution on November 10, 1977.Bridgeport Hells Angels chapter president Daniel Eugene \"Diamond Dan\" Bifield, along with Susan Corin Bouton, was arrested by local police officers in Milford on October 3, 1979, after being observed with a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun in his vehicle. A .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun was also found in Bouton\\'s possession. Bifield was on probation for a 1975 assault on a policeman at the time. He was convicted of possession of a shotgun by a convicted felon in October 1980 and was sentenced to two years in prison on November 20, 1980.Joseph Whelan fatally stabbed bar patron John Matulionis after a verbal altercation in a Bridgeport barroom on February 24, 1980. He was sentenced to twenty-five-years-to-life in prison for the murder.Hells Angels sergeant-at-arms Daniel \"Dan\" Klimas shot and killed Todd Festa, a rejected club prospect and state police informant, in Wallingford on January 7, 1998. Klimas pleaded guilty to murder and possession of a pistol without a permit, and was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison on March 3, 2000.Roger Mariani, a senior member of the Hells Angels in Connecticut, was shot and killed while riding his motorcycle on the Connecticut Turnpike in West Haven on April 2, 2006. The shooting happened after a group of over twenty motorcyclists was involved in an altercation with four men travelling in a sport utility vehicle. Another Hells Angels member, Paul Carrol, was also wounded when shots were fired from the car. Within hours of Mariani\\'s killing, two Hells Angels – Trevor Delaware and Jeffrey Richard – were arrested near the home of an Outlaws member in Enfield, in possession of weapons including knives and a loaded gun as well as pages from a classified state police manual that lists identities and addresses of gang members. The pair were charged with weapons possession and theft of a license plate.The Hells Angels are considered suspects in the murder of Joseph \"HoJo\" Ferraiolo, the president of the Outlaws\\' Waterbury chapter, who died from multiple gunshot wounds after being ambushed outside a tattoo parlor he owned in Hamden on February 9, 2010. No one has ever been arrested in the case, which police consider an open investigation.Hells Angels associate Howard Hammer was contracted by loanshark James Broderick III to collect a $1,500 loan from a delinquent debtor in late December 2015. When the individual failed to pay the debt and falsely claimed to be the acting president of the New York Hells Angels chapter, he was stabbed eight times, beaten with a hammer and blinded in one eye in a New Milford hotel room on January 25, 2016. Broderick and Hammer were arrested on May 27, 2016. Hammer refused to identify those involved in the assault, although an investigation revealed that members of the Hells Angels\\' Bridgeport chapter had attacked the victim in connection with the extortion scheme. Hammer pleaded guilty to conspiracy to participate in the collection and attempted collection of an extension of credit by extortionate means on December 2, 2016, and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years\\' imprisonment on June 1, 2017. Broderick pleaded guilty to the same charge on December 7, 2016, and was sentenced to two years\\' on June 29, 2017. Racketeering. Daniel Bifield and two Bridgeport Hells Angels associates, including Daniel\\'s father Richard Bifield, were convicted of conspiring to make and collect extortionate loans, and Hobbs Act violations on August 4, 1981, for their involvement in a loansharking operation headed by Francis \"Fat Franny\" Curcio, a made member of the Genovese crime family. As an inmate awaiting sentencing, Daniel Bifield and three others escaped from the Bridgeport Correctional Center on September 23, 1981. He became the subject of an international manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and, at one point, a body found in the East River in New York City was incorrectly identified as that of Bifield. After spending several weeks in the United States, he fled to the Bahamas. Successfully managing to elude his pursuers, Bifield finally returned to the U.S. in late January 1982 and went to Denver, Colorado, where he was eventually apprehended by United States Marshals Service (USMS) and FBI agents on February 5, 1982. Bifield was sentenced two weeks after his capture to two consecutive twenty-year prison sentences on the extortion charge. He was then found guilty on June 10, 1982, of escape from the custody of the United States Attorney General, and was sentenced to an additional five years\\' imprisonment to be served consecutively.Thirty-seven members and associates of the Bridgeport Hells Angels were arrested on racketeering and drug trafficking charges on May 2, 1985, in connection with a three-year FBI investigation of the club known as Operation Roughrider. The arrests took place in three cities across Connecticut. Among those indicted was an officer of the Bridgeport PD, Joseph Seamons. Two law enforcement officers were injured during the raids; state trooper Angel Gonzalez was wounded when a suspect fired at him through the door of a house in Stratford, and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official suffered a broken toe while using a sledgehammer to break through an armored clubhouse door in Bridgeport. An undercover FBI agent, Kevin P. Bonner, infiltrated the club for over two years and made drug deals with various chapters during the investigation. The operation involved around a thousand law enforcement personnel, and resulted in the arrests of a total of 133 Hells Angels members and associates during approximately fifty coordinated raids carried out in eleven states. The raids also led to the seizure of $2.6 million worth of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, hashish, PCP and LSD, as well as weapons including Uzi submachine guns and rocket launchers. Thirty-five of those charged were convicted – including Roger \"Bear\" Mariani, Robert \"Red Dog\" Redmann and Joseph Whelan, who were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. One Hells Angel, Robert Banning, became a cooperating witness. In 1986, detective Nicholas Barone of the Connecticut State Police received intelligence indicating that he and H. James Pickerstein, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, were to be physically harmed by the HAMC in retaliation for their efforts in the investigation and subsequent prosecutions. These attempts at violence were to be funded by the Hells Angels\\' Oakland, California chapter. As a result, Barone was subject to intense security for an extended period of time. Illinois. Four leading members of the Hells Angels in northern Illinois were arrested and charged with numerous crimes including violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 2005, following a four-year federal investigation into the club. At least three were convicted; Melvin \"Road\" Chancey (president of the Chicago chapter from 1997 to 1999) was sentenced to nine years in prison, David G. \"Pulley\" Ohlendorf (president of the Spring Valley chapter from 2003) was sentenced to four years in prison and Richard A. Abrams (a former president of both the Rockford and Spring Valley chapters) was sentenced to three years in prison during trials in June and July 2006. Their group carried out the June 25, 1994 shooting of a rival club president in Cook County, threatened to bomb a rival gang\\'s clubhouse in Kankakee in March 1995, and planned two murders in Peoria and Joliet, crimes they committed to protect sales of cocaine and methamphetamine with a street value of $624,000 from 1993 through 2002. Indiana. In 2016, law enforcement received public backlash for heavily patrolling the area where the HAMC was holding a charity for educational programs for children with special needs. Citizens took issue with authorities summoning the Chicago area\\'s SWAT team and helicopter unit for the relatively small bike night, which attracted about eighty motorcycles to the small bar where the event was hosted. One HAMC member summed up the public\\'s feelings in an interview:. \"As far as what we view as the excessive law enforcement build-up that\\'s always present at our events, they\\'ve made it clear to us that they don\\'t want motorcycle clubs in Porter County ... We do understand the need for law enforcement in our society, however what happened Thursday night was a waste of their talents and a waste of our tax dollars.\". The Angel then once again reaffirmed that the main purpose of his club was for men to ride motorcycles together and that this was a purely charitable event. He then spoke about how his chapter is working to support the communities that support his club. Kentucky. In October 1988, Ralph \"Sonny\" Barger, the Hells Angels\\' Oakland (California) chapter president and reputed national leader, and Michael Vincent \"Irish\" O\\'Farrell, the former Oakland president, were convicted of plotting to carry out bomb attacks in Louisville and elsewhere against members of the Outlaws. Three other club members were also found guilty on lesser charges, while five others were acquitted. The government contended the Hells Angels planned the attacks in revenge for the murder of John Cleve Webb, a member of Hells Angels\\' Anchorage (Alaska) chapter, who was shot outside a Jefferson County bar on August 12, 1986. A Louisville Outlaws member later pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in Webb\\'s death. Maryland. Pagans member Christopher J. Brennan shot and wounded three Hells Angels at a bar in Deale on May 30, 2002, when he fired shots from a van with a .32 caliber pistol.

Federal agents uncovered seventeen firearms, over 270 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest and methamphetamine during the raids. According to affidavits filed in federal court, two undercover ATF agents who had infiltrated the Warlocks witnessed Beal sell cocaine to two Warlocks members at the Hells Angels\\' clubhouse on May 3, 2003.

The HAMC has established chapters in Lowell, Lynn, Salem, Cape Cod (headquartered in Buzzards Bay) and Berkshire County (headquartered in Lee). The \"Bad Company\" chapter in Lowell, founded in 1966, was the club\\'s first branch on the East Coast. The Hells Angels are the most significant motorcycle gang involved in drug trafficking in Massachusetts, and have also collaborated with the Boston faction of the Patriarca crime family in loansharking and narcotics distribution. Violent incidents. Hells Angels members were among a group of twenty people – fifteen men and five women – charged with various offenses after a battle with police on Lowell\\'s Andover Street on December 14, 1969. The violence erupted when police officers arrived at a house party in response to complaints from neighbors and were threatened with a rifle. Around forty-five officers, including reinforcements from neighboring towns, were required to arrest the group. Five police officers were injured and a patrol wagon was damaged in the incident. Several rifles and a sawed-off shotgun were seized along with clubs and daggers, as well as barbiturates. Three Hells Angels – Alan J. \"Big Al\" Hogan, Philip W. Jones and Michael Maguire – were charged with assault with intent to murder.Hells Angels member Alan Hogan, along with Gilbert LaRocque and Joseph F. Quartarone, Jr., abducted Linda Condon outside a bar in Beverly in the early hours of August 9, 1975 and forcefully took the keys to her Newburyport apartment, which she shared with her husband Theodore Condon, a member or former member of the Hells Angels. While LaRocque held Linda Condon captive in the back seat of Quartarone\\'s Cadillac, Hogan and Quartarone – a police officer in the city of Beverly – entered the apartment and beat Theodore Condon with clubs, inflicting severe injuries including fractures of the femur and of both tibiae, a severe contusion of the left side of his face, a through-and-through laceration of his left ear, a perforated left ear-drum, and a fractured skull. Linda Condon was then taken to a motel room in Peabody, where she escaped through a window and called for the police after LaRocque fell asleep. The trio were convicted of kidnapping, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and mayhem. The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed all convictions because, in its view, the trial judge improperly forbade cross-examination of the Condons designed to show bias because criminal charges stemming from a 1971 drug indictment were pending against them at the time.In September 1984, Salem Hells Angels chapter member Billy Leary and another motorcyclist were arrested by the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) for operating under the influence after leaving a nightclub in Revere. Leary was subsequently charged with three counts of assault and battery, and three counts of making threats after an incident occurred when officers attempted to strip search him at a Peabody police station. He was ultimately acquitted.Two Hells Angels were accused of raping a woman at the Lynn chapter\\'s clubhouse during the 1997 funeral of former chapter president Alan Hogan.Salem Hells Angels members James Costin and Thomas M.

Police eventually coaxed Ranieri out of the swamp and arrested him on several charges. He was given a ninety-day suspended sentence for assault on a police officer.Eric Franco, the sergeant-at-arms of the Lynn Hells Angels chapter, was found to be in possession of a firearm and ammunition on May 3, 2011, when police were called to the apartment he shared with his girlfriend and her child after receiving a report that Franco had assaulted his girlfriend. Franco\\'s criminal record in Massachusetts includes three convictions for assault and battery by a dangerous weapon, as well as convictions for indecent assault and battery, failure to register as a sex offender, breaking and entering at night with intent to commit a felony, and conspiracy to violate the controlled substances act. Franco was also convicted in Arkansas for battery in the second degree in a case in which he and five other Hells Angels assaulted and stabbed four Bandidos members. He was convicted in September 2012 of possessing a firearm and ammunition after receiving a felony conviction, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison on March 12, 2013.Two members of the Hells Angels\\' Salem chapter – Marc Eliason and Sean Barr, the chapter president – were arrested on charges of kidnapping, mayhem and extortion on March 13, 2013, along with Nikolis Avelis and Brian Weymouth – two members of the Byfield chapter of the Red Devils, a Hells Angels support club. Two others were also later apprehended. The charges related to the assault of a former Red Devils member, who was forced to resign from the club after failing to assault an expelled member of the Salem Hells Angels as ordered by superiors. The victim was lured to the Red Devils\\' Byfield clubhouse on October 15, 2012, where he was interrogated before being knocked unconscious and having his hand broken with a ball-peen hammer, causing permanent injury. His motorcycle was also stolen. After being threatened by Red Devils members into delivering the title to the stolen motorcycle, he went into hiding and eventually contacted the FBI. Barr, Eliason, Weymouth and another Hells Angel, Robert DeFronzo, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit violent crimes, maiming, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting serious bodily injury and racketeering in February 2015. Barr and Eliason were each sentenced to eight years\\' imprisonment, while DeFronzo and Weymouth were sentenced to four years\\'. Conflicts. David A. Urban, a Hells Angels member from Buffalo, New York, was fatally shot in the heart after an unidentified gunman fired four rounds from a pistol into a bar in Lynn on April 23, 1974. Mark W. Veherbon, a Menlo Park, California Hells Angel, was also wounded after being shot three times in the stomach and leg, while two other club members escaped unharmed. Although the murder has been unsolved, Lynn police have speculated that the shooting stemmed from a conflict with a fledgling rival club, Lucifer\\'s Henchmen MC, and an incident at a local café on April 7, in which the son of the café proprietor, Thomas Abernathy Jr., was allegedly stabbed by two Hells Angels. The HAMC reportedly emerged victorious in the feud, seizing the colors of ten or eleven Lucifer\\'s Henchmen members. Another three rival bikers fled the state. One of the Hells Angels charged with the non-fatal stabbing, \"Whiskey\" George Hartman, Jr., was murdered in Florida on April 30 before he could face trial.

The following evening, three friends of Rich – Robert L. Cobb, Arthur A. Corbett and Andrew J. Millyan – went to the bar seeking revenge on any Hells Angels present. Millyan shot bar patron Dana Hill in the head with a shotgun. Hill – who was not a member of any motorcycle gang, but had the appearance of a biker – died three days later. After discarding the murder weapon in a body of water, Cobb, Corbett and Millyan were arrested by police and indicted on first-degree murder charges on the theory of joint enterprise. On May 19, 1982, Corbett and Millyan were convicted of murder in the first degree; Cobb was convicted of murder in the second degree. The trio were sentenced to life in prison.Two Hells Angels members were stabbed in Revere on November 8, 1991, allegedly by Devil\\'s Disciples members.Hells Angels members Michael J.

Michele Gagnon, a member of the Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels, is believed to be a prime suspect in two unsolved murders that occurred in Lynn in 1979. Gagnon\\'s girlfriend Susan Marie DeQuina, who reportedly wanted to break up with Gagnon because he and his friends were using her car to transport drugs, went missing on October 3, 1979. Shortly after her disappearance, DeQuina\\'s car was found abandoned and burned in Saugus. Authorities believe she was murdered. On November 4, 1979, the dismembered torso of Robert \"Bino\" Garbino, Gagnon\\'s roommate and a Hells Angels prospect, was discovered by children playing in a dump near where DeQuina\\'s car was found. He had been shot in the head, back and shoulder, and his severed head and hands were later found buried in the yard of his Lynn residence. Police suspect Garbino was killed by the Hells Angels over a drug rip-off, and began searching for Gagnon in relation to the murder. He was found shot to death in an apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut on November 25, 1979. His death was ruled a suicide, although some authorities believe he did not take his own life.Hells Angels members Alan J. Cutler and Edward R. Simard, and another man – John L. Burke – were arrested on February 4, 1986, in connection with the murder of Vincent DeNino, a drug dealer who was found shot dead in the trunk of his car in a supermarket parking lot in Revere on February 29, 1984. According to police, DeNino refused to pay Simard approximately $10,000 owed over a cocaine deal and, after learning that the Hells Angels had put a contract out on his life, sought protection from the rival Trampers MC. With approval from both clubs, he was allegedly lured to Cutler\\'s home and shot in the shoulder with a shotgun before being taken to his car and shot four times in the head. A fourth suspect, Trampers associate and future Patriarca crime family soldier Darin F. \"Nino\" Bufalino, fled to Kingscourt, Ireland before being apprehended in Fuengirola, Spain, on June 11, 1987. Charges of first-degree murder against Bufalino, Burke and Simard were dismissed on December 10, 1990, when a judge ruled Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wiretap evidence in the case to be inadmissible because there had been an eight-day delay in sealing the tapes.Berkshire County Hells Angels chapter sergeant-at-arms Adam Lee Hall, along with Caius Veiovis (born Roy Gutfinski Jr.) and Aryan Brotherhood member David Chalue, kidnapped Robert Chadwell, Edward Frampton and David Glasser – Chalue\\'s roommate – from Frampton\\'s home in Pittsfield during the early hours of August 28, 2011 before fatally shooting them. Their bodies, dismembered with an electric circular saw, were discovered in Becket ten days later. Glasser was killed to prevent him testifying against Hall in an unrelated assault case, and Chadwell and Frampton were killed to eliminate witnesses.

When Pritzert told them the goods were not ready, they began abusing him, waking Pritzert\\'s girlfriend who was asleep in the rear of the store. While some members guarded the store owner, others took turns beating and raping the girl. After approximately six hours, Pritzert managed to escape and alerted police. The girl identified her alleged attackers in a police lineup. The eight men – Robert Cardner, Robert Marshall and Car Paretta from Massachusetts, Thomas Fusco, Edward Robinson and Kevin Seymour from New York state, Kurt Groudle from Ohio, and James Ordfield from New York City – were charged with rape, sodomy, unlawful imprisonment and criminal trespassing. Assault, murder, and conflict with rival clubs. College student Bruce Meyer was shot five times in the head at point-blank range with a .22 caliber handgun fitted with a silencer in the parking lot of his apartment building in Brewster on December 14, 1975. Law enforcement sources stated that Meyer was murdered by the former president of the Connecticut Hells Angels chapter in retaliation for him killing a Hells Angels member in a car crash on July 3, 1975.In September 1994, near Buffalo at the Lancaster Speedway drag races, there was a clash between the Hells Angels and a rival biker gang resulting in two deaths, and multiple injuries.. On January 28, 2007, a woman named Roberta Shalaby was found badly beaten on the sidewalk outside the Hells Angels\\' clubhouse at 77 East Third Street in the East Village, Manhattan. The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover the entrance to the New York chapter\\'s East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains nobody knows how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door. A club lawyer said they intended to sue the city of New York for false arrest and possible civil rights violations. Drug trafficking. A methamphetamine trafficking network run by members and associates of the Hells Angels\\' Rochester chapter operating in Western New York from 2002 through July 9, 2010 was dismantled after an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Genesee County Sheriff\\'s Office, the New York State Police, the City of Batavia Police Department, and the Village of LeRoy Police Department. James Henry McAuley, Jr., the vice-president of the Rochester chapter and the leader of the drug ring, was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison in July 2016. Richard W. Mar, the former president of the club\\'s Monterey (California) chapter, supplied the Rochester Hells Angels with methamphetamine and trafficked the drug to New York from California; he was sentenced to ten years in federal prison in August 2016. Rochester Hells Angels members Richard E. Riedman and Jeffrey A. Tyler, and three associates – Donna Boon (McAuley\\'s wife), Gordon Montgomery and Paul Griffin – pleaded guilty to drug trafficking offenses based on their roles in the conspiracy; Riedman was sentenced to thirty-seven months in prison, Tyler to eighteen months in prison, Boon to three years probation and twelve months of home incarceration, Montgomery to sixty months in prison, and Griffin to probation. Additionally, Rochester Hells Angels member Robert W. \"Bugsy\" Moran, Jr. was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and Gina Tata was sentenced to three years probation, while Timothy M. Stone was sentenced to twelve months in prison on charges related to the case. North Carolina. North Carolina\\'s first Hells Angels chapter was founded in Durham on July 24, 1973. This was then followed by the Charlotte chapter, which was chartered on October 19, 1978, and was formed by Michael Franklin \"Thunder\" Finazzo – a member of the Hells Angels\\' elite \"Filthy Few\" from Omaha, Nebraska – and others. Charlotte was home to numerous motorcycle gangs at the time, including the Outlaws, but under Finazzo\\'s leadership, the Hells Angels were able to take control of much of the city\\'s criminal rackets and operated drug, prostitution and motorcycle theft rings throughout the state. During the Hells Angels\\' international rally held at a private campground on Kerr Lake on July 4, 1981, journalists covering the event for The Charlotte Observer were assaulted by Hells Angels members. Staff reporters Robin Clark and Tex O\\'Neill were punched and photographer Mark Sluder was forced to turn over his film at knifepoint. The attack was stopped when O\\'Neill alerted FBI agents who were also observing the rally. Michael Finazzo and his lieutenant Tyler Duris \"Yank\" Frndak were found shot dead and stuffed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile 88 in Randolph County on September 26, 1981. At the time, Finazzo was considered by police to be among the ten most powerful members of the club. Although the murders remain unsolved, police believe that the killings were related to a feud with the Outlaws or a power struggle within the Hells Angels. Club members from across the United States, as well as Canada, Denmark, England and the Netherlands, attended the burials of both men, which took place in Marshville on October 1, 1981. Finazzo\\'s successor as chapter president, Fred Martin Scarnechia, and another Hells Angel, Thomas Lee Campbell, pistol-whipped undercover DEA agent John Landrum amidst a scuffle during a drug deal sting operation, in which Scarnechia was also stabbed, at Scarnechia\\'s home in Fort Mill, South Carolina on July 27, 1982. Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an explosive ordnance disposal unit from the Fort Jackson Army base was required to disarm the trap. Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting the federal agent on January 6, 1983. The Charlotte chapter was at one point the Hells Angels\\' largest on the east coast, with approximately a dozen members and numerous associates, but was disbanded after its position became precarious following the murders of Finazzo and Frndak, and the imprisonment of Scarnechia. The chapter clubhouse, known as \"the Bunker\", was burned down in a suspected arson attack on August 12, 1985. Investigators believe that the Hells Angels themselves destroyed the property before their departure. Ohio. The United States Department of Justice has stated that the Hells Angels have been involved in contract killings and drug trafficking with the Cleveland crime family.The New York chapter of the Hells Angels was involved in a large-scale brawl with the Breed, in which knives, chains and clubs were brandished, at a motorcycle trade show in Cleveland on March 6, 1971. The violence led to the deaths of five bikers; Breed members Bruce Emerick, Andrew Demeter, Amelio Gardull and Thomas A. Terry, and Hells Angels member Jeffrey \"Groover\" Coffey. Twenty-three people were also injured, including three police officers. Eighty-four people were arrested at the scene. On March 9, forty-seven Breed members and ten Hells Angels were each charged with five counts of first-degree murder. The feud between the two clubs reportedly began two years earlier after a fight in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and continued during the following two decades.On February 27, 1988, David Hartlaub was murdered in his van at a bank parking lot near the Musicland record store that he managed as he was dropping off the nightly deposit. The deposit bag contained about $4000 in cash and was not taken. Three members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang; Steven Wayne Yee, Mark Verdi, and John Ray Bonds were carrying out a hit. The Cleveland Hells Angels were planning to retaliate against a Sandusky Outlaw gang member for the Joliet, IL shooting of a Hells Angels member the previous year, at which Bonds had been present. The Outlaw member drove a van almost identical to Hartlaub\\'s. The trio mistook Hartlaub\\'s van for their  and shot and killed him by mistake. Both the gun and the van\\'s carpet were spattered with blood, allowing police to use DNA evidence, and discovered that John Ray Bonds was the shooter who had hid inside Hartlaub\\'s van and was waiting to kill him. He shot him with a MAC-11 9-mm semi-automatic pistol fitted with a homemade silencer. Bonds\\'s DNA profile analyzed by the FBI matched the bloodstains found in Yee\\'s car and based on this they were able to use it as key evidence. This was one of the first cases of DNA being used for criminal conviction. The trial and legal wrangling lasted nearly two years and ended in long prison terms for all three Hells Angels members, who remain in prison on sentences up to life. Mark Verdi was released in 2019. Oregon. Police have stated that the Hells Angels have avoided Oregon since 1967, when the state was ceded to the Gypsy Jokers to quell a San Francisco, California-area drug war between the clubs.Hells Angels prospect Robert \"Bugeye Bob\" McClure was convicted of quadruple murder and sentenced to four consecutive life terms in July 1994 for the shootings of Margo Compton, her six-year-old twin daughters, Sylvia and Sandra, and Gary Seslar, the son of her boyfriend, in Gaston on August 7, 1977. McClure\\'s alleged accomplice in the killings, Hells Angels hangaround Benjamin \"Psycho\" Silva, was never charged in the case; prosecutors felt it wasn\\'t worth the expense and effort as he was already on death row for the 1981 kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of two college students in Lassen County, California. Odis \"Buck\" Garrett, the Hells Angels Vallejo, California chapter president, ordered the killings of Compton and her daughters in retaliation for her testimony against several Hells Angels in a 1976 San Francisco prostitution trial. Garrett, a one-time millionaire methamphetamine dealer already serving a life term in California on a narcotics conviction, was found guilty on four counts of murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences in prison in July 1995. Garrett died in prison aged seventy-four on February 12, 2017. Pennsylvania. An alliance between the Pagans and the Philadelphia crime family has historically prevented the Hells Angels from establishing a presence in the Philadelphia area. In March 2002, a South Philadelphia tattoo parlor owned by a Pagans member who had been involved in a brawl with the Hells Angels on Long Island, New York the previous month was firebombed in what authorities suspect was a retaliatory attack by the Angels. A HAMC member was stabbed numerous times during a fight between the rival clubs in Northeast Philadelphia in November 2002. The unattended clubhouse of the Sons of Satan, a Pagans support club, was destroyed by a pipe bomb explosion in Rapho Township on December 13, 2002. The case has yet to be officially solved, although authorities believe it to be the work of the Hells Angels.A HAMC chapter was formed in West Philadelphia in 2004 after four high-ranking Pagans members – Mark \"Slow Poke\" Mangano, Anthony \"Mint-Condition\" Mengine, Thomas \"Thinker\" Wood and James \"Slim Jim\" Wysong – patched over the year before. On January 1, 2005, Hells Angels member Vincent \"Honcho\" Heinrich was airlifted to Cooper University Hospital after being assaulted by a group of Pagans outside a bar in Woodland Township, New Jersey, allegedly prompting the Angels\\' New York-based East Coast leader John \"The Baptist\" Lo Franco to declare war on the Philadelphia Pagans chapter. Wood, the Philadelphia Hells Angels vice-president, was shot dead while driving his GMC pickup truck on the Schuylkill Expressway after he and fellow HAMC member Byron \"B&E\" Evans departed a go-go bar in the early hours of January 15, 2005. Two men in a Chevrolet Suburban began firing at Evans, who was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and Wood swerved in an attempt to shield Evans when he was fatally shot in the head. Pagans members Robert \"Go Fast\" Gray and Steven \"Gorilla\" Mondevergine were questioned by police in relation to the murder, which has gone unsolved. On October 31, 2005, Pagans members allegedly stole a sign standing in front of the Hells Angels\\' clubhouse, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. The Philadelphia Hells Angels chapter, consisting of twelve members and approximately five prospects, was disbanded during a meeting in New York on November 18, 2005. Law enforcement believe the demise of the chapter was a result of poor leadership by LoFranco, who ordered the outmatched Hells Angels to carry out a war against the better-established Pagans. Rhode Island. The Hells Angels\\' Rhode Island chapter was formed in Providence on September 5, 1992. The Hells Angels have established a working relationship with the Providence faction of the Patriarca crime family, acting as enforcers for the Mafia.Christian A. Rufino, a member of the New Rochelle, New York (\"New Roc City\") chapter of the Hells Angels, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison after being convicted on a federal firearms charge in April 2012. He was found to be in possession of cocaine, a loaded handgun and additional ammunition after a traffic stop in Cranston in December 2009.Hells Angels member Douglas Leedham was sentenced to seven years in prison in July 2019 after pleading guilty to trafficking methamphetamine and cocaine, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He was arrested in February that year when a court-authorized search of his North Providence home uncovered thirty-nine grams of methamphetamine, nineteen grams of cocaine, two handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, body armor, dozens of knives and hatchets, brass knuckles, more than $6,000 in cash and material used in the packaging and distribution of drugs. South Carolina. The Hells Angels\\' first chapter in the Southern States was established in Charleston on February 7, 1976.Artie Ray Cherry, a founding member of the Charleston chapter and a Special Forces veteran of the Vietnam War, died from a gunshot wound to the head after being shot during a bar brawl in Rock Hill in the early hours of January 7, 1982. Three other men were also injured during the melee, and Mack McClendon Teal – a man believed by police to have had a long association with gangs and nightclubs in the area – was charged with Cherry\\'s murder. Cherry was killed in an apparent attempt to take over a bar from Teal. At the time of his death, Cherry was wanted by police for the murder of Carl Billingham, who died five days after being stabbed in the groin during a fight with four men at a nightclub in Charleston County in October 1979.Fred Martin Scarnechia, the president of the Hells Angels\\' Charlotte, North Carolina chapter, and another club member, Thomas Lee Campbell, pistol-whipped and broke the nose of undercover DEA agent John Landrum when a sting operation drug deal went awry at Scarnechia\\'s home in Fort Mill on July 27, 1982. Scarnechia was also stabbed during the skirmish. Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an Army explosive ordnance disposal unit from Fort Jackson was required to disarm the trap. On January 6, 1983, Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting Landrum.Sixteen members and associates of the Hells Angels\\' South Carolina Nomads chapter, which operated from clubhouses in Lexington and Rock Hill, were convicted of crimes related to the RICO Act following a two-year cooperative investigation by the FBI, ATF, South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and four local police departments. The investigation revealed that the group engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, firearms trafficking, violent crimes, attempted armed robbery, arson, and other offenses. In excess of one hundred guns (including fully automatic machine guns, silencers, assault rifles with high-capacity magazines, pistols, and sawed-off shotguns) were trafficked by the group and recovered during the execution of search warrants, and members of the organization also supplied methamphetamine, cocaine, bath salts and prescription pain pills.. The Hells Angels\\' leadership coordinated the criminal activity and received kickbacks from proceeds generated by members and associates of the chapter. During the investigation, the chapter\\'s leadership transitioned from long-time Hells Angels member \"Diamond\" Dan Bifield to recent inductee Mark \"Lightning\" Baker after Bifield was voted out as president. Law enforcement began the operation when Bifield made a drug deal with an informant in 2011 and arrested twenty people — sixteen men and four women — in a series of raids in June 2012. The last of the sixteen convicted were sentenced in June 2013; the group was sentenced to more than 100 years imprisonment collectively. Virginia. Four New York metropolitan area Hells Angels members and one prospect were convicted of ambushing and wounding two southern Virginia-based Pagans members at a motel near Greenville on September 10, 2018. The attack happened as the rival gangs happened to be staying at the same motel while passing through the area, and led to one Pagan being shot and the other beaten with a hammer. Dominick J. Eadicicco and club prospect Anthony Milan pleaded guilty to malicious wounding by a mob and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and were sentenced to eight years in prison, while Nathaniel A. Villaman, Joseph Anthony Paturzo and Richard E. West all pleaded guilty to malicious wounding by a mob and were given four year sentences during the trials held in Staunton in January and February 2019. Washington. The Hells Angels founded a Washington state Nomads chapter on 16 July 1994.In 2001 Hells Angels Rodney Lee Rollness, a former Hells Angel, and Joshua Binder murdered Michael \"Santa\" Walsh, who had allegedly falsely claimed to be a member of the Hells Angels. Paul Foster, hoping to join the Hells Angels, aided in the murder by luring Walsh to a party at his house and helping cover up the crime. West Coast leader Richard \"Smilin\\' Rick\" Fabel, along with Rollness and Binder, were also convicted of various racketeering offenses.

      "{'input': ' Radio. Earliest stations: WEAF and WJZ. During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T\\'s manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T\\'s telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The creation of WEAF in 1922 offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of \"chain\" or \"networking\" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T\\'s station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.. New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.. In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company\\'s primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T\\'s phone lines for network transmission. Red and Blue Networks. RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shutting down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division\\'s ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.. WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the \"Red Network\" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the \"Blue Network\" mostly carried sustaining – or non-sponsored – broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.. In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company\\'s decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC\\'s production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures. Chimes. The iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E\\'-C\\', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC\\'s New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E\\'-C\\'-G, known as \"the fourth chime\", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations staffed by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G\\'-E\\'-C\\' notes were not originally intended to reference General Electric (an early shareholder in NBC\\'s founding parent RCA and whose radio station in Schenectady, New York, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network. As an example, it is incorporated into the theme music used by NBC News. In the late 1930s, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached an agreement with NBC for B&O to be allowed to NBC\\'s tones to summon the railroad\\'s passengers to dinner on its trains. New beginnings: The Blue Network becomes ABC. In 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency\\'s creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the commission in 1939 found that NBC\\'s two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.. After Mutual\\'s appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply \"NBC\". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed. Defining radio\\'s golden age. NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini\\'s NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included Vic and Sade, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve, One Man\\'s Family, Ma Perkins and Death Valley Days. NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique clear-channel national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.. In the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation\\'s top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers – including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra – jumped to CBS.. In addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theater on the network became television\\'s first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of simulcasting. Two of the concerts were historic firsts – the first complete telecast of Beethoven\\'s Symphony No. 9, and the first complete telecast of Verdi\\'s Aida (starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.. Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS\\'s Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio\\'s earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, The Big Show\\'s initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell advertising time during the middle half-hour of the program each week).. NBC\\'s last major radio programming push, beginning on June 12, 1955, was Monitor, a creation of NBC President Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver, who also created the innovative programs Today, The Tonight Show and Home for the companion television network. Monitor was a continuous all-weekend mixture of music, news, interviews, and features, with a variety of hosts including well-known television personalities Dave Garroway, Hugh Downs, Ed McMahon, Joe Garagiola, and Gene Rayburn. The potpourri show tried to keep vintage radio alive by featuring segments from Jim and Marian Jordan (in character as Fibber McGee and Molly); Peg Lynch\\'s dialog comedy Ethel and Albert (with Alan Bunce); and iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan. Monitor was a success for a number of years, but after the mid-1960s, local stations, especially those in larger markets, were reluctant to break from their established formats to run non-conforming network programming. One exception was Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend, a weekly series commemorating the great conductor\\'s NBC broadcasts and recordings which ran for several years beginning in 1963. After Monitor ended its 20-year run on January 26, 1975, little remained of NBC network radio beyond hourly newscasts and news features, and Sunday morning religious program The Eternal Light. Decline. On June 18, 1975, NBC launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), which provided up to 55 minutes of news per hour around the clock to local stations that wanted to adopt an all-news radio format. NBC carried the service on WRC in Washington, and on its owned-and-operated FM stations in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. NIS attracted several dozen subscribing stations, but by the fall of 1976, NBC determined that it could not project that the service would ever become profitable and gave its affiliates six months\\' notice that it would be discontinued. NIS ended operations on May 29, 1977. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a modestly successful secondary network providing news and short features to FM rock stations.The NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call-in national talk radio with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal financial advice), Bernard Meltzer (personal and financial advice) and Sally Jessy Raphael (personal and romantic advice). While never much of a ratings success, TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format. For affiliates, many of them struggling AM stations, TalkNet helped fill evening time slots with free programming, allowing the stations to sell local advertising in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming. Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to increasing control of radio content by networks and syndicators. Sale and dissolution. GE reacquired RCA at the end of 1985, then announced their intent to sell off RCA\\'s non-broadcast assets and NBC\\'s radio holdings. After a failed attempt to sell the entire radio unit to Westinghouse Broadcasting, Culver City, California–based syndicator Westwood One (which already owned the Mutual Broadcasting System) bought the NBC Radio Network, The Source, NBC Talknet and NBC Radio Entertainment, along with leases to the radio network\\'s facilities, for $50 million (equivalent to $129 million in 2022). The radio stations were sold off in multiple transactions between 1988 and 1989, including Emmis Communications, Westinghouse and Susquehanna Radio Corporation.By January 1989, Westwood One announced NBC Radio News would move to Mutual\\'s Arlington, Virginia, facility; engineering operations followed along with the affiliate relations department. Further consolidation in 1992 saw Mutual and NBC newscasts jointly produced in overnights and weekends and both networks airing generic sportscasts through the weekend. After Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting in 1994, Infinity purchased 25 percent of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity would then be acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation (now the parent of newly-merged CBS/Westinghouse Broadcasting) for $5 billion in June 1996 (equivalent to $9.33 billion in 2022), with the CBS Radio Network also falling under Westwood One management.The Mutual/NBC newsroom in Arlington closed on August 31, 1998, with CBS Radio News originating \"Mutual\" and \"NBC\" newscasts from New York. These \"NBC\"–branded newscasts produced by CBS were then restricted to morning drive (ET) on weekdays beginning on April 17, 1999, concurrent with Westwood One retiring the Mutual name outright. Remaining NBC affiliates were offered CNN Radio newscasts at all other times.Westwood One would continue to feature \"NBC\"–branded programming, partnering with NBC News to launch NBC News Radio on March 31, 2003, anchored by NBC and MSNBC talent, but limited to one-minute newscasts on weekdays. An audio simulcast of Meet the Press was also distributed by Westwood One starting in 2004 and continues to this day. Following a 2007 buyout, Westwood One was merged into Oaktree Capital Management\\'s Triton Media subsidiary Dial Global in 2011, taking that syndicator\\'s name. Dial Global ended distribution of CNN Radio newscasts and made NBC News Radio a full-time operation in April 2012, with most CNN affiliates switching to NBC. NBC Sports Radio was launched that September as a Dial Global/NBC Sports joint venture. NBC Sports Radio ended 24/7 programming at the end of 2018, and was shut down outright in March 2020.Cumulus Media acquired Dial Global in 2013, which reverted to the Westwood One name and was merged into Cumulus Media Networks. After Cumulus announced a content-sharing deal with CNN as part of the pending launch of white-label news service Westwood One News, NBC News Radio ended operations on December 15, 2014. Since July 2016, iHeartMedia has produced \"NBC News Radio\"–branded newscasts via a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal. Television. For many years, NBC was closely identified with David Sarnoff, who used it as a vehicle to sell consumer electronics. RCA and Sarnoff had captured the spotlight by introducing all-electronic television to the public at the 1939–40 New York World\\'s Fair, simultaneously initiating a regular schedule of programs on the NBC-RCA television station in New York City. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared at the fair before the NBC camera, becoming the first U.S. president to appear on television on April 30, 1939 (an actual, off-the-monitor photograph of the FDR telecast is available at the David Sarnoff Library). The broadcast was transmitted by NBC\\'s New York television station W2XBS Channel 1 (later WNBC-TV; now WNBC, channel 4) and was seen by about 1,000 viewers within the station\\'s roughly 40-mile (64 km) coverage area from its transmitter at the Empire State Building.. The following day (May 1), four models of RCA television sets went on sale to the general public in various department stores around New York City, which were promoted in a series of splashy newspaper ads. DuMont Laboratories (and others) had actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC\\'s announced April 1939 television launch. Later in 1939, NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area, establishing many \"firsts\" in television broadcasting.. Reportedly, the first NBC Television \"network\" program was broadcast on January 12, 1940, when a play titled Meet The Wife was originated at the W2XBS studios at Rockefeller Center and rebroadcast by W2XB/W2XAF (now WRGB) in Schenectady, which received the New York station directly off-air from a tower atop a mountain and relayed the live signal to the Capital District. About this time, occasional special events were also broadcast in Philadelphia (over W3XE, later called WPTZ, now known as KYW-TV) as well as Schenectady. The most ambitious NBC television \"network\" program of the pre-war era was the telecast of the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1940, which was fed live to the New York City and Schenectady stations. However, despite major promotion by RCA, television sales in New York from 1939 to 1942 were disappointing, primarily due to the high cost of the sets, and the lack of compelling regularly scheduled programming. During this period, only a few thousand television sets were sold in the New York area, most of which were sold to bars, hotels and other public places, where the general public viewed special sports and news events. One special event was Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s second and final appearance on live television, when his speech at Madison Square Garden on October 28, 1940, was telecast over W2XBS to receivers in the New York City area.. Television\\'s experimental period ended, as the FCC allowed full-fledged commercial television broadcasts to begin on July 1, 1941. NBC station W2XBS in New York City received the first commercial license, adopting the call letters WNBT. The first official, paid television advertisement broadcast by any U.S. station was for watch manufacturer Bulova, which aired that day, just before the start of a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball telecast on WNBT. The ad consisted of test pattern, featuring the newly assigned WNBT call letters, which was modified to resemble a clock – complete with functioning hands – with the Bulova logo (featuring the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\") in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern (a photograph of the NBC camera setting up the test pattern-advertisement for that ad can be seen at this page). Among the programs that aired during the first week of WNBT\\'s new, commercial schedule was The Sunoco News, a simulcast of the Sun Oil-sponsored NBC Radio program anchored by Lowell Thomas; amateur boxing at Jamaica Arena; the Eastern Clay Courts tennis championships; programming from the USO; the spelling bee-type game show Words on the Wing; a few feature films; and a one-time-only, test broadcast of the game show Truth or Consequences, sponsored by Lever Brothers.Prior to the first commercial television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC\\'s earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939, over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers\\' regular radio sponsors at the time to have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant\\'s cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed in the early years of the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network\\'s first regularly scheduled program. Also in 1944, \"The War As It Happens\" came to television on a weekly basis.. \"The War As It Happens\" began as a local program, but NBC records indicate that in April 1944, it was fed to Schenectady and Philadelphia on the fledgling NBC Television Network and became the first news cast regularly seen in multiple cities. On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast several hours of news coverage and remotes from around New York City. This event was promoted in advance by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York area. At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Hotel Astor panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television\\'s rapid growth after the war ended.. The NBC television network grew from its initial post-war line-up of four stations. The 1947 World Series featured two New York City area teams (the Yankees and the Dodgers), and television sales boomed locally, since the games were being telecast in the New York market. Additional stations along the East Coast and in the Midwest were connected by coaxial cable through the late 1940s, and in September 1951 the first transcontinental telecasts took place.. The post-war 1940s and early 1950s brought success for NBC in the new medium. Television\\'s first major star, Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theatre began in June 1948, drew the first large audiences to NBC Television. Under its innovative president, Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver, the network launched Today and The Tonight Show, which would bookend the broadcast day for over 50 years, and which still lead their competitors. Weaver, who also launched the genre of periodic 90-minute network \"spectaculars\", network-produced motion pictures and the live 90-minute Sunday afternoon series Wide Wide World, left the network in 1955 in a dispute with its chairman David Sarnoff, who subsequently named his son Robert Sarnoff as president.. In 1951, NBC commissioned Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera ever written for television; Menotti came up with Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year. Color television. While rival CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the United States, their system was incompatible with the millions of black and white sets in use at the time. After a series of limited, incompatible color broadcasts (mostly scheduled during the day), CBS abandoned the system and broadcasts. This opened the door for the RCA-compatible color system to be adopted as the U.S. standard. RCA convinced the FCC to approve its color system in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming within days of the commission\\'s decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, The Marriage.. In 1955, NBC broadcast a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie\\'s beloved play, on the Producers\\' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical\\'s entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers\\' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.. In 1956, NBC started a subsidiary, California National Productions (CNP), for merchandising, syndication and NBC opera company operations with the production of Silent Services. By 1957, NBC planned to remove the opera company from CNP and CNP was in discussion with MGM Television about handling syndication distribution for MGM series.During a National Association of Broadcasters meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program The Bell Telephone Hour, which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.. In 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color. Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as Walt Disney Presents) on ABC; however, ABC president Leonard Goldenson said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Color). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC\\'s telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.. By 1963, much of NBC\\'s prime time schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of I Dream of Jeannie and Convoy), and began billing itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the 1966–67 season. Days of Our Lives became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.. NBC contracted with Universal Studios in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, See How They Run, which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, The Hanged Man, aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.In 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM\\'s increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film\\'s showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.. The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS, and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC\\'s case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society. 1970s doldrums. The 1970s started strongly for NBC thanks to hits like Adam-12, Rowan & Martin\\'s Laugh-In, Ironside, The Dean Martin Show, and The Flip Wilson Show. However, despite the success of such new shows as the NBC Mystery Movie, Sanford and Son, Chico and the Man, Little House on the Prairie, The Midnight Special, The Rockford Files, Police Woman, and Emergency!, as well as continued success from veterans like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Wonderful World of Disney, the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade. Disney, in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put 60 Minutes up against the program in the Sunday 7:00 p.m. time slot in the 1975–76 season.. In 1974, under new president Herbert Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, miniseries and specials. This failed to attract the desirable 18–34 demographic, and simultaneously alienated older viewers. None of the new prime-time shows that NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal, all failing in the face of established competition. The network\\'s lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show, NBC\\'s Saturday Night – which would be renamed Saturday Night Live in 1976, after the cancellation of a Howard Cosell-hosted program of the same title on ABC – which replaced reruns of The Tonight Show that previously aired in its Saturday time slot.. In 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice president at RCA, and a desperate NBC lured Fred Silverman away from top-rated ABC to turn its fortunes around. With the notable exceptions of CHiPs, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Diff\\'rent Strokes (and its spin-off The Facts of Life), Real People, and the miniseries Shōgun, Silverman was unable to pull out a hit. Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch (such as Hello, Larry, Supertrain, Pink Lady and Jeff, The Krofft Superstar Hour, season six of Saturday Night Live, and The Waverly Wonders). Many of them were beaten in the ratings by shows that Silverman had greenlit during his previous tenures at CBS and ABC.. During this time, several longtime affiliates also defected from NBC in markets such as Atlanta (WSB-TV), Bakersfield (KERO-TV), Baltimore (WBAL-TV), Baton Rouge (WBRZ-TV), Billings (KTVQ), Brownsville (KRGV-TV), Charlotte (WSOC-TV), Columbia, Missouri (KOMU-TV), Dayton (WDTN), Decatur (WAAY-TV), El Dorado (KLAA), Eugene (KVAL-TV), Fargo (WDAY-TV), Fort Smith (KFSM-TV), Green Bay (WFRV-TV), Indianapolis (WRTV), Jacksonville (WTLV), Knoxville (WATE-TV), Marquette (WJMN-TV), Minneapolis-St. Paul (KSTP-TV), Medford (KTVL), Odessa (KMID), Panama City (WMBB), Rapid City (KOTA-TV), San Diego (KGTV), Savannah (WSAV-TV), Schenectady (WRGB), Sioux Falls (KSFY-TV), Temple (KCEN-TV), Tyler (KLTV), Waterbury (WATR-TV) and Wheeling (WTRF-TV). Most of these stations were wooed away by ABC, which had lifted out of last place to become the #1 network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, while WBAL-TV, KERO-TV, KFSM-TV, KTVQ KVAL-TV, KTVL, WRGB and WTRF-TV went to CBS and WATR-TV became an independent station under the new WTXX calls (it is now CW affiliate WCCT-TV); ABC had originally considered aligning with WBAL, but the station decided against it because ABC\\'s evening newscasts had attracted ratings too dismal for them to consider doing so. Most of these defected from NBC were VHF stations, with some exceptions including WAAY-TV, WATR-TV, KLAA-TV and KERO, which are UHF stations (in case of both Huntsville and Bakersfield, it was since these cities lacked any sort of VHF stations). In the case of WSB-TV and WSOC-TV, which have both since become ABC affiliates, both stations were (and remain) under common ownership with Cox Media Group, with its other NBC affiliate at the time, WIIC-TV in Pittsburgh (which would become WPXI in 1981 and also remains owned by Cox), only staying with the network because WIIC-TV itself was a distant third to CBS-affiliated powerhouse KDKA-TV and ABC affiliate WTAE-TV and wouldn\\'t be on par with those stations until the 1990s (KDKA-TV, owned at the time by Group W and now owned by CBS, infamously passed up affiliating with NBC after Westinghouse bought the station from DuMont in 1954, leading to an acrimonious relationship between NBC and Westinghouse that lasted for years afterward). In markets such as San Diego, Fort Smith, Charlotte, Knoxville and Jacksonville, NBC had little choice but to affiliate with a UHF station, with the San Diego station (KNSD) eventually becoming an NBC O&O, though in the case of Knoxville, it moved back to VHF in 1988 with the switch to then-CBS affiliate WBIR-TV. In Wheeling, NBC ultimately upgraded its affiliation when it partnered with WTOV-TV in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, overtaking former affiliate WTRF-TV in the ratings by a large margin. Other smaller television markets like Yuma, Arizona waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate (first with KIVA, and later KYMA). The stations in Baltimore, Columbia, Dayton, Jacksonville, Savannah, and Temple, however, have since rejoined the network, although El Dorado went to a full-time Fox affiliate after a long association with ABC, Green Bay switched to CBS several years after being associated with ABC, and Bakersfield, where it went to ABC several years after it was a CBS affiliate. In case of Rapid City, the KOTA calls now resist on a station owned by Gray Television.After President Jimmy Carter pulled the U.S. team out of the 1980 Summer Olympics, NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network\\'s future in doubt. It had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.The press was merciless towards Silverman, but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC\\'s \"Proud as a Peacock\" image campaign created a parody song called \"Loud as a Peacock\", which was broadcast on Don Imus\\' program on WNBC radio in New York. Its lyrics blamed Silverman for the network\\'s problems (\"The Peacock\\'s dead, so thank you, Fred\"). An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, though technology eventually allowed its wide propagation to the Internet in later generations from a few remaining copies. Saturday Night Live writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled \"A Limo For A Lame-O\", where he presented a chart with the top-10 rated programs for that season and commented that there was \"not one N\" on the list. Silverman later admitted he \"never liked Al Franken to begin with\", and the sketch ruined Franken\\'s chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of SNL following his 1980 departure (with the position going to Jean Doumanian, who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985). Tartikoff\\'s turnaround. Fred Silverman eventually resigned as entertainment president in the summer of 1981. Grant Tinker, a highly regarded producer who co-founded MTM Enterprises with his former wife Mary Tyler Moore, became the president of the network while Brandon Tartikoff became the president of the entertainment division. Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms, but showed patience with promising programs. One such show was the critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues, which suffered from poor ratings during its first season. Rather than canceling the show, he moved the Emmy Award-winning police drama from Steven Bochco to Thursdays, where its ratings improved dramatically. He used the same tactics with St. Elsewhere and Cheers. Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher-rated competition because of their desirable demographics, upscale adults ages 18–34. While the network claimed moderate successes with Gimme a Break!, Silver Spoons, Knight Rider, and Remington Steele, its biggest hit during this period was The A-Team, which, at 10th place, was the network\\'s only program to rank in the Nielsen Top-20 for the 1982–83 season, and ascended to fourth place the following year. These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983–84 season, which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.In February 1982, NBC canceled Tom Snyder\\'s The Tomorrow Show and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian David Letterman. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his weekday morning talk show effort for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), Late Night with David Letterman proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise that continues to this day.. In 1984, the huge success of The Cosby Show led to a renewed interest in sitcoms, while Family Ties and Cheers, both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings (the latter ranking at near dead last among all network shows during the 1982–83 season), saw their viewership increase from having Cosby as a lead-in. The network rose from third place to second in the ratings during the 1984–85 season and reached first place in 1985–86, with hits The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, 227, Night Court, Highway to Heaven, and Hunter. The network\\'s upswing continued late into the decade with ALF, Amen, Matlock, L.A. Law, The Hogan Family, A Different World, Empty Nest, Unsolved Mysteries, and In the Heat of the Night. In 1986, Bob Wright was appointed as chairman of NBC.. In 1985, NBC became the first American television network to broadcast programs in stereo. NBC started repairing its old affiliations that were previously wooed by ABC, such as Savannah, Temple and Columbia, followed by Jacksonville in 1988. It also repaired WOWT, a station formerly affiliated with CBS, in 1986.In the fall of 1987, NBC conceived a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations, under the brand \"Prime Time Begins at 7:30\", consisting of five sitcoms that each aired once a week, and were produced by various production companies contracted by NBC. The series included Marblehead Manor (from Paramount Television, airing Mondays), centering on a mansion owner and the people who live with him; She\\'s the Sheriff (from Lorimar-Telepictures and airing Tuesdays), a comeback vehicle for Suzanne Somers which cast her as a widowed county sheriff; a series adapted from the George S. Kaufman play You Can\\'t Take It with You (airing Wednesdays), starring Harry Morgan; Out of This World (from MCA Television and airing Thursdays), which starred Maureen Flannigan as a teenager born to an alien father and human mother that develops supernatural abilities on her 13th birthday; and a revival of the short-lived 1983 NBC series We Got It Made (produced by Fred Silverman for MGM Television and closing out the week on Fridays), as part of an ongoing trend at the time in which former network series were revived in first-run syndication. The sitcom checkerboard concept was first tested on station KCRA in Sacramento early in 1986, and consists of five different shows in the checkerboard pattern, such as The New Gidget, One Big Family, Mama\\'s Family, Throb and It\\'s a Living (two of these, as Mama\\'s Family and It\\'s a Living are syndicated revivals of the network sitcoms that were axed early in the decade).The package was aimed at attracting viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, 7:00 p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived as a result of the FCC\\'s loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30 p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can\\'t Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She\\'s the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.. That year, in 1987, NBC is planning on to increase output of in-house productions for next year, such as a series of half-hour dramedies, and made an experimental sitcom lineup for Thanksgiving weekend (November 29) that would consist of four sitcoms on the lineup, which consists of Night Court, Beverly Hills Buntz, Family Ties and My Two Dads, and the low ratings for NBC\\'s daytime lineup caused by the creation of the new soap opera that was set for spring 1988, Generations. At the same time, NBC confirms its plans to integrate its NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications, with Enterprises merchandising and foreign sales becoming part of NBC-TV and guest relations and studio tours were added to the Corporate Communications branch, and a new operation service, NBC Operations & Services was created.NBC aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. The 1988–89 season saw NBC have an astounding 17 series in Nielsen\\'s year-end Top 30 most-watched network programs; it also ranked at first place in the weekly ratings for more than 12 months, an unprecedented achievement that has not been duplicated since. 1989 however, also served as NBC\\'s final year of covering Major League Baseball (the primary package would move over to CBS for the next four years before NBC regained the rights), having done so in some shape or form since 1947. Nevertheless, the network continued its hot streak into the early 1990s with new hits such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Blossom, and Law & Order. \"Must See TV\". In 1991, Tartikoff left his role as NBC\\'s President of Entertainment to take an executive position at Paramount Pictures. In the course of a decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. Some blamed Littlefield for losing David Letterman to CBS after naming Jay Leno as the successor to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, following the latter\\'s retirement as host in May 1992. Things turned around with the launches of new hit series such as Mad About You, Wings, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER and Will & Grace.. One of Tartikoff\\'s late acquisitions, Seinfeld initially struggled from its debut in 1989 as a summer series, but grew to become one of NBC\\'s top-rated shows after it was moved to Thursdays in the time slot following Cheers. Seinfeld ended its run in 1998, becoming the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings for a single television season. Only two other shows had finished their runs at the top of the ratings, I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show. Consequently, Friends emerged as NBC\\'s biggest television show after the 1998 Seinfeld final broadcast. It dominated the ratings, never leaving the top five watched shows of the year from its second through tenth seasons and landing on the number-one spot during season eight in the 2001–02 season as the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings. Cheers spinoff Frasier became a critical and commercial success, usually landing in the Nielsen Top 20 – although its ratings were overshadowed to a minor extent by Friends – and went on to win numerous Emmy Awards (eventually setting a record for a sitcom that lasted until it was overtaken by Modern Family in 2014). In 1994, the network began branding its strong Thursday night lineup, mainly in reference to the comedies airing in the first two hours, under the \"Must See TV\" tagline (which during the mid- and late 1990s, was also applied to NBC\\'s comedy blocks on other nights, particularly on Tuesdays).. Between September 1994 and September 1996, NBC would affiliate with several stations that were affected by the 1994–96 United States broadcast TV realignment, which was triggered as a result of Fox\\'s acquisition of rights to the NFL in December 1993. Several of those stations, including WBAL-TV, WHDH (Boston), and WCAU (Philadelphia), were involved in an affiliation deal between Westinghouse Broadcasting and CBS, KSHB-TV (Kansas City), which is one of the stations involved in an affiliation deal between New World Communications and Fox, WCBD-TV (Charleston), which was involved in an affiliation deal between Allbritton Communications and ABC  and WGBA-TV (Green Bay), WPMI-TV (Mobile) and KHNL (Honolulu), which was part of an agreement between Fox and SF Broadcasting.By the mid-1990s, NBC\\'s sports division, headed by Dick Ebersol, had rights to three of the four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, Major League Baseball and the NBA), the Olympics, and the national powerhouse Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. The NBA on NBC enjoyed great success in the 1990s due in large part to the Chicago Bulls\\' run of six championships at the hands of superstar Michael Jordan. However, NBC Sports would suffer a major blow in 1998, when it lost the rights to the American Football Conference (AFC) to CBS, which itself had lost rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) to Fox four years earlier; the deal stripped NBC of National Football League (NFL) game telecasts after 59 years and AFC games after 36 years (dating back to its existence as the American Football League prior to its 1970 merger with the NFL).. Littlefield left NBC in 1998 to pursue a career as a television and film producer, with the network subsequently going through three entertainment presidents in three years. Littlefield was replaced as president of NBC Entertainment by Scott Sassa, who oversaw the development of such shows as The West Wing, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Fear Factor. After Sassa was reassigned to NBC\\'s West Coast Division, Garth Ancier was named as his replacement in 1999. Jeff Zucker then succeeded Ancier as president of NBC Entertainment in 2000. New century, new problems. At the start of the 2000s, NBC\\'s fortunes started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC\\'s longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC\\'s nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and Just Shoot Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Between the 2001–02 and 2004–05 seasons, NBC became the first major network to air select dramas in letterbox over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost. Overall, NBC retook its first-place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.. On the other hand, NBC was stripped of the broadcast rights to two other major sports leagues: it lost Major League Baseball to Fox after the 2000 season (by that point, NBC only had alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and World Series), and, later, the NBA to ABC after the 2001–02 season. After losing the NBA rights, NBC\\'s major sports offerings were reduced to the Olympics (which in 2002, expanded to include rights to the Winter Olympics, as part of a contract that gave it the U.S. television rights to both the Summer and Winter Olympics through 2012), PGA Tour golf events and a floundering Notre Dame football program (however, it would eventually acquire the rights to the National Hockey League in May 2004).. In October 2001, NBC acquired Spanish-language network Telemundo from Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment for $2.7 billion, beating out other bidders including CBS/Viacom. The deal was finalized in 2002.In 2003, French entertainment conglomerate Vivendi Universal sold 80% of its film and television subsidiary, Vivendi Universal Entertainment, to NBC\\'s parent company, General Electric, integrating the network with Vivendi Universal\\'s various properties (Universal Pictures film studio, Canal+ television networks, & Universal Parks & Resorts theme & amusement parks & resorts) upon completion of the merger of the two companies under the combined NBC Universal brand. NBC Universal was then owned 80% by General Electric and 20% by Vivendi. In 2004, Zucker was promoted to the newly created position of president of NBC Universal Television Group. Kevin Reilly became the new president of NBC Entertainment.In 2004, NBC experienced a three on a match scenario—Friends and Frasier ended their runs; Jerry Orbach, who had played Lennie Briscoe in its hit Law & Order, died suddenly later that year)—and shortly afterward was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits. In particular, Friends spin-off Joey, despite a relatively strong start, started to falter in the ratings during its second season.. In December 2005, NBC began its first week-long primetime game show event, Deal or No Deal; the series garnered high ratings, and became a weekly series in March 2006. Otherwise, the 2005–06 season was one of the worst for NBC in three decades, with only one fall series, the sitcom My Name Is Earl, surviving for a second season; the sole remaining anchor of the \"Must See TV\" lineup, Will & Grace also saw its ratings decline. That season, NBC\\'s ratings fell to fourth place, behind a resurgent ABC, Fox (which would eventually become the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the 2007–08 season), and top-rated CBS (which led for much of the remainder of the decade). During this time, all of the networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by cable television, home video, video games, and the Internet, with NBC being the hardest hit.. The 2006–07 season was a mixed bag for the network, with Deal or No Deal remaining strong and Heroes becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (from West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin) lost a third of its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually canceled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, The Office and 30 Rock, also pulled in modest successes and went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years. The network also regained the rights to the NFL after eight years that season when it acquired the Sunday Night Football package from ESPN (as part of a deal that also saw Monday Night Football move to ESPN from ABC). However, despite this, NBC remained at a very distant fourth place, barely ranking ahead of The CW.. However, NBC did experience success with its summer schedule, despite its declining ratings during the main broadcast season. America\\'s Got Talent, a reality talent competition series that premiered in 2006, earned a 4.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, higher than that earned by the 2002 premiere of Fox\\'s American Idol. Got Talent (which is the flagship of an international talent competition franchise) would continue to garner unusually high ratings throughout its summer run. However, NBC decided not to place it in the spring season, and instead use it as a platform to promote their upcoming fall shows.Following the unexpected termination of Kevin Reilly, in 2007, Ben Silverman was appointed president of NBC Entertainment, while Jeff Zucker was promoted to succeed Bob Wright as CEO of NBC. The network failed to generate any new primetime hits during the 2008–09 season (despite the rare good fortune of having the rights to both the Super Bowl and the Summer Olympics in which to promote their new programming slate), the sitcom Parks and Recreation survived for a second season after a six-episode first season, while Heroes and Deal or No Deal both collapsed in the ratings and were later canceled (with a revamped Deal or No Deal being revived for one additional season in syndication). In a March 2009 interview, Zucker had stated that he no longer believed it would be possible for NBC to become #1 in prime time. Ben Silverman left the network in 2009, with Jeff Gaspin replacing him as president of NBC Entertainment. Comcast era (2011–present). On December 3, 2009, Comcast announced they would purchase a 51% controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric (which would retain the remaining 49%) for $6.5 billion in cash and $9.1 billion in raised debt. GE used $5.8 billion from the deal to buy out Vivendi\\'s 20% interest in NBC Universal.NBC\\'s broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, in February of that year, generated a ratings increase of 21% over its broadcast of the 2006 Winter Games in Torino. The network was criticized for repeatedly showing footage of a crash occurring during practice for an Olympic luge competition that killed Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. NBC News president Steve Capus ordered the footage not to be shown without his permission and Olympics prime time host Bob Costas promised on-air that the video would not be shown again during the Games. NBC Universal was on track to lose $250 million in advertising revenue on that year\\'s Winter Olympics, failing to make up the $820 million it paid for the U.S. television rights. Even so, with its continuing position in fourth place (although it virtually tied with ABC in many demographics on the strength of NBC\\'s sports broadcasts that year), the 2009–10 season ended with only two scripted shows – Community and Parenthood, as well as three unscripted shows – The Marriage Ref, Who Do You Think You Are? and Minute to Win It – being renewed for second seasons, while other series such as Heroes and veteran crime drama Law & Order (the latter of which ended after 20 seasons, tying it with Gunsmoke as the longest-running prime time drama in U.S. television history) were cancelled. After Conan O\\'Brien succeeded Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009, the network gave Leno a new prime time talk show, committing to air it every weeknight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific as an inexpensive comedic alternative to the police procedurals and other hour-long dramas typically aired in that time slot. In doing so, NBC became the first major U.S. broadcast network in decades, if ever, to broadcast the same program in a week daily prime time strip. Its executives called the decision \"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\" and \"in effect, launching five shows.\" Conversely, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas in the 10:00 hour, and expressed concern that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted series. Citing complaints from many affiliates, which saw their late-evening newscasts drop significantly in the local ratings during The Jay Leno Show\\'s run, NBC announced on January 10, 2010, that it would drop Leno\\'s show from the 10:00 p.m. slot, with Zucker announcing plans to shift the program (which would have been reduced to a half-hour) into the 11:35 p.m. slot and shift its existing late night lineup (including The Tonight Show) by 30 minutes. The removal of The Jay Leno Show from its prime time schedule had almost no impact on the network\\'s ratings. The increases NBC experienced in the 2010–11 season compared to 2009–10 were almost entirely attributable to the rising viewership of NBC Sunday Night Football. By 2012, the shows that occupied the 10:00 p.m. time slot drew lower numbers than The Jay Leno Show did when it aired in that hour two years before. In the spring of 2010, cable provider and multimedia firm Comcast announced it would acquire a majority interest in NBC Universal from General Electric, which would retain a minority stake in the company in the interim.. On September 24, 2010, Jeff Zucker announced that he would step down as NBC Universal\\'s CEO once the company\\'s merger with Comcast was completed at the end of the year. After the deal was finalized, Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment. In 2011, NBC was finally able to find a breakout hit in the midseason reality singing competition series The Voice. Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with every single new fall program getting cancelled by season\\'s end – the third time this has happened to the network after the fall of 1975, and the fall of 1983 – and the midseason legal drama Harry\\'s Law being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the 2011–12 season. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning time slot leased by the Qubo consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when Last Call with Carson Daly converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.. The 2011–12 season was another tough season for NBC. On the upside, the network\\'s broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI was the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time, and the network\\'s Monday night midseason lineup of The Voice and musical-drama Smash was very successful. The network managed to lift itself into third place in the 18–49 demographic in the 2011–12 season, primarily on the strength of those three programs (SNF, The Voice, and Smash), breaking the network\\'s eight-year streak in fourth place. Four shows survived for a second season, but three of them were cancelled in the following year, none were unqualified ratings successes, and the network remained a distant fourth place in total viewership.. In the fall of 2012, NBC greatly expanded its sitcom roster, with eight comedy series airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. NBC bounced back to first place network in adults 18–49 that fall, boosted by the new season of The Voice, the initial success of freshman drama Revolution and sitcom Go On, and the continued strength of Sunday Night Football. However, withholding the new season of The Voice and benching Revolution until late March, the network\\'s midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network Univision during the February sweeps period. The 2012–13 season ended with NBC finishing in third place overall, albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (Revolution, Chicago Fire and Hannibal).. In 2013, NBC Sports migrated its business and production operations (including NBCSN) to new facilities in Stamford, Connecticut. Production of the network\\'s NFL pre-game show Football Night in America remained at the NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center (with production operations based in Studio 8G, while the program itself was broadcast in Studio 8H, the longtime home of Saturday Night Live), until it migrated to the Stamford facility in September 2014. Despite the failure of another highly advertised game show event, The Million Second Quiz, the 2013–14 season was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football and Grimm. Along with new hits including The Blacklist, Hannibal and Chicago PD and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC became the No. 1 network in the coveted 18–49 demographic that season for the first time since 2003–04, when Friends ended. NBC also improved considerably in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season.The 2014–15 season was something of a mixed bag for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18–49 demographic and in second place overall.The 2015–16 season was successful for NBC, with the successful launch of the new drama Blindspot premiering after The Voice, then subsequently being renewed for a second season in November 2015. NBC also continued with the success with the Chicago franchise with launching its second spin-off Chicago Med, which also received an early second season pick up in February 2016. Thursday nights continues to be a struggle for NBC, with continued success with the third season of The Blacklist brought the failed launch of Heroes Reborn which was cancelled in January 2016, and thriller The Player; however, NBC found success with police procedural Shades of Blue, which improved in its timeslot and was renewed for a second season in February 2016. On the comedy side, NBC surprisingly found success in the new workplace sitcom Superstore which premiered as a \"preview\" after The Voice in November 2015, and officially launched in January 2016 which brought decent ratings for a new comedy without The Voice as a lead-in and which was subsequently renewed for a second season in February 2016.. The 2016–17 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of comedy-drama This Is Us, which was well received by critics and ratings and was renewed for two additional seasons in January 2017. The Blacklist continued to bring in modest ratings, but it brought the failed launch of its spinoff The Blacklist: Redemption. NBC continued to grow the Chicago franchise with a third spinoff titled Chicago Justice. On the comedy side, workplace sitcom Superstore continued success in its second season. The network launched new fantasy sitcom The Good Place following The Voice and brought in modest ratings and was renewed for a second season in January 2017. Another highlight of the 2016–17 season was The Wall, which premiered to modest ratings and would air in the summer time period prior to the 2017–18 season.. The 2017–18 season brought continued success for NBC with the premiere of Ellen\\'s Game of Games and the return of Will & Grace, the latter of which previously aired its final episode in 2006. The 2018–19 season would continue the network\\'s success with the premieres of The Titan Games, Manifest, Songland, and New Amsterdam, all of which would be renewed for additional seasons; however, The Village and The Enemy Within would not make it past their first seasons. The network\\'s dominance of the 2010s would fade during the 2019–20 season, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption in production of the network\\'s programming. The pandemic caused the IOC and the Japanese government to reach an agreement to postpone the 2020 Summer Olympics to the summer of 2021, resulting in the network having to rely on alternative programming for the summer of 2020. The network later moved to #2 in the Nielsen ratings (behind only CBS) in 2021, then reclaimed its status the top-rated network in 2022.  Further reading. Hilmes, Michele (2007).

      "{'input': ' Optics. Light (from the Latin lux, lucis) is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 750 nm, the part of the visible spectrum that is perceived by the human eye, located between infrared and ultraviolet radiation. It consists of massless elementary particles called photons, which move at a speed of 299 792 458 m/s in a vacuum, while in matter it depends on its refractive index . .   .     .

The branch of physics that studies the behavior and characteristics of light is optics. Light is the physical agent that makes objects visible to the human eye. Its origin can be in celestial bodies such as the sun, the moon, or the stars, natural phenomena such as lightning, or in materials in combustion, ignition, or incandescence. Throughout history, human beings have devised different procedures to obtain light in spaces lacking it, such as torches, candles, candlesticks, lamps or, more recently, electric lighting. Light is both the agent that enables vision and a visible phenomenon in itself, since light is also an object perceptible by the human eye. Light enables the perception of color, which reaches the retina through light rays that are transmitted by the retina to the optic nerve, which in turn transmits them to the brain by means of nerve impulses. The perception of light is a psychological process and each person perceives the same physical object and the same luminosity in a different way.Physical objects have different levels of luminance (or reflectance), that is, they absorb or reflect to a greater or lesser extent the light that strikes them, which affects the color, from white (maximum reflection) to black (maximum absorption). Both black and white are not considered colors of the conventional chromatic circle, but gradations of brightness and darkness, whose transitions make up the shadows. When white light hits a surface of a certain color, photons of that color are reflected; if these photons subsequently hit another surface they will illuminate it with the same color, an effect known as radiance  — generally perceptible only with intense light. If that object is in turn the same color, it will reinforce its level of colored luminosity, i.e. its saturation.White light from the sun consists of a continuous spectrum of colors which, when divided, forms the colors of the rainbow: violet, indigo blue, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. In its interaction with the Earth\\'s atmosphere, sunlight tends to scatter the shorter wavelengths, i.e. the blue photons, which is why the sky is perceived as blue. On the other hand, at sunset, when the atmosphere is denser, the light is less scattered, so that the longer wavelengths, red, are perceived.Color is a specific wavelength of white light. The colors of the chromatic spectrum have different shades or tones, which are usually represented in the chromatic circle, where the primary colors and their derivatives are located. There are three primary colors: lemon yellow, magenta red, and cyan blue. If they are mixed, the three secondary colors are obtained: orange red, bluish violet, and green. If a primary and a secondary are mixed, the tertiary colors are obtained: greenish blue, orange yellow, etc. On the other hand, complementary colors are two colors that are on opposite sides of the chromatic circle (green and magenta, yellow and violet, blue and orange) and adjacent colors are those that are close within the circle (yellow and green, red and orange). If a color is mixed with an adjacent color, it is shaded, and if it is mixed with a complementary color, it is neutralized (darkened). Three factors are involved in the definition of color: hue, the position within the chromatic circle; saturation, the purity of the color, which is involved in its brightness — the maximum saturation is that of a color that has no mixture with black or its complementary; and value, the level of luminosity of a color, increasing when mixed with white and decreasing when mixed with black or a complementary.. The main source of light is the sun and its perception can vary according to the time of day: the most normal is mid-morning or mid-afternoon light, generally blue, clear and diaphanous, although it depends on atmospheric dispersion and cloudiness and other climatic factors; midday light is whiter and more intense, with high contrast and darker shadows; dusk light is more yellowish, soft and warm; sunset light is orange or red, low contrast, with intense bluish shadows; evening light is a darker red, dimmer light, with weaker shadows and contrast (the moment known as alpenglow, which occurs in the eastern sky on clear days, gives pinkish tones); the light of cloudy skies depends on the time of day and the degree of cloudiness, is a dim and diffuse light with soft shadows, low contrast and high saturation (in natural environments there can be a mixture of light and shadow known as \"mottled light\"); finally, night light can be lunar or some atmospheric refraction of sunlight, is diffuse and dim (in contemporary times there is also light pollution from cities). We must also point out the natural light that filters indoors, a diffuse light of lower intensity, with a variable contrast depending on whether it has a single origin or several (for example, several windows), as well as a coloring also variable, depending on the time of day, the weather or the surface on which it is reflected. An outstanding interior light is the so-called \"north light\", which is the light that enters through a north-facing window, which does not come directly from the sun -always located to the south- and is therefore a soft and diffuse, constant and homogeneous light, much appreciated by artists in times when there was no adequate artificial lighting.. As for artificial light, the main ones are: fire and candles, red or orange; electric, yellow or orange — generally tungsten or wolfram — it can be direct (focal) or diffused by lamp shades; fluorescent, greenish; and photographic, white (flash light). Logically, in many environments there can be mixed light, a combination of natural and artificial light.The visible reality is made up of a play of light and shadow: the shadow is formed when an opaque body obstructs the path of the light. In general, there is a ratio between light and shadow whose gradation depends on various factors, from lighting to the presence and placement of various objects that can generate shadows; however, there are conditions in which one of the two factors can reach the extreme, as in the case of snow or fog or, conversely, at night. We speak of high key lighting when white or light tones predominate, or low key lighting if black or dark tones predominate.Shadows can be of shape (also called \"self shadows\") or of projection (\"cast shadows\"): the former are the shaded areas of a physical object, that is, the part of that object on which light does not fall; the latter are the shadows cast by these objects on some surface, usually the ground. Self shadows define the volume and texture of an object; cast shadows help define space. The lightest part of the shadow is the \"umbra\" and the darkest part is the \"penumbra\". The shape and appearance of the shadow depends on the size and distance of the light source: the most pronounced shadows are from small or distant sources, while a large or close source will give more diffuse shadows. In the first case, the shadow will have sharp edges and the darker area (penumbra) will occupy most of it; in the second, the edge will be more diffuse and the umbra will predominate. A shadow can receive illumination from a secondary source, known as \"fill light\". The color of a shadow is between blue and black, and also depends on several factors, such as light contrast, transparency and translucency. The projection of shadows is different if they come from natural or artificial light: with natural light the beams are parallel and the shadow adapts both to the terrain and to the various obstacles that may intervene; with artificial light the beams are divergent, with less defined limits, and if there are several light sources, combined shadows may be produced.The reflection of light produces four derived phenomena: glints, which are reflections of the light source, be it the sun, artificial lights or incidental sources such as doors and windows; glares, which are reflections produced by illuminated bodies as a reflective screen, especially white surfaces; color reflections, produced by the proximity between various objects, especially if they are luminous; and image reflections, produced by polished surfaces, such as mirrors or water. Another phenomenon produced by light is transparency, which occurs in bodies that are not opaque, with a greater or lesser degree depending on the opacity of the object, from total transparency to varying degrees of translucency. Transparency generates filtered light, a type of luminosity that can also be produced through curtains, blinds, awnings, various fabrics, pergolas and arbors, or through the foliage of trees. Pictorial representation of light. The attraction that light exerts on the artist goes beyond its practical function as an element that defines volumes and spaces. Light is also an element that carries in itself a very special magic and attraction.. In artistic terminology, \"light\" is the point or center of light diffusion in the composition of a painting, or the luminous part of a painting in relation to the shadows. This term is also used to describe the way a painting is illuminated: zenithal or plumb light (vertical rays), high light (oblique rays), straight light (horizontal rays), workshop or studio light (artificial light), etc. The term \"accidental light\" is also used to refer to light not produced by the sun, which can be either moonlight or artificial light from candles, torches, etc. The light can come from different directions, which according to its incidence can be differentiated between: \"lateral\", when it comes from the side, it is a light that highlights more the texture of the objects; \"frontal\", when it comes from the front, it eliminates the shadows and the sensation of volume; \"zenithal\", a vertical light of higher origin than the object, it produces a certain deformation of the figure; \"contrapicado\", vertical light of lower origin, it deforms the figure in an exaggerated way; and \"backlight\", when the origin is behind the object, thus darkening and diluting its silhouette.In relation to the distribution of light in the painting, it can be: \"homogeneous\", when it is distributed equally; \"dual\", in which the figures stand out against a dark background; or \"insertive\", when light and shadows are interrelated. According to its origin, light can be intrinsic (\"own or autonomous light\"), when the light is homogeneous, without luminous effects, directional lights or contrasts of lights and shadows; or extrinsic (\"illuminating light\"), when it presents contrasts, directional lights and other objective sources of light. The first occurred mainly in Romanesque and Gothic art, and the second especially in the Renaissance and Baroque. In turn, the illuminating light can occur in different ways: \"focal light\", when it directly presents a light-emitting object (\"tangible light\") or comes from an external source that illuminates the painting (\"intangible light\"); \"diffuse light\", which blurs the contours, as in Leonardo\\'s sfumato; \"real light\", which aims to realistically capture sunlight, an almost utopian attempt in which artists such as Claude of Lorraine, J. M. W. Turner or the impressionist artists were especially employed; and \"unreal light\", which has no natural or scientific basis and is closer to a symbolic light, as in the illumination of religious figures. As for the artist\\'s intention, light can be \"compositional\", when it helps the composition of the painting, as in all the previous cases; or \"conceptual light\", when it serves to enhance the message, for example by illuminating a certain part of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness, as Caravaggio used to do.. In terms of its origin, light can be \"natural ambient light\", in which no shadows of figures or objects appear, or \"projected light\", which generates shadows and serves to model the figures. It is also important to differentiate between source and focus of light: the source of light in a painting is the element that radiates the light, be it the sun, a candle or any other; the focus of light is the part of the painting that has the most luminosity and radiates it around the painting. On the other hand, in relation to the shadow, the interrelation between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\"; if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\".Light in painting plays a decisive role in the composition and structuring of the painting. Unlike in architecture and sculpture, where light is real, the light of the surrounding space, in painting light is represented, so it responds to the will of the artist both in its physical and aesthetic aspect. The painter determines the illumination of the painting, that is to say, the origin and incidence of the light, which marks the composition and expression of the image. In turn, the shadow provides solidity and volume, while it can generate dramatic effects of various kinds.In the pictorial representation of light it is essential to distinguish its nature (natural, artificial) and to establish its origin, intensity and chromatic quality. Natural light depends on various factors, such as the season of the year, the time of day (auroral, diurnal, twilight or nocturnal light — from the moon or stars) or the weather. Artificial light, on the other hand, differs according to its origin: a candle, a torch, a fluorescent, a lamp, neon lights, etc. As for the origin, it can be focused or act in a diffuse way, without a determined origin. The chromatism of the image depends on the light, since depending on its incidence an object can have different tonalities, as well as the reflections, ambiances and shadows projected. In an illuminated image the color is considered saturated at the correct level of illumination, while the color in shadow will always have a darker tonal value and will be the one that determines the relief and volume.. Light is linked to space, so in painting it is intimately linked to perspective, the way of representing a three-dimensional space in a two-dimensional support such as painting. Thus, in linear perspective, light fulfills the function of highlighting objects, of generating volume, through modeling, in the form of luminous gradations; while in aerial perspective, the effects of light are sought as they are perceived by the spectator in the environment, as another element present in the physical reality represented. The light source can be present in the painting or not, it can have a direct or indirect origin, internal or external to the painting. The light defines the space through the modeling of volumes, which is achieved with the contrast between light and shadow: the relationship between the values of light and shadow defines the volumetric characteristics of the form, with a scale of values that can range from a soft fade to a hard contrast. Spatial limits can be objective, when they are produced by people, objects, architectures, natural elements and other factors of corporeality; or subjective, when they come from sensations such as atmosphere, depth, a hollow, an abyss, etc. In human perception, light creates closeness and darkness creates remoteness, so that a light-darkness gradient gives a sensation of depth.Aspects such as contrast, relief, texture, volume, gradients or the tactile quality of the image depend on light. The play of light and shadow helps to define the location and orientation of objects in space. For their correct representation, their shape, density and extension, as well as their differences in intensity, must be taken into account. It should also be taken into account that, apart from its physical qualities, light can generate dramatic effects and give the painting a certain emotional atmosphere.Contrast is a fundamental factor in painting; it is the language with which the image is shaped. There are two types of contrast: the \"luminous\", which can be by chiaroscuro (light and shadow) or by surface (a point of light that shines brighter than the rest); and the \"chromatic\", which can be tonal (contrast between two tones) or by saturation (a bright color with a neutral one). Both types of contrast are not mutually exclusive, in fact they coincide in the same image most of the time. Contrast can have different levels of intensity and its regulation is the artist\\'s main tool to achieve the appropriate expression for his work. From the contrast between light and shadow depends the tonal expression that the artist wants to give to his work, which can range from softness to hardness, which gives a lesser or greater degree of dramatization. Backlighting, for example, is one of the resources that provide greater drama, since it produces elongated shadows and darker tones.. The correspondence between light and shadow and color is achieved through tonal evaluation: the lightest tones are found in the most illuminated areas of the painting and the darkest in those that receive less illumination. Once the artist establishes the tonal values, he chooses the most appropriate color ranges for their representation. Colors can be lightened or darkened until the desired effect is achieved: to lighten a color, lighter related colors — such as groups of warm or cool colors — are added to it, as well as amounts of white until the right tone is found; to darken, related dark colors and some blue or shadow are added. In general, the shade is made by mixing a color with a darker shade, plus blue and a complementary of the proper color (such as yellow and dark blue, red and primary blue or magenta and green).The light and chromatic harmony of a painting depends on color, i.e. the relationship between the parts of a painting to create cohesion. There are several ways to harmonize: it can be done through \"monochrome and tone dominant melodic ranges\", with a single color as a base to which the value and tone is changed; if the value is changed with white or black it is a monochrome, while if the tone is changed it is a simple melodic range: for example, taking red as the dominant tone can be shaded with various shades of red (vermilion, cadmium, carmine) or orange, pink, violet, maroon, salmon, warm gray, etc. Another method is the \"harmonic trios\", which consists of combining three colors equidistant from each other on the chromatic circle; there can also be four, in which case we speak of \"quaternions\". Another way is the combination of \"warm and cool thermal ranges\": warm colors are for example red, orange, purple and yellowish green, as well as black; cool colors are blue, green and violet, as well as white (this perception of color with respect to its temperature is subjective and comes from Goethe\\'s Theory of Colors). It is also possible to harmonize between \"complementary colors\", which is the one that produces the greatest chromatic contrast. Finally, \"broken ranges\" consist of neutralization by mixing primary colors and their complementary colors, which produces intense luminous effects, since the chromatic vibration is more subtle and the saturated colors stand out more. Techniques. The quality and appearance of the luminous representation is in many cases linked to the technique used. The expression and the different light effects of a work depend to a great extent on the different techniques and materials used. In drawing, whether in pencil or charcoal, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality, where white is generally the color of the paper (there are colored pencils, but they produce little contrast, so they are not very suitable for chiaroscuro and light effects). Pencil is usually worked with line and hatching, or by means of blurred spots. Charcoal allows the use of gouache and chalk or white chalk to add touches of light, as well as sanguine or sepia. Another monochrome technique is Indian ink, which generates very violent chiaroscuro, without intermediate values, making it a very expressive medium.. Oil painting consists of dissolving the colors in an oily binder (linseed, walnut, almond or hazelnut oil; animal oils), adding turpentine to make it dry better. The oil painting is the one that best allows to value the light effects and the chromatic tones. It is a technique that produces vivid colors and intense effects of brightness and brilliance, and allows a free and fresh stroke, as well as a great richness of textures. On the other hand, thanks to its long permanence in a fluid state, it allows for subsequent corrections.For its application, brushes, spatulas or scrapers can be used, allowing multiple textures, from thin layers and glazes to thick fillings, which produce a denser light.Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil of various mineral colors, with binders (kaolin, gypsum, gum arabic, fig latex, fish glue, candi sugar, etc.), kneaded with wax and Marseilles soap and cut into sticks. The color should be spread with a smudger, a cylinder of leather or paper used to smudge the color strokes. Pastel combines the qualities of drawing and painting, and brings freshness and spontaneity.Watercolor is a technique made with transparent pigments diluted in water, with binders such as gum arabic or honey, using the white of the paper itself. Known since ancient Egypt, it has been a technique used throughout the ages, although with more intensity during the 18th and 19th centuries. As it is a wet technique, it provides great transparency, which highlights the luminous effect of the white color. Generally, the light tones are applied first, leaving spaces on the paper for the pure white; then the dark tones are applied.In acrylic paint, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents. The speed of drying allows the addition of multiple layers to correct defects and produces flat colors and glazes. Acrylic can be worked by gradient, blurred or contrasted, by flat spots or by filling the color, as in the oil technique. Genres. Depending on the pictorial genre, light has different considerations, since its incidence is different in interiors than in exteriors, on objects than on people. In interiors, light generally tends to create intimate environments, usually a type of indirect light filtered through doors or windows, or filtered by curtains or other elements. In these spaces, private scenes are usually developed, which are reinforced by contrasts of light and shadow, intense or soft, natural or artificial, with areas in semi-darkness and atmospheres influenced by gravitating dust and other effects caused by these spaces. A separate genre of interior painting is naturaleza muerta or \"still life\", which usually shows a series of objects or food arranged as in a sideboard. In these works the artist can manipulate the light at will, generally with dramatic effects such as side lights, frontal lights, zenithal lights, back lights, back-lights, etc. The main difficulty consists in the correct evaluation of the tones and textures of the objects, as well as their brightness and transparency depending on the material.In exteriors, the main genre is landscape, perhaps the most relevant in relation to light in that its presence is fundamental, since any exterior is enveloped in a luminous atmosphere determined by the time of day and the weather and environmental conditions. There are three main types of landscapes: landscape, seascape, and skyscape. The main challenge for the artist in these works is to capture the precise tone of the natural light according to the time of day, the season of the year, the viewing conditions — which can be affected by phenomena such as cloud cover, rain or fog — and an infinite number of variables that can occur in a medium as volatile as the landscape. On numerous occasions artists have gone out to paint in nature to capture their impressions first hand, a working method known by the French term en plen air (\"in the open air\", equivalent to \"outdoors\"). There is also the variant of the urban landscape, frequent especially since the 20th century, in which a factor to take into account is the artificial illumination of the cities and the presence of neon lights and other types of effects; in general, in these images the planes and contrasts are more differentiated, with hard shadows and artificial and grayish colors.. Light is also fundamental for the representation of the human figure in painting, since it affects the volume and generates different limits according to the play of light and shadow, which delimits the anatomical profile. Light allows us to nuance the surface of the body, and provides a sensation of smoothness and softness to the skin. The focus of the light is important, since its direction influences the general contour of the figure and the illumination of its surroundings: for example, frontal light makes the shadows disappear, attenuating the volume and the sensation of depth, while emphasizing the color of the skin. On the other hand, a partially lateral illumination causes shadows and gives relief to the volumes, and if it is from the side, the shadow covers the opposite side of the figure, which appears with an enhanced volume. On the other hand, in backlighting the body is shown with a characteristic halo around its contour, while the volume acquires a weightless sensation. With overhead lighting, the projection of shadows blurs the relief and gives a somewhat ghostly appearance, just as it does when illuminated from below — although the latter is rare. A determining factor is that of the shadows, which generate a series of contours apart from the anatomical ones that provide drama to the image. Together with the luminous reflections, the gradation of shadows generates a series of effects of great richness in the figure, which the artist can exploit in different ways to achieve different results of greater or lesser effect. It should also be taken into account that direct light or shadow on the skin modifies the color, varying the tonality from the characteristic pale pink to gray or white. The light can also be filtered by objects that get in its path (such as curtains, fabrics, vases or various objects), which generates different effects and colors on the skin.In relation to the human being, the portrait genre is characteristic, in which light plays a decisive role in the modeling of the face. Its elaboration is based on the same premises as those of the human body, with the addition of a greater demand in the faithful representation of the physiognomic features and even the need to capture the psychology of the character. The drawing is essential to model the features according to the model and, from there, light and color are again the vehicle of translation of the visual image to its representation on the canvas.In the 20th century, abstraction emerged as a new pictorial language, in which painting is reduced to non-figurative images that no longer describe reality, but rather concepts or sensations of the artist himself, who plays with form, color, light, matter, space and other elements in a totally subjective way and not subject to conventionalisms. Despite the absence of concrete images of the surrounding reality, light is still present on numerous occasions, generally contributing luminosity to the colors or creating chiaroscuro effects by contrasting tonal values. Chronological factor. Another aspect in which light is a determining factor is in time, in the representation of chronological time in painting. Until the Renaissance, artists did not represent a specific time in painting and, in general, the only difference in light was between exterior and interior lights. In many occasions it is difficult to identify the specific time of day in a work, since neither the direction of the light nor its quality nor the dimension of the shadows are decisive elements to recognize a certain time of day. Night was rarely represented until practically Mannerism and, in the cases in which a nocturnal atmosphere was used, it was because the narrative required it or because of some symbolic aspect: in Giotto\\'s The Annunciation to the Shepherds or in Ambrogio Lorenzetti\\'s Annunciation, the nocturnal atmosphere contributes to accentuate the halo of mystery surrounding the birth of Christ; in Uccello\\'s Saint George and the Dragon, night represents evil, the world in which the dragon lives. On the other hand, even in narrative themes that take place at night, such as the Last Supper or the supper at Emmaus, this factor is sometimes deliberately avoided, as in Andrea del Sarto\\'s Last Supper, set in daylight.Generally, the chronological setting of a scene has been linked to its narrative correlate, albeit in an approximate manner and with certain licenses on the part of the artist. Practically until the 19th century, it was not until the industrial civilization, thanks to the advances in artificial lighting, that a complete and exact use of the entire time zone was achieved, thanks to the advances in artificial illumination. But just as in the contemporary age time has had a more realistic component, in the past it was more of a narrative factor, accompanying the action represented: dawn was a time of travel or hunting; noon, of action or its subsequent rest; dusk, of return or reflection; night was sleep, fear or adventure, or fun and passion; birth was morning, death was night.. The temporal dimension began to gain relevance in the 17th century, when artists such as Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa began to detach landscape painting from a narrative context and to produce works in which the protagonist was nature, with the only variations being the time of day or the season of the year. This new conception developed with 18th century\\'s Vedutism and 19th century\\'s Romantic landscape, and culminated with the Impressionism.The first light of the day is that of dawn, sunrise or aurora (sometimes the aurora, which would be the first brightness of the sky, is differentiated from dawn, which would correspond to sunrise). Until the 17th century, dawn appeared only in small pieces of landscape, usually behind a door or a window, but was never used to illuminate the foreground. The light of dawn generally has a spherical effect, so until the appearance of Leonardo\\'s aerial perspective it was not widely used. In his Dictionary of the Fine Arts of Design (1797), Francesco Milizia states that: The dawn sweetly colors the extremity of the bodies, begins to dissipate the darkness of the night and the air still full of vapors leaves the objects wavering.... But the sun has not yet appeared, therefore the shadows cannot be very sensitive. All the bodies must participate in the freshness of the air and remain in a kind of half-ink. [...] The background of the sky wants to be dark blue... so that the celestial vault stands out better and the origin of light appears: there the sky will be colored of a reddish-red incarnation from a certain height with alternating golden and silver bands, which will diminish in vivacity as they move away from the place from where the light comes out.For Milizia, the light of dawn was the most suitable for the representation of landscapes.Noon and the hours immediately before and after have always been a stable frame for an objective representation of reality, although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact moment in most paintings depending on the different light intensities. On the other hand, the exact noon was discouraged by its extreme refulgence, to the point that Leonardo advised that: If you do it at noon, keep the window covered in such a way that the sun, illuminating it all day, does not change the situation.. Milizia also points out that: Can the painter imitate the brightness of midday that dazzles the eye? No; then let him not do so. If ever an event should be treated at noon, let the sun be hidden among clouds, trees, mountains and buildings, and let that star be pointed out by means of some rays that escape those obstacles. Let it be considered then that the bodies do not give shadows, or little, and that the colors, by the excessive vivacity of the light, appear less vivid than in the hours when the light is more attenuated.. Most art treatises advised the afternoon light, which was the most used especially from the Renaissance to the 18th century. Vasari advised to place the sun to the east because \"the figure that is made has a great relief and great goodness and perfection is achieved\".In the early days of modern painting, the sunset used to be circumscribed to a celestial vault characterized by its reddish color, without an exact correspondence with the illumination of figures and objects. It was again with Leonardo that a more naturalistic study of twilight began, pointing out in his notes that: The reddening of the clouds, together with the reddening of the sun, makes everything that takes light from them redden; and the part of the bodies which is not seen that reddening remains of the color of the air, and whoever sees such bodies seems to him that they are of two colors; and from this you cannot escape since, showing the cause of such shadows and lights, you must make the shadows and lights participants of the said causes, otherwise your work is vain and false.For Milizia this moment is risky, since \"the more splendid these accidents are (the flaming twilight is always an excess), the more they must be observed to represent them well\".Finally, the night has always been a singularity within painting, to the point of constituting a genre of its own: the nocturne. In these scenes the light comes from the moon, the stars or from some type of artificial illumination (bonfires, torches, candles or, more recently, gas or electric light). The justification for a night scene has generally been given from iconographic themes occurring in this time period. In the 14th century painting began to move away from the symbolic and conceptual content of medieval art in search of a figurative content based on a more objective spatio-temporal axis. Renaissance artists were refractory to the nocturnal setting, since their experimentation in the field of linear perspective required an objective and stable frame in which full light was indispensable. Thus, Lorenzo Ghiberti stated that \"it is not possible to be seen in darkness\" and Leonardo wrote that \"darkness means complete deprivation of light\". Leonardo advised a night scene only with the illumination of a fire, as a mere artifice to make a night scene diurnal. However, Leonardo\\'s sfumato opened a first door to a naturalistic representation of the night, thanks to the chromatic decrease in the distance in which the bluish white of Leonardo\\'s luminous air can become a bluish black for the night: just as the first creates an effect of remoteness, the second provokes closeness, the dilution of the background in the gloom. This tendency will have its climax in baroque tenebrism, in which darkness is used to add drama to the scene and to emphasize certain parts of the painting, often with a symbolic aspect. On the other hand, in the 17th century the representation of the night acquired a more scientific character, especially thanks to the invention of the telescope by Galileo and a more detailed observation of the night sky. Finally, advances in artificial lighting in the 19th century boosted the conquest of nighttime, which became a time for leisure and entertainment, a circumstance that was especially captured by the Impressionists.. All that of being a painter consists in distinguishing the light of each day of the week, more than in distinguishing colors. Who does not distinguish red from blue and yellow? But there are very few who distinguish the light of Sunday from that of Friday or Wednesday. Symbology. Light has had on numerous occasions throughout the history of painting an aesthetic component, which identifies light with beauty, as well as a symbolic meaning, especially related to religion, but also with knowledge, good, happiness and life, or in general the spiritual and immaterial. Sometimes the light of the Sun has been equated with inspiration and imagination, and that of the Moon with rational thought. In contrast, shadows and darkness represent evil, death, ignorance, immorality, misfortune or secrecy. Thus, many religions and philosophies throughout history have been based on the dichotomy between light and darkness, such as Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, yin and yang, angels and demons, spirit and matter, and so on. In general, light has been associated with the immaterial and spiritual, probably because of its ethereal and weightless aspect, and that association has often been extended to other concepts related to light, such as color, shadow, radiance, evanescence, etc.The identification of light with a transcendent meaning comes from antiquity and probably existed in the minds of many artists and religious people before the idea was written down. In many ancient religions the deity was identified with light, such as the Semitic Baal, the Egyptian Ra or the Iranian Ahura Mazda. Primitive peoples already had a transcendental concept of light — the so-called \"metaphor of light\" — generally linked to immortality, which related the afterlife to starlight. Many cultures sketched a place of infinite light where the souls rested, a concept also picked up by Aristotle and various Fathers of the Church such as Saint Basil and Saint Augustine. On the other hand, many religious rites were based on \"illumination\" to purify the soul, from ancient Babylon to the Pythagoreans.In Greek mythology Apollo was the god of the Sun and has often been depicted in art within a disk of light. On the other hand, Apollo was also the god of beauty and the arts, a clear symbolism between light and these two concepts. Also related to light is the goddess of dawn, Eos (Aurora in Roman mythology). In Ancient Greece, light was synonymous with life and was also related to beauty. Sometimes the fluctuation of light was related to emotional changes, as well as to intellectual capacity. On the other hand, the shadow had a negative component, it was related to the dark and hidden, to evil forces, such as the spectral shadows of Tartarus. The Greeks also related the sun to \"intelligent light\" (φῶς νοετόν), a driving principle of the movement of the universe, and Plato drew a parallel between light and knowledge.The ancient Romans distinguished between lux (luminous source) and lumen (rays of light emanating from that source), terms they used according to the context: thus, for example, lux gloriae or lux intelligibilis, or lumen naturale or lumen gratiae.In Christianity, God is also often associated with light, a tradition that goes back to the philosopher Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagite (On the Celestial Hierarchy, On the Divine Names), who adapted a similar one from Neoplatonism. For this 5th century author, \"Light derives from Good and is the image of Goodness\". Later, in the 9th century, John Scotus Erigena defined God as \"the father of lights\". Already the Bible begins with the phrase \"let there be light\" (Ge 1:3) and points out that \"God saw that the light was good\" (Ge 1:4). This \"good\" had in Hebrew a more ethical sense, but in its translation into Greek the term καλός (kalós, \"beautiful\") was used, in the sense of kalokagathía, which identified goodness and beauty; although later in the Latin Vulgate a more literal translation was made (bonum instead of pulchrum), it remained fixed in the Christian mentality the idea of the intrinsic beauty of the world as the work of the Creator. On the other hand, the Holy Scriptures identify light with God, and Jesus goes so far as to affirm: \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me will not walk in darkness, for he will have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This identification of light with divinity led to the incorporation in Christian churches of a lamp known as \"eternal light\", as well as the custom of lighting candles to remember the dead and various other rites.. Light is also present in other areas of the Christian religion: the Conception of Jesus in Mary is realized in the form of a ray of light, as seen in numerous representations of the Annunciation; likewise, it represents the Incarnation, as expressed by Pseudo-Saint Bernard: \"as the splendor of the sun passes through glass without breaking it and penetrates its solidity in its impalpable subtlety, without opening it when it enters and without breaking it when it leaves, so the Word God penetrates Mary\\'s womb and comes forth from her womb intact.\" This symbolism of light passing through glass is the same concept that was applied to Gothic stained glass, where light symbolizes divine omnipresence. Another symbolism related to light is that which identifies Jesus with the Sun and Mary as the Dawn that precedes him. In addition to all this, in Christianity light can also signify truth, virtue and salvation. In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be \"plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity\". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called \"illumination\".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a \"real aspect of divinity,\" according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires.. In Christian iconography, light is also present in the halos of the saints, which used to be made —especially in medieval art — with a golden nimbus, a circle of light placed around the heads of saints, angels and members of the Holy Family. In Fra Angelico\\'s The Annunciation, in addition to the halo, the artist placed rays of light radiating from the figure of the archangel Gabriel, to emphasize his divinity, the same resource he uses with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. On other occasions, it is God himself who is represented in the form of rays of sunlight, as in The Baptism of Christ (1445) by Piero della Francesca. The rays can also signify God\\'s wrath, as in The Tempest (1505) by Giorgione. On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Grünewald\\'s Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian\\'s Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects — generally made with gold leaf — was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death. Descartes spoke of an \"inner light\" capable of capturing the \"eternal truths\", a concept also taken up by Leibniz, who distinguished between lumière naturelle (natural light) and lumière révélée (revealed light).In the 19th century light was related by the German Romantics (Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) to nature, in a pantheistic sense of communion with nature. For Schelling, light was a medium in which the \"universal soul\" (Weltseele) moved. For Hegel, light was the \"ideality of matter\", the foundation of the material world.Between the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed. Science had been trying to unravel the nature of light since the early Modern Age, with two main theories: the corpuscular theory, defended by Descartes and Newton; and the wave theory, defended by Christiaan Huygens, Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Later, James Clerk Maxwell presented an electromagnetic theory of light. Finally, Albert Einstein brought together the corpuscular and wave theories.Light can also have a symbolic character in landscape painting: in general, dawn and the passage from night to day represent the divine plan — or cosmic system — that transcends the simple will of the human being; dawn also symbolizes the renewal and redemption of Christ. On other occasions, the sun and the moon have been associated with various vital forces: thus, the sun and the day are associated with the masculine, the vital force and energy; and the moon and the night with the feminine, rest, sleep and spirituality, sometimes even death.In other religions light also has a transcendent meaning: in Buddhism it represents truth and the overcoming of matter in the ascent to nirvana. In Hinduism it is synonymous with wisdom and the spiritual understanding of participation with divinity (atman); it is also the manifestation of Krishna, the \"Lord of Light\". In Islam it is the sacred name Nûr. According to the Koran (24:35), \"Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. Light upon light! Allah guides to his light whomever he wills\". In the Zohar of the Jewish Kabbalah the primordial light Or (or Awr) appears, and points out that the universe is divided between the empires of light and darkness; also in Jewish synagogues there is usually a lamp of \"eternal light\" or ner tamid. Finally, in Freemasonry, the search for light is considered the ascent to the various Masonic degrees; some of the Masonic symbols, such as the compass, the bevel and the holy book, are called \"great lights\"; also the principal Masonic officials are called \"lights\". On the other hand, initiation into Freemasonry is called \"receiving the light\". Light is the most joyful of things: it is the symbol of all that is good and wholesome. In all religions it signifies eternal salvation. History. The use of light is intrinsic to painting, so it has been present directly or indirectly since prehistoric times, when cave paintings sought light and relief effects by taking advantage of the roughness of the walls where these scenes were represented. However, serious attempts at greater experimentation in the technical representation of light did not take place until classical Greco-Roman art: Francisco Pacheco, in El arte de la pintura (1649), points out that: \"adumbration was invented by Surias, Samian, covering or staining the shadow of a horse, looked at in the sunlight\". On the other hand, Apollodorus of Athens is credited with the invention of chiaroscuro, a procedure of contrast between light and shadow to produce effects of luminous reality in a two-dimensional representation such as painting. The effects of light and shadow were also developed by Greek scenographers in a technique called skiagraphia, consisting of the contrast between black and white to create contrast, to the point that they were called \"shadow painters\".The first scientific studies on light also emerged in Greece: Aristotle stated in relation to colors that they are \"mixtures of different forces of sunlight and the light of fire, air and water\", as well as that \"darkness is due to the deprivation of light\". One of the most famous Greek painters was Apelles, one of the pioneers in the representation of light in painting. Pliny said of Apelles that he was the only one who \"painted what cannot be painted, thunder, lightning and thunderbolts\". Another outstanding painter was Nicias of Athens, of whom Pliny praised the \"care he took with light and shade to achieve the appearance of relief\".With the emergence of landscape painting, a new method was developed to represent distance through gradations of light and shadow, contrasting more the plane closest to the viewer and progressively blurring with distance. These early landscape painters created the modeling through shades of light and shadow, without mixing the colors in the palette. Claudius Ptolemy explained in his Optics how painters created the illusion of depth through distances that seemed \"veiled by air\". In general, the strongest contrasts were made in the areas closest to the observer and progressively reduced towards the background. This technique was picked up by early Christian and Byzantine art, as seen in the apsidal mosaic of Sant\\'Apollinare in Classe, and even reached as far as India, as denoted in the Buddhist murals of Ajantā.In the 5th century the philosopher John Philoponus, in his commentary on Aristotle\\'s Meteorology, outlined a theory on the subjective effect of light and shadow in painting, known today as \"Philoponus\\' rule\": If we apply black and white on the same surface and then look at them from a distance, the white will always appear much closer and the black much farther away. So when painters want something to look hollow, like a well, a cistern, a ditch or a cave, they paint it black or brown. But when they want something to appear prominent, such as a girl\\'s breasts, an outstretched hand or a horse\\'s legs, they apply black over the adjoining areas so that they appear to recede and the parts in between appear to come forward.. This effect was already known empirically by ancient painters. Cicero was of the opinion that painters saw more than normal people in umbris et eminentia (\"in shadows and eminences\"), that is, depth and protrusion. And Pseudo-Longinus — in his work On the Sublime — said that \"although the colors of shadow and light are on the same plane, side by side, the light jumps immediately into view and seems not only to stand out but actually to be closer.\"Hellenistic art was fond of light effects, especially in landscape painting, as denoted in the stuccoes of La Farnesina. Chiaroscuro was widely used in Roman painting, as denoted in the illusory architectures of the frescoes of Pompeii, although it disappeared during the Middle Ages. Vitruvius recommended as more suitable for painting the northern light, being more constant due to its low mutability in tone. Later, in Paleochristian art, the taste for contrasts between light and shadow became evident — as can be seen in Christian sepulchral paintings and in the mosaics of Santa Pudenciana and Santa María la Mayor — in such a way that this style has sometimes been called \"ancient impressionism\".Byzantine art inherited the use of illusionistic touches of light that were used in Pompeian art, but just as in the original its main function was naturalistic, here it is already a rhetorical formula far removed from the representation of reality. In Byzantine art, as well as in Romanesque art, which it powerfully influenced, the luminosity and splendor of shines and reflections, especially of gold and precious stones, were more valued, with a more aesthetic than pictorial component, since these shines were synonymous of beauty, of a type of beauty more spiritual than material. These briils were identified with the divine light, as did Abbot Suger to justify his expenditure on jewels and precious materials.Both Greek and Roman art laid the foundations of the style known as classicism, whose main premises are truthfulness, proportion and harmony. Classicist painting is fundamentally based on drawing as a preliminary design tool, on which the pigment is applied taking into account a correct proportion of chromaticism and shading. These precepts laid the foundations of a way of understanding art that has lasted throughout history, with a series of cyclical ups and downs that have been followed to a greater or lesser extent: some of the periods in which the classical canons have been returned to were the Renaissance, Baroque classicism, neoclassicism and academicism. Medieval art. The art historian Wolfgang Schöne divided the history of painting in terms of light into two periods: \"proper light\" (eigenlicht), which would correspond to medieval art; and \"illuminating light\" (beleuchtungslicht), which would develop in modern and contemporary art (Über das Licht in der Malerei, Berlin, 1979).In the Middle Ages, light had a strong symbolic component in art, since it was considered a reflection of divinity. Within medieval scholastic philosophy, a current called the aesthetics of light emerged, which identified light with divine beauty, and greatly influenced medieval art, especially Gothic art: the new Gothic cathedrals were brighter, with large windows that flooded the interior space, which was indefinite, without limits, as a concretion of an absolute, infinite beauty. The introduction of new architectural elements such as the pointed arch and the ribbed vault, together with the use of buttresses and flying buttresses to support the weight of the building, allowed the opening of windows covered with stained glass that filled the interior with light, which gained in transparency and luminosity. These stained-glass windows allowed the light that entered through them to be nuanced, creating fantastic plays of light and color, fluctuating at different times of the day, which were reflected in a harmonious way in the interior of the buildings.. Light was associated with divinity, but also with beauty and perfection: according to Saint Bonaventure (De Intelligentii), the perfection of a body depends on its luminosity (\"perfectio omnium eorum quae sunt in ordine universo, est lux\"). William of Auxerre (Summa Aurea) also related beauty and light, so that a body is more or less beautiful according to its degree of radiance. This new aesthetics was parallel in many moments to the advances of science in subjects such as optics and the physics of light, especially thanks to the studies of Roger Bacon. At this time the works of Alhacen were also known, which would be collected by Witelo in De perspectiva (ca. 1270-1278) and Adam Pulchrae Mulieris in Liber intelligentiis (ca. 1230).. The new prominence given to light in medieval times had a powerful influence on all artistic genres, to the point that Daniel Boorstein points out that \"it was the power of light that produced the most modern artistic forms, because light, the almost instantaneous messenger of sensation, is the swiftest and most transitory element\". In addition to architecture, light had a special influence on the miniature, with manuscripts illuminated with bright and brilliant colors, generally thanks to the use of pure colors (white, red, blue, green, gold and silver), which gave the image a great luminosity, without shades or chiaroscuro. The conjugation of these elementary colors generates light by the overall concordance, thanks to the approximation of the inks, without having to resort to shading effects to outline the contours. The light radiates from the objects, which are luminous without the need for the play of volumes that will be characteristic of modern painting. In particular, the use of gold in medieval miniatures generated areas of great light intensity, often contrasted with cold and light tones, to provide greater chromaticism.However, in painting, light did not have the prominence it had in architecture: medieval \"proper light\" was alien to reality and without contact with the spectator, since it neither came from outside — lacking a light source — nor went outward, since it did not expand light. Chiaroscuro was not used, since shadow was forbidden as it was considered a refuge for evil. Light was considered of divine origin and conqueror of darkness, so it illuminated everything equally, with the consequence of the lack of modeling and volume in the objects, a fact that resulted in the weightless and incorporeal image that was sought to emphasize spirituality. Although there is a greater interest in the representation of light, it is more symbolic than naturalistic. Just as in architecture the stained glass windows created a space where illumination took on a transcendent character, in painting a spatial staging was developed through gold backgrounds, which although they did not represent a physical space, they did represent a metaphysical realm, linked to the sacred. This \"gothic light\" was a feigned illumination and created a type of unreal image that transcended mere nature.. The \"unnatural\" light of Gothic art is also presented as the bearer of a world of images of great figurative opulence, whose power acts with extraordinary force on the soul of man.. The gold background reinforced the sacred symbolism of light: the figures are immersed in an indeterminate space of unnatural light, a scenario of sacred character where figures and objects are part of the religious symbolism. Cennino Cennini (Il libro dell\\'Arte), compiled various technical procedures for the use of gold leaf in painting (backgrounds, draperies, nimbuses), which remained in force until the 16th century. Gold leaf was used profusely, especially in halos and backgrounds, as can be seen in Duccio\\'s Maestà, which shone brightly in the interior of the cathedral of Siena. Sometimes, before applying the gold leaf, a layer of red clay was spread; after wetting the surface and placing the gold leaf, it was smoothed and polished with ivory or a smooth stone. To achieve more brilliance and to catch the light, incisions were made in the gilding. It is noteworthy that in early Gothic painting there are no shadows, but the entire representation is uniformly illuminated; according to Hans Jantzen, \"to the extent that medieval painting suppresses the shadow, it raises its sensitive light to the power of a super-sensible light\".In Gothic painting there is a progressive evolution in the use of light: the linear or Franco-Gothic Gothic was characterized by linear drawing and strong chromaticism, and gave greater importance to the luminosity of flat color than to tonality, emphasizing chromatic pigment as opposed to luminous gradation. With the Italic or Trecentist Gothic a more naturalistic use of light began, characterized by the approach to the representation of depth — which would crystallize in the Renaissance with the linear perspective — the studies on anatomy and the analysis of light to achieve tonal nuance, as seen in the work of Cimabue, Giotto, Duccio, Simone Martini, and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. In the Flemish Gothic period, the technique of oil painting emerged, which provided brighter colors and allowed their gradation in different chromatic ranges, while facilitating greater detail in the details (Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, Gerard David).Between the 13th and 14th centuries a new sensibility towards a more naturalistic representation of reality emerged in Italy, which had as one of its contributing factors the study of a realistic light in the pictorial composition. In the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel (Padua), Giotto studied how to distinguish flat and curved surfaces by the presence or absence of gradients and how to distinguish the orientation of flat surfaces by three tones: lighter for horizontal surfaces, medium for frontal vertical surfaces and darker for receding vertical surfaces. Giotto was the first painter to represent sunlight, a type of soft, transparent illumination, but one that already served to model figures and enhance the quality of clothes and objects. For his part, Taddeo Gaddi — in his Annunciation to the Shepherds (Baroncelli Chapel, Santa Croce, Florence) — depicted divine light in a night scene with a visible light source and a rapid fall in the pattern of light distribution characteristic of point sources of light, through contrasts of yellow and violet.. In the Netherlands, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin sought to capture various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen, imitating the reflections of light on mirrors and metallic surfaces and highlighting the brilliance of colored jewels and gems (Triptych of Mérode, by Campin, 1425-1428; Polyptych of Ghent, by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, 1432). Hubert was the first to develop a certain sense of saturation of light in his Hours of Turin (1414-1417), in which he recreated the first \"modern landscapes\" of Western painting — according to Kenneth Clark. In these small landscapes the artist recreates effects such as the reflection of the evening sky on the water or the light sparkling on the waves of a lake, effects that would not be seen again until the Dutch landscape painting of the 17th century. In the Ghent Polyptych (1432, Saint Bavo\\'s Cathedral, Ghent), by Hubert and Jan, the landscape of The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb melts into light in the celestial background, with a subtlety that only the Baroque Claude of Lorraine would later achieve.Jan van Eyck developed the light experiments of his brother and managed to capture an atmospheric luminosity of naturalistic aspect in his works, in paintings such as The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin (1435, Louvre Museum, Paris), or The Arnolfini Marriage (1434, The National Gallery, London), where he combines the natural light that enters through two side windows with that of a single candle lit on the candlestick, which here has a more symbolic than plastic value, since it symbolizes human life. In Van Eyck\\'s workshop, oil painting was developed, which gave a greater luminosity to the painting thanks to the glazes: in general, they applied a first layer of tempera, more opaque, on which they applied the oil (pigments ground in oil), which is more transparent, through several thin layers that let the light pass through, achieving greater luminosity, depth and tonal and chromatic richness.. Other Dutch artists who stood out in the expression of light were: Dirk Bouts, who in his works enhances with light the coloring and, in general, the plastic sense of the composition; Petrus Christus, whose use of light approaches a certain abstraction of the forms; and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, author in some of his works of surprising light effects, as in his Nativity (1490, National Gallery, London), where the light emanates from the body of the Child Jesus in the cradle, symbol of the Divine Grace. Modern Age Art. Renaissance. The art of the Modern Age — not to be confused with modern art, which is often used as a synonym for contemporary art — began with the Renaissance, which emerged in Italy in the 15th century (Quattrocento), a style influenced by classical Greco-Roman art and inspired by nature, with a more rational and measured component, based on harmony and proportion. Linear perspective emerged as a new method of composition and light became more naturalistic, with an empirical study of physical reality. Renaissance culture meant a return to rationalism, the study of nature, empirical research, with a special influence of classical Greco-Roman philosophy. Theology took a back seat and the object of study of the philosopher returned to the human being (humanism).In the Renaissance, the use of canvas as a support and the technique of oil painting became widespread, especially in Venice from 1460. Oil painting provided a greater chromatic richness and facilitated the representation of brightness and light effects, which could be represented in a wider range of shades. In general, Renaissance light tended to be intense in the foreground, diminishing progressively towards the background. It was a fixed lighting, which meant an abstraction with respect to reality, since it created an aseptic space subordinated to the idealizing character of Renaissance painting; to reconvert this ideal space into a real atmosphere, a slow process was followed based on the subordination of volumetric values to lighting effects, through the dissolution of the solidity of forms in the luminous space.. During this period, chiaroscuro was recovered as a method to give relief to objects, while the study of gradation as a technique to diminish the intensity of color and modeling to graduate the different values of light and shadow was deepened. Renaissance natural light not only determined the space of the pictorial composition, but also the volume of figures and objects. It is a light that loses the metaphorical character of Gothic light and becomes a tool for measuring and ordering reality, shaping a plastic space through a naturalistic representation of light effects. Even when light retains a metaphorical reference — in religious scenes — it is a light subordinated to the realistic composition.Light had a special relevance in landscape painting, a genre in which it signified the transition from a symbolic representation in medieval art to a naturalistic transcription of reality. Light is the medium that unifies all parts of the composition into a structured and coherent whole. According to Kenneth Clark, \"the sun shines for the first time in the landscape of the Flight into Egypt that Gentile da Fabriano painted in his Adoration of 1423. This sun is a golden disk, which is reminiscent of medieval symbolism, but its light is already fully naturalistic, spilling over the hillside, casting shadows and creating the compositional space of the image.. In the Renaissance, the first theoretical treatises on the representation of light in painting appeared: Leonardo da Vinci dedicated a good part of his Treatise on Painting to the scientific study of light. Albrecht Dürer investigated a mathematical procedure to determine the location of shadows cast by objects illuminated by point source lights, such as candlelight. Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo devoted the fourth book of his Trattato (1584) to light, in which he arranged light in descending order from primary sunlight, divine light and artificial light to the weaker secondary light reflected by illuminated bodies. Cennino Cennini took up in his treatise Il libro dell\\'arte the rule of Philoponus on the creation of distance by contrasts: \"the farther away you want the mountains to appear, the darker you will make your color; and the closer you want them to appear, the lighter you will make the colors\".Another theoretical reference was Leon Battista Alberti, who in his treatise De pictura (1435) pointed out the indissolubility of light and color, and affirmed that \"philosophers say that no object is visible if it is not illuminated and has no color. Therefore they affirm that between light and color there is a great interdependence, since they make themselves reciprocally visible\". In his treatise, Alberti pointed out three fundamental concepts in painting: circumscriptio (drawing, outline), compositio (arrangement of the elements), and luminum receptio (illumination). He stated that color is a quality of light and that to color is to \"give light\" to a painting. Alberti pointed out that relief in painting was achieved by the effects of light and shadow (lumina et umbrae), and warned that \"on the surface on which the rays of light fall the color is lighter and more luminous, and that the color becomes darker where the strength of the light gradually diminishes.\" Likewise, he spoke of the use of white as the main tool for creating brilliance: \"the painter has nothing but white pigment (album colorem) to imitate the flash (fulgorem) of the most polished surfaces, just as he has nothing but black to represent the most extreme darkness of the night. Thus, the darker the general tone of the painting, the more possibilities the artist has to create light effects, as they will stand out more.. Alberti\\'s theories greatly influenced Florentine painting in the mid-15th century, so much so that this style is sometimes called pittura di luce (light painting), represented by Domenico Veneziano, Fra Angelico, Paolo Uccello, Andrea del Castagno and the early works of Piero della Francesca.. Domenico Veneziano, who as his name indicates was originally from Venice but settled in Florence, was the introducer of a style based more on color than on line. In one of his masterpieces, The Virgin and Child with Saint Francis, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Cenobius and Saint Lucy (c. 1445, Uffizi, Florence), he achieved a believably naturalistic representation by combining the new techniques of representing light and space. The solidity of the forms is solidly based on the light-shadow modeling, but the image also has a serene and radiant atmosphere that comes from the clear sunlight that floods the courtyard where the scene takes place, one of the stylistic hallmarks of this artist.Fra Angelico synthesized the symbolism of the spiritual light of medieval Christianity with the naturalism of Renaissance scientific light. He knew how to distinguish between the light of dawn, noon and twilight, a diffuse and non-contrasting light, like an eternal spring, which gives his works an aura of serenity and placidity that reflects his inner spirituality. In Scenes from the Life of Saint Nicholas (1437, Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) he applied Alberti\\'s method of balancing illuminated and shaded halves, especially in the figure with his back turned and the mountainous background.. Uccello was also a great innovator in the field of pictorial lighting: in his works — such as The Battle of San Romano (1456, Musée du Louvre, Paris) — each object is conceived independently, with its own lighting that defines its corporeality, in conjunction with the geometric values that determine its volume. These objects are grouped together in a scenographic composition, with a type of artificial lighting reminiscent of that of the performing arts.. In turn, Piero della Francesca used light as the main element of spatial definition, establishing a system of volumetric composition in which even the figures are reduced to mere geometric outlines, as in The Baptism of Christ (1440-1445, The National Gallery, London). According to Giulio Carlo Argan, Piero did not consider \"a transmission of light, but a fixation of light\", which turns the figures into references of a certain definition of space. He carried out scientific studies of perspective and optics (De prospectiva pingendi) and in his works, full of a colorful luminosity of great beauty, he uses light as both an expressive and symbolic element, as can be seen in his frescoes of San Francesco in Arezzo. Della Francesca was one of the first modern artists to paint night scenes, such as The Dream of Constantine (Legend of the Cross, 1452-1466, San Francesco in Arezzo). He cleverly assimilated the luminism of the Flemish school, which he combined with Florentine spatialism: in some of his landscapes there are luminous moonscapes reminiscent of the Van Eyck brothers, although transcribed with the golden Mediterranean light of his native Umbria.Masaccio was a pioneer in using light to emphasize the drama of the scene, as seen in his frescoes in the Brancacci chapel of Santa Maria del Carmine (Florence), where he uses light to configure and model the volume, while the combination of light and shadow serves to determine the space. In these frescoes, Masaccio achieved a sense of perspective without resorting to geometry, as would be usual in linear perspective, but by distributing light among the figures and other elements of the representation. In The Tribute of the Coin, for example, he placed a light source outside the painting that illuminates the figures obliquely, casting shadows on the ground with which the artist plays.. Straddling the Gothic and Renaissance periods, Gentile da Fabriano was also a pioneer in the naturalistic use of light: in the predella of the Adoration of the Magi (1423, Uffizi, Florence) he distinguished between natural, artificial and supernatural light sources, using a technique of gold leaf and graphite to create the illusion of light through tonal modeling.. Sandro Botticelli was a Gothic painter who moved away from the naturalistic style initiated by Masaccio and returned to a certain symbolic concept of light. In The Birth of Venus (1483-1485, Uffizi, Florence), he symbolized the dichotomy between matter and spirit with the contrast between light and darkness, in line with the Neoplatonic theories of the Florentine Academy of which he was a follower: on the left side of the painting the light corresponds to the dawn, both physical and symbolic, since the female character that appears embracing Zephyrus is Aurora, the goddess of dawn; on the right side, darker, are the earth and the forest, as metaphorical elements of matter, while the character that tends a mantle to Venus is the Hour, which personifies time. Venus is in the center, between day and night, between sea and land, between the divine and the human.. A remarkable pictorial school emerged in Venice, characterized by the use of canvas and oil painting, where light played a fundamental role in the structuring of forms, while great importance was given to color: chromaticism would be the main hallmark of this school, as it would be in the 16th century with Mannerism. Its main representatives were Carlo Crivelli, Antonello da Messina, and Giovanni Bellini. In the Altarpiece of Saint Job (c. 1485, Gallerie dell\\'Accademia, Venice), Bellini brought together for the first time the Florentine linear perspective with Venetian color, combining space and atmosphere, and made the most of the new oil technique initiated in Flanders, thus creating a new artistic language that was quickly imitated. According to Kenneth Clark, Bellini \"was born with the landscape painter\\'s greatest gift: emotional sensitivity to light\". In his Christ on the Mount of Olives (1459, National Gallery, London) he made the effects of light the driving force of the painting, with a shadowy valley in which the rising sun peeks through the hills. This emotive light is also seen in his Resurrection at the Staatliche Museen in Berlin (1475-1479), where the figure of Jesus radiates a light that bathes the sleeping soldiers. While his early works are dominated by sunrises and sunsets, in his mature production he appreciates more the full light of day, in which the forms merge with the general atmosphere. However, he also knew how to take advantage of the cold and pale lights of winter, as in the Virgin of the Meadow (1505, National Gallery, London), where a pale sun struggles with the shadows of the foreground, creating a fleeting effect of marble light. The Renaissance saw the emergence of the sfumato technique, traditionally attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which consisted of the degradation of light tones to blur the contours and thus give a sense of remoteness. This technique was intended to give greater verisimilitude to the pictorial representation, by creating effects similar to those of human vision in environments with a wide perspective. The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke. It is also called \"aerial perspective\", since its results resemble the vision in a natural environment determined by atmospheric and environmental effects. This technique was used, in addition to Leonardo, by Dürer, Giorgione and Bernardino Luini, and later by Velázquez and other Baroque painters.. Leonardo was essentially concerned with perception, the observation of nature. He sought life in painting, which he found in color, in the light of chromaticism. In his Treatise on Painting (1540) he stated that painting is the sum of light and darkness (chiaroscuro), which gives movement, life: according to Leonardo, darkness is the body and light is the spirit, and the mixture of both is life. In his treatise he established that \"painting is a composition of light and shadows, combined with the various qualities of all the simple and compound colors\". He also distinguished between illumination (lume) and brilliance (lustro), and warned that \"opaque bodies with hard and rough surface never generate luster in any illuminated part\".. The Florentine polymath included light among the main components of painting and pointed it out as an element that articulates pictorial representation and conditions the spatial structure and the volume and chromaticism of objects and figures. He was also concerned with the study of shadows and their effects, which he analyzed together with light in his treatise. He also distinguished between shadow (ombra) and darkness (tenebre), the former being an oscillation between light and darkness. He also studied nocturnal painting, for which he recommended the presence of fire as a means of illumination, and he wrote down the different necessary gradations of light and color according to the distance from the light source. Leonardo was one of the first artists to be concerned with the degree of illumination of the painter\\'s studio, suggesting that for nudes or carnations the studio should have uncovered lights and red walls, while for portraits the walls should be black and the light diffused by a canopy.. Leonardo\\'s subtle chiaroscuro effects are perceived in his female portraits, in which the shadows fall on the faces as if submerging them in a subtle and mysterious atmosphere. In these works he advocated intermediate lights, stating that \"the contours and figures of dark bodies are poorly distinguished in the dark as well as in the light, but in the intermediate zones between light and shadow they are better perceived\". Likewise, on color he wrote that \"colors placed in shadows will participate to a greater or lesser degree in their natural beauty according as they are placed in greater or lesser darkness. But if the colors are placed in a luminous space, then they will possess a beauty all the greater the more splendorous the luminosity\".. Look at the light and consider its beauty. Blink and look at it again: what you now see of the light was not there before and what was there before no longer exists.. The other great name of the early Cinquecento was Raphael, a serene and balanced artist whose work shows a certain idealism framed in a realistic technique of great virtuoso execution. According to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, Raphael \"has given enchanting, loving and sweet light, so that his figures appear beautiful, pleasing and intricate in their contours, and endowed with such relief that they seem to move.\" Some of his lighting solutions were quite innovative, with resources halfway between Leonardo and Caravaggio, as seen in The Transfiguration (1517-1520, Vatican Museums, Vatican City), in which he divides the image into two halves, the heavenly and the earthly, each with different pictorial resources. In the Liberation of Saint Peter (1514, Vatican Museums, Vatican City) he painted a nocturnal scene in which the light radiating from the angel in the center stands out, giving a sensation of depth, while at the same time it is reflected in the breastplates of the guards, creating intense luminous effects. This was perhaps the first work to include artificial lighting with a naturalistic sense: the light radiating from the angel influences the illumination of the surrounding objects, while diluting the distant forms.. Outside Italy, Albrecht Dürer was especially concerned with light in his watercolor landscapes, treated with an almost topographical detail, in which he shows a special delicacy in the capture of light, with poetic effects that prelude the sentimental landscape of Romanticism. Albrecht Altdorfer showed a surprising use of light in The Battle of Alexander at Issos (1529, Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the appearance of the sun among the clouds produces a supernatural refulgence, effects of bubbling lights that also precede Romanticism. Matthias Grünewald was a solitary and melancholic artist, whose original work reflects a certain mysticism in the treatment of religious themes, with an emotive and expressionist style, still with medieval roots. His main work was the altar of Isenheim (1512-1516, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar), in which the refulgent halo in which he places his Risen Christ stands out. Between Gothic and Renaissance is the unclassifiable work of Bosch, a Flemish artist gifted with a great imagination, author of dreamlike images that continue to surprise for their fantasy and originality. In his works — and especially in his landscape backgrounds — there is a great skill in the use of light in different temporal and environmental circumstances, but he also knew how to recreate in his infernal scenes fantastic effects of flames and fires, as well as supernatural lights and other original effects, especially in works such as The Last Judgment (c. 1486-1510, Groenige Museum, Bruges), Visions of the Beyond (c. 1490, Doge\\'s Palace, Venice), The Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1500-1505, Museo del Prado, Madrid), The Hay Chariot (c. 1500-1502, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or The Temptations of Saint Anthony (c. 1501, Museum of Fine Arts, Lisbon). Bosch had a predilection for the effects of light generated by fire, by the glow of flames, which gave rise to a new series of paintings in which the effects of violent and fantastic lights originated by fire stood out, as is denoted in a work by an anonymous artist linked to the workshop of Lucas van Leyden, Lot and his daughters (c. 1530, Musée du Louvre, Paris), or in some works by Joachim Patinir, such as Charon crossing the Styx Lagoon (c. 1520-1524, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or Landscape with the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (c. 1520, Boymans Van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam). These effects also influenced Giorgione, as well as some Mannerist painters such as Lorenzo Lotto, Dosso Dossi and Domenico Beccafumi. Mannerism. At the end of the High Renaissance, in the middle of the 16th century, Mannerism followed, a movement that abandoned nature as a source of inspiration to seek a more emotional and expressive tone, in which the artist\\'s subjective interpretation of the work of art became more important, with a taste for sinuous and stylized form, with deformation of reality, distorted perspectives and gimmicky atmospheres. In this style light was used in a gimmicky way, with an unreal treatment, looking for a colored light of different origins, both a cold moonlight and a warm firelight. Mannerism broke with the full Renaissance light by introducing night scenes with intense chromatic interplay between light and shadow and a dynamic rhythm far from Renaissance harmony. Mannerist light, in contrast to Renaissance classicism, took on a more expressive function, with a natural origin but an unreal treatment, a disarticulating factor of the classicist balance, as seen in the work of Pontormo, Rosso or Beccafumi.. In Mannerism, the Renaissance optical scheme of light and shadow was broken by suppressing the visual relationship between the light source and the illuminated parts of the painting, as well as in the intermediate steps of gradation. The result was strong contrasts of color and chiaroscuro, and an artificial and refulgent aspect of the illuminated parts, independent of the light source.Between Renaissance classicism and Mannerism lies the work of Michelangelo, one of the most renowned artists of universal stature. His use of light was generally with plastic criteria, but sometimes he used it as a dramatic resource, especially in his frescoes in the Pauline Chapel: Crucifixion of Saint Peter and Conversion of Saint Paul (1549). Placed on opposite walls, the artist valued the entry of natural light into the chapel, which illuminated one wall and left the other in semi-darkness: in the darkest part he placed the Crucifixion, a subject more suitable for the absence of light, which emphasizes the tragedy of the scene, intensified in its symbolic aspect by the fading light of dusk that is perceived on the horizon; instead, the Conversion receives natural light, but at the same time the pictorial composition has more luminosity, especially for the powerful ray of light that comes from the hand of Christ and is projected on the figure of Saul, who thanks to this divine intervention is converted to Christianity.. Another reference of Mannerism was Correggio, the first artist —according to Vasari — to apply a dark tone in contrast to light to produce effects of depth, while masterfully developing the Leonardoesque sfumato through diffuse lights and gradients. In his work The Nativity (1522, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden) he was the first to show the birth of Jesus as a \"miracle of light\", an assimilation that would become habitual from then on. In The Assumption of the Virgin (1526-1530), painted on the dome of the cathedral of Parma, he created an illusionistic effect with figures seen from below (sotto in sù) that would be the forerunner of Baroque optical illusionism; in this work the subtle nuances of his flesh tones stand out, as well as the luminous break of glory of its upper part.. Jacopo Pontormo, a disciple of Leonardo, developed a strongly emotional, dynamic style with unreal effects of space and scale, in which a great mastery of color and light can be glimpsed, applied by color stains, especially red. Domenico Beccafumi stood out for his colorism, fantasy and unusual light effects, as in The Birth of the Virgin (1543, Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena). Rosso Fiorentino also developed an unusual coloring and fanciful play of light and shadow, as in his Descent of Christ (1521, Pinacoteca Comunale, Volterra). Luca Cambiasso showed a great interest in nocturnal illumination, which is why he is considered a forerunner of tenebrism. Bernardino Luini, a disciple of Leonardo, showed a Leonardoesque treatment of light in the Madonna of the Rosebush (c. 1525-1530, Pinacoteca di Brera).. Alongside this more whimsical mannerism, a school of a more serene style emerged in Venice that stood out for its treatment of light, which subordinated plastic form to luminous values, as can be seen in the work of Giorgione, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. In this school, light and color were fused, and Renaissance linear perspective was replaced by aerial perspective, the use of which would culminate in the Baroque. The technique used by these Venetian painters is called \"tonalism\": it consisted in the superimposition of glazes to form the image through the modulation of color and light, which are harmonized through relations of tone modulating them in a space of plausible appearance. The color assumes the function of light and shadow, and it is the chromatic relationships that create the effects of volume. In this modality, the chromatic tone depends on the intensity of light and shadow (the color value). Giorgione brought the Leonardesque influence to Venice. He was an original artist, one of the first to specialize in cabinet paintings for private collectors, and the first to subordinate the subject of the work to the evocation of moods. Vasari considered him, together with Leonardo, one of the founders of \"modern painting\". A great innovator, he reformulated landscape painting both in composition and iconography, with images conceived in depth with a careful modulation of chromatic and light values, as is evident in one of his masterpieces, The Tempest (1508, Gallerie dell\\'Accademia, Venice).Titian was a virtuoso in the recreation of vibrant atmospheres with subtle shades of light achieved with infinite variations obtained after a meticulous study of reality and a skillful handling of the brushes that demonstrated a great technical mastery. In his Pentecost (1546, Santa Maria della Salute, Venice) he made rays of light emanate from the dove representing the Holy Spirit, ending in tongues of fire on the heads of the Virgin and the apostles, with surprising light effects that were innovative for his time. This research gradually evolved into increasingly dramatic effects, giving more emphasis to artificial lighting, as seen in The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence (1558, Jesuit Church, Venice), where he combines the light of the torches and the fire of the grill where the saint is martyred with the supernatural effect of a powerful flash of divine light in the sky that is projected on the figure of the saint. This experimentation with light influenced the work of artists such as Veronese, Tintoretto, Jacopo Bassano and El Greco.Tintoretto liked to paint enclosed in his studio with the windows closed by the light of candles and torches, which is why his paintings are often called di notte e di fuoco (\"by night and fire\"). In his works, of deep atmospheres, with thin and vertical figures, the violent effects of artificial lights stand out, with strong chiaroscuro and phosphorescent effects. These luminous effects were adopted by other members of the Venetian school such as the Bassano (Jacopo, Leandro, and Francesco), as well as by the so-called \"Lombard illuminists\" (Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo, Moretto da Brescia), while influencing El Greco and Baroque tenebrism.. Another artist framed in the painting di notte e di fuoco was Jacopo Bassano, whose indirect incidence lights influenced Baroque naturalism. In works such as Christ in the House of Mary, Martha and Lazarus (c. 1577, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston), he combined natural and artificial lights with striking lighting effects. For his part, Paolo Veronese was heir to the luminism of Giovanni Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio, in scenes of Palladian architecture with dense morning lights, golden and warm, without prominent shadows, emphasizing the brightness of fabrics and jewels. In Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto (1571) he divided the scene into two halves, the battle below and the Virgin with the saints who ask for her favor for the battle at the top, where angels are placed, throwing lightning bolts towards the battle, creating spectacular lighting effects.. Outside Italy it is worth mentioning the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, author of costumist scenes and landscapes that denote a great sensitivity towards nature. In some of his works the influence of Hieronymous Bosch can be seen in his fire lights and fantastic effects, as in The Triumph of Death (c. 1562, Museo del Prado, Madrid). In some of his landscapes he added the sun as a direct source of luminosity, such as the yellow sun of The Flemish Proverbs (1559, Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the red winter sun of The Census in Bethlehem (1556, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) or the evening sun of Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (c. 1558, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels).El Greco worked in Spain during this period, a singular painter who developed an individual style, marked by the influence of the Venetian school, the city where he lived for a time, as well as Michelangelo, from whom he took his conception of the human figure. In El Greco\\'s work, light always prevails over shadows, as a clear symbolism of the preeminence of faith over unbelief. In one of his first works from Toledo, the Expolio for the sacristy of the cathedral of Toledo (1577), a zenithal light illuminates the figure of Jesus, focusing on his face, which becomes the focus of light in the painting. In the Trinity of the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo (1577-1580) he introduced a dazzling Gloria light of an intense golden yellow. In The Martyrdom of Saint Maurice (1580-1582, Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial) he created two areas of differentiated light: the natural light that surrounds the earthly characters and that of the breaking of the glory in the sky, furrowed with angels. Among his last works stands out The Adoration of the Shepherds (1612-1613, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where the focus of light is the Child Jesus, who radiates his luminosity around producing phosphorescent effects of strong chromatism and luminosity. El Greco\\'s illumination evolved from the light coming from a specific point —or in a diffuse way — of the Venetian school to a light rooted in Byzantine art, in which the figures are illuminated without a specific light source or even a diffuse light. It is an unnatural light, which can come from multiple sources or none at all, an arbitrary and unequal light that produces hallucinatory effects. El Greco had a plastic conception of light: his execution went from dark to light tones, finally applying touches of white that created shimmering effects. The refulgent aspect of his works was achieved through glazes, while the whites were finished with almost dry applications. His light is mystical, subjective, almost spectral in appearance, with a taste for shimmering gleams and incandescent reflections. Barroco. In the 17th century, the Baroque emerged, a more refined and ornamented style, with the survival of a certain classicist rationalism but with more dynamic and dramatic forms, with a taste for the surprising and the anecdotal, for optical illusions and the effect blows. Baroque painting had a marked geographical differentiating accent, since its development took place in different countries, in various national schools, each with a distinctive stamp. However, there is a common influence coming again from Italy, where two opposing trends emerged: naturalism (also called caravagism), based on the imitation of natural reality, with a certain taste for chiaroscuro — the so-called tenebrism — and classicism, which is just as realistic but with a more intellectual and idealized concept of reality. Later, in the so-called \"full baroque\" (second half of the 17th and early 18th centuries), painting evolved to a more decorative style, with a predominance of mural painting and a certain predilection for optical effects (trompe-l\\'œil) and luxurious and exuberant scenographies.. During this period, many scientific studies on light were carried out (Johannes Kepler, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, Robert Boyle), which influenced its pictorial representation. Newton proved that color comes from the spectrum of white light and designed the first chromatic circle showing the relationships between colors. In this period the maximum degree of perfection was reached in the pictorial representation of light and the tactile form was diluted in favor of a greater visual impression, achieved by giving greater importance to light, losing the form the accuracy of its contours. In the Baroque, light was studied for the first time as a system of composition, articulating it as a regulating element of the painting: light fulfills several functions, such as symbolic, modeling and illumination, and begins to be directed as an emphatic element, selective of the part of the painting to be highlighted, so that artificial light becomes more important, which can be manipulated at the free will of the artist. Sacred light (nimbus, haloes) was abandoned and natural light was used exclusively, even as a symbolic element. On the other hand, the light of different times of the day (morning, twilight) began to be distinguished. Illumination was conceived as a luminous unit, as opposed to the multiple sources of Renaissance light; in the Baroque there may be several sources, but they are circumscribed to a global and unitary sense of the work.In the Baroque, the nocturne genre became fashionable, which implies a special difficulty in terms of the representation of light, due to the absence of daylight, so that on numerous occasions it was necessary to resort to chiaroscuro and lighting effects from artificial light, while the natural light should come from the moon or the stars. For artificial light, bonfires, candles, lanterns, lanterns, candles, fireworks or similar elements were used. These light sources could be direct or indirect, they could appear in the painting or illuminate the scene from outside. Naturalism. Chiaroscuro resurfaced during the Baroque, especially in the Counter-Reformation, as a method of focusing the viewer\\'s vision on the primordial parts of religious paintings, which were emphasized as didactic elements, as opposed to the Renaissance \"pictorial decor\". An exacerbated variant of chiaroscuro was tenebrism, a technique based on strong contrasts of light and shadow, with a violent type of lighting, generally artificial, which gives greater prominence to the illuminated areas, on which a powerful focus of directed light is placed. These effects have a strong dramatism, which emphasizes the scenes represented, generally of religious type, although they also abound in mythological scenes, still lifes or vanitas. One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and José de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo\\'s chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist\\'s power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Musée du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action.. Artemisia Gentileschi trained with her father, Orazio Gentileschi, coinciding with the years when Caravaggio lived in Rome, whose work she could appreciate in San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria del Popolo. His work was channeled in the tenebrist naturalism, assuming its most characteristic features: expressive use of light and chiaroscuro, dramatism of the scenes and figures of round anatomy. His most famous work is Judith beheading Holofernes (two versions: 1612-1613, Museo Capodimonte, Naples; and 1620, Uffizi, Florence), where the light focuses on Judith, her maid and the Assyrian general, against a complete darkness, emphasizing the drama of the scene. In the 1630s, established in Naples, his style adopted a more classicist component, without completely abandoning naturalism, with more diaphanous spaces and clearer and sharper atmospheres, although chiaroscuro remained an essential part of the composition, as a means to create space, give volume and expressiveness to the image. One of his best compositions due to the complexity of its lighting is The Birth of Saint John the Baptist (1630, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where he mixes natural and artificial light: the light from the portal in the upper right part of the painting softens the light inside the room, in a \"subtle transition of light values\" — according to Roberto Longhi — that would later become common in Dutch painting. Adam Elsheimer was noted for his light studies of landscape painting, with an interest in dawn and dusk lights, as well as night lighting and atmospheric effects such as mists and fogs. His light was strange and intense, with an enamel-like appearance typical of German painting, in a tradition ranging from Lukas Moser to Albrecht Altdorfer. His most famous painting is Flight into Egypt (1609, Alte Pinakothek, Munich), a night scene that is considered the first moonlit landscape; four sources of light are visible in this work: the shepherds\\' bonfire, the torch carried by Saint Joseph, the moon and its reflection in the water; the Milky Way can also be perceived, whose representation can also be considered as the first one done in a naturalistic way.. Georges de La Tour was a magnificent interpreter of artificial light, generally lamp or candle lights, with a visible and precise focus, which he used to place inside the image, emphasizing its dramatic aspect. Sometimes, in order not to dazzle, the characters placed their hands in front of the candle, creating translucent effects on the skin, which acquired a reddish tone, of great realism and that proved his virtuosity in capturing reality. While his early works show the influence of Italian Caravaggism, from his stay in Paris between 1636 and 1643 he came closer to Dutch Caravaggism, more prone to the direct inclusion of the light source on the canvas. He thus began his most tenebrist period, with scenes of strong half-light where the light, generally from a candle, illuminates with greater or lesser intensity certain areas of the painting. In general, two types of composition can be distinguished: the fully visible light source (Job with his wife, Musée Départemental des Vosges, Épinal; Woman spurring herself, Musée Historique Lorrain, Nancy; Madeleine Terff, Musée du Louvre, Paris) or the light blocked by an object or character, creating a backlit illumination (Madeleine Fabius, Fabius collection, Paris; Angel appearing to Saint Joseph, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nantes; The Adoration of the Shepherds, Musée du Louvre, Paris). In his later works he reduces the characters to schematic figures of geometric appearance, like mannequins, to fully recreate the effects of light on masses and surfaces (The Repentance of Saint Peter, Museum of Art, Cleveland; The Newborn, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rennes; Saint Sebastian cured by Saint Irene, parish church of Broglie).. Despite its plausible appearance, La Tour\\'s lighting is not fully naturalistic, but is sifted by the artist\\'s will; at all times he prints the desired amount of light and shadow to recreate the desired effect; in general, it is a serene and diffuse lighting, which brings out the volume without excessive drama. The light serves to unite the figures, to highlight the part of the painting that best suits the plot of the work, it is a timeless light of a poetic, transcendent character; it is just the right light necessary to provide credibility, but it serves a more symbolic than realistic purpose. It is an unreal light, since no candle generates such a serene and diffuse light, a conceptual and stylistic light, which serves only the compositional intention of the painter.Another French Caravaggist was Trophime Bigot, nicknamed Maître à la chandelle (Master of the candle) for his scenes of artificial light, in which he showed great expertise in the technique of chiaroscuro. The Valencian artist José de Ribera (nicknamed lo Spagnoletto), who lived in Naples, fully assumed the Caravaggesque light, with an anti-idealist style of pasty brushstrokes and dynamic effects of movement. Ribera assumed the tenebrist illumination in a personal way, sifted by other influences, such as Venetian coloring or the compositional rigor of Bolognese classicism. In his early work he used the violent contrasts of light and shadow characteristic of tenebrism, but from the 1630s he evolved to a greater chromaticism and clearer and more diaphanous backgrounds. In contrast to the flat painting of Caravaggio, Ribera used a dense paste that gave more volume and emphasized the brightness. One of his best works, Sileno ebrio (1626, Museum of Capodimonte, Naples) stands out for the flashes of light that illuminate the various characters, with special emphasis on the naked body of the Sileno, illuminated by a flat light of morbid appearance.. In addition to Ribera, in Spain, Caravaggism had the figure of Juan Bautista Maíno, a Dominican friar who was drawing teacher of Philip IV, resident in Rome between 1598 and 1612, where he was a disciple of Annibale Carracci; his work stands out for its colorism and luminosity, as in The Adoration of the Shepherds (1611-1613, Museo del Prado, Madrid). Also noteworthy is the work of the still life painters Juan Sánchez Cotán and Juan van der Hamen. In general, Spanish naturalism treated light with a sense close to Caravaggism, but with a certain sensuality coming from the Venetian school and a detailing with Flemish roots. Francisco de Zurbarán developed a somewhat sweetened tenebrism, although one of his best works, San Hugo in the refectory of the Carthusian monks (c. 1630, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) stands out for the presence of white color, with a subtle play of light and shadow that stands out for the multiplicity of intensities applied to each figure and object.In Venice, Baroque painting did not produce such exceptional figures as in the Renaissance and Mannerism, but in the work of artists such as Domenico Fetti, Johann Liss, and Bernardo Strozzi one can perceive the vibrant luminism and the enveloping atmospheres so characteristic of Venetian painting.. The Caravaggist novelties had a special echo in Holland, where the so-called Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged, a series of painters who assumed the description of reality and the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio as pictorial principles, on which they developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and the search for new compositional schemes, resulting in a painting that stands out for its optical values. Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti (\"Gerard of the Nights\"). In works such as Christ before the High Priest (1617), Nativity (1622), The Prodigal Son (1623) or The Procuress (1625), he showed great mastery in the use of artificial light, generally from candles, with one or two light sources that illuminated the scene unevenly, highlighting the most significant parts of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness. Of his Christ on the Column, Joachim von Sandrart said: \"the brightness of the candles and lights illuminates everything with a naturalness that resembles life so closely that no art has ever reached such heights\".. One of the greatest exponents of the symbolic use of light was Rembrandt, an original artist with a strong personal stamp, with a style close to tenebrism but more diffused, without the marked contrasts between light and shadow typical of the Caravaggists, but a more subtle and diffuse penumbra. According to Giovanni Arpino, Rembrandt \"invented light, not as heat, but as value. He invented light not to illuminate, but to make his world unapproachable\". In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light. Rembrandtian light is a reflection of an external force, which affects the objects causing them to radiate energy, like the retransmission of a message. Although he starts from tenebrism, his contrasts of light and shadow are not as sharp as those of Caravaggio, but he likes more a kind of golden shadows that give a mysterious air to his paintings. In Rembrandt, light was something structural, integrated in form, color and space, in such a way that it dematerializes bodies and plays with the texture of objects. It is a light that is not subject to the laws of physics, which he generally concentrates in one area of the painting, creating a glowing luminosity. In his work, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light. According to Wolfgang Schöne, in Rembrandt light and darkness are actually two types of light, one bright and the other dark. He used to use a canvas as a reflecting or diffusing screen, which he regulated as he wished to obtain the desired illumination in each scene. His concern for light led him not only to his pictorial study, but also to establish the correct placement of his paintings for optimal visualization; thus, in 1639 he advised Constantijn Huygens on the placement of his painting Samson blinded by the Philistines: \"hang this painting where there is strong light, so that it can be seen from a certain distance, and thus it will have the best effect\". Rembrandt also masterfully captured light in his etchings, such as The Hundred Florins and The Three Crosses, in which light is almost the protagonist of the scene.. Rembrandt picked up the luminous tradition of the Venetian school, as did his compatriot Johannes Vermeer, although while the former stands out for his fantastic effects of light, the latter develops in his work a luminosity of great quality in the local tones. Vermeer imprinted his works — generally everyday scenes in interior spaces — with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres. He used a technique called pointillé, a series of dots of pigment with which he enhanced the objects, on which he often applied a luminosity that made the surfaces reflect the light in a special way. Vermeer\\'s light softens the contours without losing the solidity of the forms, in a combination of softness and precision that few other artists have achieved.. Nicknamed the \"painter of light\", Vermeer masterfully synthesized light and color, he knew how to capture the color of light like no one else. In his works, light is itself a color, while shadow is inextricably linked to light. Vermeer\\'s light is always natural, he does not like artificial light, and generally has a tone close to lemon yellow, which together with the dull blue and light gray were the main colors of his palette. It is the light that forms the figures and objects, and in conjunction with the color is what fixes the forms. As for the shadows, they are interspersed in the light, reversing the contrast: instead of fitting the luminous part of the painting into the shadows, it is the shadows that are cut out of the luminous space. Contrary to the practice of chiaroscuro, in which the form is progressively lost in the half-light, Vermeer placed a foreground of dark color to increase the tonal intensity, which reaches its zenith in the middle light; from here he dissolves the color towards white, instead of towards black as was done in chiaroscuro. In Vermeer\\'s work, the painting is an organized structure through which light circulates, is absorbed and diffused by the objects that appear on the scene. He builds the forms thanks to the harmony between light and color, which is saturated, with a predominance of pure colors and cold tones. The light gives visual existence to the space, which in turn receives and diffuses it.. In Vermeer, light is never artificial: it is precise and normal like that of nature, and of an accuracy capable of satisfying the most scrupulous physicist. [...] This accuracy of light in Vermeer is due to the harmony of the coloring.. Other prominent Dutch painters were Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens. The former had a Caravaggist phase between 1625 and 1630, with a clear chromaticism and diffuse luminosity (The Merry Drinker, 1627-1628, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Malle Babbe, 1629-1630, Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), to evolve later to a more sober, dark and monochromatic style. Jordaens had a style characterized by a bright and fantastic coloring, with strong contrasts of light and shadow and a technique of dense impasto. Between 1625 and 1630 he had a period in which he deepened the luminous values of his images, in works such as The Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia (1628, Church of Saint Augustine, Antwerp) or The Fecundity of the Earth (1630, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). One should also mention Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou who worked not only in his native country but also in England and Germany. An excellent portraitist, in many of his works he used artificial candlelight or candle light, influenced by Rembrandt, as in Portrait of William III (1692-1697, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), Portrait of James Stuart, Duke of Lennox and Richmond (1692-1696, Leiden Collection, New York), Young Man and Woman Studying a Statue of Venus by Lamplight (c. 1690, Leiden Collection, New York) or Old Man Reading by Candlelight (c. 1700, Museo del Prado, Madrid).. A genre that flourished in Holland in an exceptional way in this century was landscape painting, which, in line with the mannerist landscape painting of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Joos de Momper, developed a new sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. Jan van Goyen was its first representative, followed by artists such as Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle and Adriaen van de Velde. Salomon van Ruysdael sought atmospheric capture, which he treated by tonalities, studying the light of different times of the day. His nephew Jacob van Ruysdael was endowed with a great sensitivity for natural vision, and his depressive character led him to elaborate images of great expressiveness, where the play of light and shadow accentuated the drama of the scene. His light is not the saturating and static light of the Renaissance, but a light in movement, perceptible in the effects of light and shadow in the clouds and their reflections in the plains, a light that led John Constable to formulate one of his lessons on art: \"remember that light and shadow never stand still\". His assistant was Meindert Hobbema, from whom he differed in his chromatic contrasts and lively light effects, which reveal a certain nervousness of stroke. Aelbert Cuyp used a much lighter palette than his compatriots, with a warmer and more golden light, probably influenced by Jan Both\\'s \"Italianate landscape\". He stood out for his atmospheric effects, for the detail of the light reflections on objects or landscape elements, for the use of elongated shadows and for the use of the sun\\'s rays diagonally and backlit, in line with the stylistic novelties produced in Italy, especially around the figure of Claudius of Lorraine. Another genre that flourished in Holland was the still life. One of its best representatives was Willem Kalf, author of still lifes of great precision in detail, which combined flowers, fruits and other foods with various objects generally of luxury, such as vases, Turkish carpets and bowls of Chinese porcelain, which emphasize their play of light and shadow and the bright reflections in the metallic and crystalline surfaces. Classicism and full Baroque. Classicism emerged in Bologna, around the so-called Bolognese School, initiated by the brothers Annibale and Agostino Carracci. This trend was a reaction against mannerism, which sought an idealized representation of nature, representing it not as it is, but as it should be. It pursued the ideal beauty as its sole objective, for which it was inspired by classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance art. This ideal found an ideal subject of representation in the landscape, as well as in historical and mythological themes. In addition to the Carracci brothers, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Guercino and Giovanni Lanfranco stood out.. In the classicist trend, the use of light is paramount in the composition of the painting, although with slight nuances depending on the artist: from the Incamminati and the Academy of Bologna (Carracci brothers), Italian classicism split into several currents: one moved more towards decorativism, with the use of light tones and shiny surfaces, where the lighting is articulated in large luminous spaces (Guido Reni, Lanfranco, Guercino); another specialized in landscape painting and, starting from the Carracci influence — mainly the frescoes of Palazzo Aldobrandini — developed along two parallel lines: the first focused more on classical-style composition, with a certain scenographic character in the arrangement of landscapes and figures (Poussin, Domenichino); the other is represented by Claudio da Lorena, with a more lyrical component and greater concern for the representation of light, not only as a plastic factor but as an agglutinating element of a harmonious conception of the work.Claudio de Lorena was one of the baroque painters who best knew how to represent light in his works, to which he gave a primordial importance at the time of conceiving the painting: the light composition served firstly as a plastic factor, being the basis with which he organized the composition, with which he created space and time, with which he articulated the figures, the architectures, the elements of nature; secondly, it was an aesthetic factor, highlighting light as the main sensitive element, as the medium that attracts and envelops the viewer and leads him to a dream world, a world of ideal perfection recreated by the atmosphere of total serenity and placidity that Claudio created with his light. Lorena\\'s light was direct and natural, coming from the sun, which he placed in the middle of the scene, in sunrises or sunsets that gently illuminated all parts of the painting, sometimes placing in certain areas intense contrasts of light and shadow, or backlighting that impacted on a certain element to emphasize it. The artist from Lorraine emphasized color and light over the material description of the elements, which precedes to a great extent the luminous investigations of Impressionism.. Lorraine\\'s capture of light is unparalleled by any of his contemporaries: in the landscapes of Rembrandt or Ruysdael the light has more dramatic effects, piercing the clouds or flowing in oblique or horizontal rays, but in a directed manner, the source of which can be easily located. On the other hand, Claudio\\'s light is serene, diffuse; unlike the artists of his time, he gives it greater relevance if it is necessary to opt for a certain stylistic solution. On numerous occasions he uses the horizon line as a vanishing point, arranging in that place a focus of clarity that attracts the viewer, because that almost blinding luminosity acts as a focalizing element that brings the background closer to the foreground. The light is diffused from the background of the painting and, as it expands, it is enough by itself to create a sensation of depth, blurring the contours and degrading the colors to create the space of the painting. Lorena prefers the serene and placid light of the sun, direct or indirect, but always through a soft and uniform illumination, avoiding sensational effects such as moonlight, rainbows or storms, which were nevertheless used by other landscape painters of her time. His basic reference in the use of light is Elsheimer, but he differs from him in the choice of light sources and times represented: the German artist preferred exceptional light effects, nocturnal environments, moonlight or twilight; on the other hand, Claudio prefers more natural environments, a limpid light of dawn or the refulgence of a warm sunset.. On the other hand, the Flemish Peter Paul Rubens represents serenity in the face of Tenebrist dramatism. In his work, mythological themes stand out —although he was also the author of numerous religious works — in which he shows an aesthetic ideal of feminine beauty of robust figures and carnal sensuality, with a certain feeling of natural purity that gives his canvases a kind of dreamy candor, an optimistic and integrating vision of man\\'s relationship with nature. He was a master in finding the precise tonality for the flesh tones of the skin, as well as its different textures and the multiple variants of the effects of brightness and the reflections of light on the flesh. Rubens had an in-depth knowledge of the different techniques and traditions related to light, and so he was able to assimilate both Mannerist iridescent light and Tenebrist focal light, internal and external light, homogeneous and dispersed light. In his work, light serves as an organizing element of the composition, in such a way that it agglutinates all the figures and objects in a unitary mass of the same light intensity, with different compositional systems, either with central or diagonal illumination or combining a light in the foreground with another in the background. In his beginnings he was influenced by the Caravaggist chiaroscuro, but from 1615 he sought a greater luminosity based on the tradition of Flemish painting, so he accentuated the light tones and marked the contours more. His images stand out for their sinuous movement, with atmospheres built with powerful lights that helped to organize the development of the action, combining the Flemish tradition with the Venetian coloring that he learned in his travels to Italy. Perhaps where he experimented most in the use of light was in his landscapes, most of them painted in his old age, whose use of color and light with agile and vibrant brushstrokes influenced Velázquez and other painters of his time, such as Jordaens and Van Dyck, and artists of later periods such as Jean-Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Eugène Delacroix, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Diego Velázquez was undoubtedly the most brilliant artist of his time in Spain, and one of the most internationally renowned. In the evolution of his style we can perceive a profound study of pictorial illumination, of the effects of light both on objects and on the environment, with which he reaches heights of great realism in the representation of his scenes, which however is not exempt from an air of classical idealization, which shows a clear intellectual background that for the artist was a vindication of the painter\\'s craft as a creative and elevated activity. Velázquez was the architect of a space-light in which the atmosphere is a diaphanous matter full of light, which is freely distributed throughout a continuous space, without divisions of planes, in such a way that the light permeates the backgrounds, which acquire vitality and are as highlighted as the foreground. It is a world of instantaneous capture, alien to tangible reality, in which the light generates a dynamic effect that dilutes the contours, which together with the vibratory effect of the changing planes of light produces a sensation of movement. He usually alternated zones of light and shadow, creating a parallel stratification of space. Sometimes he even atomized the areas of light and shadow into small corpuscles, which was a precedent for impressionism.In his youth he was influenced by Caravaggio, to evolve later to a more diaphanous light, as shown in his two paintings of the Villa Medici, in which light filters through the trees. Throughout his career he achieved a great mastery in capturing a type of light of atmospheric origin, of the irradiation of light and chromatic vibration, with a fluid technique that pointed to the forms rather than defining them, thus achieving a dematerialized but truthful vision of reality, a reality that transcends matter and is framed in the world of ideas. After the smoothly executed tenebrism and precise drawing of his first period in Seville (Vieja friendo huevos, 1618, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh; El aguador de Sevilla, 1620, Apsley House, London), his arrival at the Madrid court marked a stylistic change influenced by Rubens and the Venetian school — whose work he was able to study in the royal collections — with looser brushstrokes and soft volumes, while maintaining a realistic tone derived from his youthful period. Finally, after his trip to Italy between 1629 and 1631, he reached his definitive style, in which he synthesized the multiple influences received, with a fluid technique of pasty brushstrokes and great chromatic richness, as can be seen in La fragua de Vulcano (1631, Museo del Prado, Madrid). The Surrender of Breda (1635, Museo del Prado, Madrid) was a first milestone in his mastery of atmospheric light, where color and luminosity achieve an accentuated protagonism. In works such as Pablo de Valladolid (1633, Museo del Prado, Madrid), he managed to define the space without any geometric reference, only with lights and shadows. The Sevillian artist was a master at recreating the atmosphere of enclosed spaces, as shown in Las Meninas (1656, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where he placed several spotlights: the light that enters through the window and illuminates the figures of the Infanta and her ladies-in-waiting, the light from the rear window that shines around the lamp hanger and the light that enters through the door in the background. In this work he constructed a plausible space by defining or diluting the forms according to the use of light and the nuance of color, in a display of technical virtuosity that has led to the consideration of the canvas as one of the masterpieces in the history of painting. In a similar way, he succeeded in structuring space and forms by means of light planes in Las hilanderas (1657, Museo del Prado, Madrid).. As it invades the room, the light is diffused irregularly over the various surfaces. The mirror shimmers with tremulous, silvery light and offers a clearer image than that of the large, dull canvases hanging above it. A sliver of light escapes from the half-closed window that opens in the last section, forming a well of luminosity around the lamp hook at the back of the ceiling. And then, in the background plane, a new light source is included that illuminates the figure in the doorway; from it emerges, thin as a beam, a ray that swiftly crosses the floor of the room under the mirror. The illusion of space and volume thus becomes irresistibly palpable.. Another outstanding Spanish Baroque painter was Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, one of whose favorite themes was the Immaculate Conception, of which he produced several versions, generally with the figure of the Virgin within an atmosphere of golden light symbolizing divinity. He generally used translucent colors applied in thin layers, with an almost watercolor appearance, a procedure that denotes the influence of Venetian painting. After a youthful period of tenebrist influence, in his mature work he rejected chiaroscuro dramatism and developed a serene luminosity that was shown in all its splendor in his characteristic breaks of glory, of rich chromaticism and soft luminosity.The last period of this style was the so-called \"full Baroque\" (second half of the 17th and early 18th centuries), a decorative style in which the illusionist, theatrical and scenographic character of Baroque painting was intensified, with a predominance of mural painting — especially on ceilings — in which Pietro da Cortona, Andrea Pozzo, Giovanni Battista Gaulli (il Baciccio), Luca Giordano and Charles Le Brun stood out. In works such as the ceiling of the church of the Gesù, by Gaulli, or the Palazzo Barberini, in Cortona, is \"where the ability to combine extreme light and darkness in a painting was pushed to the limit,\" according to John Gage, to which he adds that \"the Baroque decorator not only introduced into painting the contrasts between extreme darkness and extreme light, but also a careful gradation between the two.\" Andrea Pozzo\\'s Glory of Saint Ignatius of Loyola (1691-1694), on the ceiling of the church of Saint Ignatius in Rome, a scene full of heavenly light in which Christ sends a ray of light into the heart of the saint, who in turn deflects it into four beams of light directed towards the four continents, is noteworthy. In Spain, Francisco de Herrera el Mozo, Juan Carreño de Miranda, Claudio Coello and Francisco Ricci were exponents of this style. From Caravaggio to the last painting by Velázquez — which is the starting point — the history of painting is the great journey to the land of light, of the effective light that illuminates the world in which we live. 18th Century. The 18th century was nicknamed the \"Age of Enlightenment\", as it was the period in which the Enlightenment emerged, a philosophical movement that defended reason and science against religious dogmatism. Art oscillated between the late Baroque exuberance of Rococo and neoclassicist sobriety, between artifice and naturalism. A certain autonomy of the artistic act began to take place: art moved away from religion and the representation of power to be a faithful reflection of the artist\\'s will, and focused more on the sensitive qualities of the work than on its meaning.. In this century most national art academies were created, institutions in charge of preserving art as a cultural phenomenon, of regulating its study and conservation, and of promoting it through exhibitions and competitions; originally, they also served as training centers for artists, although over time they lost this function, which was transferred to private institutions. After the Académie Royal d\\'Art, founded in Paris in 1648, this century saw the creation of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid (1744), the Russian Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (1757), the Royal Academy of Arts in London (1768), etc. The art academies favored a classical and canonical style — academicism —  often criticized for its conservatism, especially by the avant-garde movements that emerged between the 19th and 20th centuries.. During this period, when the science was gaining greater interest for scholars and the general public, numerous studies of optics were carried out. In particular, the study of shadows was deepened and scynography emerged as the science that studies the perspective and two-dimensional representation of the forms produced by shadows. Claude-Nicolas Lecat wrote in 1767: \"the art of drawing proves that the mere gradation of the shadow, its distributions and its nuances with simple light, suffice to form the images of all objects\". In the entry on shadow in L\\'Encyclopédie, the great project of Diderot and d\\'Alembert, he differentiates between several types of shadows: \"inherent\", the object itself; \"cast\", that which is projected onto another surface; \"projected\", that resulting from the interposition of a solid between a surface and the light source; \"tilted shading\", when the angle is on the vertical axis; \"tilted shading\", when it is on the horizontal axis. It also coded light sources as \"point\", \"ambient light\" and \"extensive\", the former producing shadows with clipped edges, the ambient light producing no shadow and the extensive producing shadows with little clipping divided into two areas: \"umbra\", the darkened part of the area where the light source is located; and \"penumbra\", the darkened part of the edge of a single proportion of the light area.Several treatises on painting were also written in this century that studied in depth the representation of light and shadow, such as those by Claude-Henri Watelet (L\\'Art de peindre, poème, avec des réflexions sur les différentes parties de la peinture, 1760) and Francesco Algarotti (Saggio sopra la pittura, 1764). Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (Élémens de perspective pratique, a l\\'usage des artistes, suivis de réflexions et conseils à un élève sur la peinture, et particulièrement sur le genre du paysage, 1799) made several studies on the rendering of light at various times of the day, and recorded the various factors affecting the different types of light in the atmosphere, from the rotation of the Earth to the degree of humidity in the environment and the various reflective characteristics of a particular place. He advised his students to paint the same landscape at different times of the day and especially recommended four distinctive moments of the day: morning, characterized by freshness; noon, with its blinding sun; twilight and its fiery horizon; and night with the placid effects of moonlight. Acisclo Antonio Palomino, in El Museo Pictórico y Escala Óptica (1715-1724), stated that light is \"the soul and life of everything visible\" and that \"it is in painting that gives such an extension to sight that it not only sees the physical and real but also the apparent and feigned, persuading bodies, distances and bulks with the elegant arrangement of light and dark, shadows and lights\".. Rococo meant the survival of the main artistic manifestations of the Baroque, with a more emphasized sense of decoration and ornamental taste, which were taken to a paroxysm of richness, sophistication and elegance. Rococo painting had a special reference in France, in the court scenes of Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Rococo painters preferred illuminated scenes in broad daylight or colorful sunrises and sunsets. Watteau was the painter of the fête galante, of court scenes set in bucolic landscapes, a type of shady landscape of Flemish heritage. Boucher, an admirer of Correggio, specialized in the female nude, with a soft and delicate style in which the light emphasizes the placidity of the scenes, generally mythological. Fragonard had a sentimental style of free technique, with which he elaborated gallant scenes of a certain frivolity. In the still life genre Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin stood out, a virtuoso in the creation of atmospheres and light effects on objects and surfaces, generally with a soft and warm light achieved through glazes and fading, with which he achieved intimate atmospheres of deep shadows and soft gradients.. In this century, one of the movements most concerned with the effects of light was Venetian vedutismo, a genre of urban views that meticulously depicted the canals, monuments and places most typical of Venice, alone or with the presence of the human figure, generally of small size and in large groups of people. The veduta is usually composed of wide perspectives, with a distribution of the elements close to the scenography and with a careful use of light, which collects all the tradition of atmospheric representation from the sfumato of Leonardo and the chromatic ranges of sunrises and sunsets of Claudio de Lorena. Canaletto\\'s work stands out, whose sublime landscapes of the Adriatic villa captured with great precision the atmosphere of the city suspended over the water. The great precision and detail of his works was due in large part to the use of the camera obscura, a forerunner of photography. Another outstanding representative was Francesco Guardi, interested in the sizzling effects of light on the water and the Venetian atmosphere, with a light touch technique that was a precursor of impressionism. The landscape genre continued with the naturalistic experimentation begun in the Baroque in the Netherlands. Another reference was Claude Lorrain, whose influence was especially felt in England. The 18th century landscape incorporated the aesthetic concepts of the picturesque and the sublime, which gave the genre greater autonomy. One of the first exponents was the French painter Michel-Ange Houasse, who settled in Spain and initiated a new way of understanding the role of light in the landscape: in addition to illuminating it, light \"constructs\" the landscape, configures it and gives it consistency, and determines the vision of the work, since the variation of factors involved implies a specific and particular point of view. Claude Joseph Vernet specialized in seascapes, often painted in nocturnal environments by moonlight. He was influenced by Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa, from whom he inherited the concept of an idealized and sentimental landscape. The same type of landscape was developed by Hubert Robert, with a greater interest in picturesqueness, as evidenced by his interest in ruins, which serve as the setting for many of his works.Landscape painting was also prominent in England, where the influence of Claude of Lorraine was felt to such an extent that it largely determined the planimetry of the English garden. Here there was a great love for gardens, so that landscape painting was quite sought after, unlike on the continent, where it was considered a minor genre. In this period many painters and watercolorists emerged who dedicated themselves to the transcription of the English landscape, where they captured a new sensibility towards the luminous and atmospheric effects of nature. In this type of work the main artistic value was the capture of the atmosphere and the clients valued above all a vision comparable to the contemplation of a real landscape. Prominent artists were: Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne and Thomas Gainsborough. One of the 18th century painters most concerned with light was Joseph Wright of Derby, who was interested in the effects of artificial light, which he masterfully captured. He spent some formative years in Italy, where he was interested in the effects of fireworks in the sky and painted the eruptions of Vesuvius. One of his masterpieces is Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump (1768, The National Gallery, London), where he places a powerful light source in the center that illuminates all the characters, perhaps a metaphor for the Enlightenment light that illuminates all human beings equally. The light comes from a candle hidden behind the glass jar used to perform the experiment, whose shadow is placed next to a skull, both symbols of the transience of life, often used in vanitas. Wright made several paintings with artificial lighting, which he called candle light pictures, generally with violent contrasts of light and shadow. In addition — and especially in his paintings of scientific subjects, such as the one mentioned above or A Philosopher Gives a Lesson on the Table Planetarium (1766, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby) — light symbolizes reason and knowledge, in keeping with the Enlightenment, the \"Age of Enlightenment\".. In the transition between the 18th and 19th centuries, one of the most outstanding artists was Francisco de Goya, who evolved from a more or less rococo style to a certain prerromanticism, but with a personal and expressive work with a strong intimate tone. Numerous scholars of his work have emphasized Goya\\'s metaphorical use of light as the conqueror of darkness. For Goya, light represented reason, knowledge and freedom, as opposed to the ignorance, repression and superstition associated with darkness. He also said that in painting he saw \"only illuminated bodies and bodies that are not, planes that advance and planes that recede, reliefs and depths\". The artist himself painted a self-portrait of himself in his studio against the light of a large window that fills the room with light, but as if that were not enough, he is wearing lighted candles in his hat (Autorretrato en el taller, 1793-1795, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid). At the same time, he felt a special predilection for nocturnal atmospheres and in many of his works he took up a tradition that began with Caravaggist tenebrism and reinterpreted it in a personal way. According to Jeannine Baticle, \"Goya is the faithful heir of the great Spanish pictorial tradition. In him, shadow and light create powerful volumes built in the impasto, clarified with brief luminous strokes in which the subtlety of the colors produces infinite variations\".. Among his first production, in which he was mainly in charge of the elaboration of cartoons for the Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara, El quitasol (1777, Museo del Prado, Madrid) stands out for its luminosity, which follows the popular and traditional tastes in fashion at the court at that time, where a boy shades a young woman with a parasol, with an intense chromatic contrast between the bluish and golden tones of the light reflection. Other outstanding works for their atmospheric light effects are La nevada (1786, Museo del Prado, Madrid) and La pradera de San Isidro (1788, Museo del Prado, Madrid). As a painter of the king\\'s chamber, his collective portrait La familia de Carlos IV (1800, Museo del Prado, Madrid) stands out, in which he seems to give a protocol order to the illumination, from the most powerful one centered on the kings in the central part, passing through the dimmer of the rest of the family to the penumbra in which the artist himself is portrayed in the left corner.. Of his mature work, Los fusilamientos del 3 de mayo de 1808 en la Moncloa (1814, Museo del Prado, Madrid) stands out, where he places the light source in a beacon located in the lower part of the painting, although it is his reflection in the white shirt of one of the executed men that becomes the most powerful focus of light, extolling his figure as a symbol of the innocent victim in the face of barbarism. The choice of night is a clearly symbolic factor, since it is related to death, a fact accentuated by the Christological appearance of the character with his arms raised. Albert Boime wrote about this work (Historia social del arte): Un breve repaso de las representaciones de fuentes de «luz objetiva» en la obra de Goya, revela una evolución gradual, desde la explotación de efectos tetrales para glorificar a la familia real o un suceso religioso, pasando por una expresión más simbólica de sus preocupaciones ideológicas, hasta culminar en una maestría madura donde la realidad y el símbolo se funden en una síntesis sorprendente.. Among his last works is The Milkmaid of Bordeaux (1828, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where light is captured only with color, with a fluffy brushstroke that emphasizes the tonal values, a technique that points to impressionism.. Also between the two centuries, neoclassicism developed in France after the French Revolution, a style that favored the resurgence of classical forms, purer and more austere, as opposed to the ornamental excesses of the Baroque and Rococo. The discovery of the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum helped to make Greco-Latin culture and an aesthetic ideology that advocated the perfection of classical forms as an ideal of beauty fashionable, which generated a myth about the perfection of classical beauty that still conditions the perception of art today. Neoclassical painting maintained an austere and balanced style, influenced by Greco-Roman sculpture or figures such as Raphael and Poussin. Jacques-Louis David, as well as François Gérard, Antoine-Jean Gros, Pierre-Paul Prud\\'hon, Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Anton Raphael Mengs and José de Madrazo stood out. Neoclassicism replaced the dramatic illumination of the Baroque with the restraint and moderation of classicism, with cold tones and a preponderance of drawing over color, and gave special importance to line and contour. Neoclassical images put the idea before the feeling, the truthful description of reality before the imaginative whims of the Baroque artist. Neoclassicism is a clear, cold and diffuse light, which bathes the scenes with uniformity, without violent contrasts; even so, chiaroscuro was sometimes used, intensely illuminating figures or certain objects in contrast with the darkness of the background. The light delimits the contours and space, and generally gives an appearance of solemnity to the image, in keeping with the subjects treated, usually history, mythological and portrait paintings.. The initiator of this style was Jacques-Louis David, a sober artist who completely subordinated color to drawing. He meticulously studied the light composition of his works, as can be seen in The Oath at the Jeu de Paume (1791, Musée National du Château de Versailles) and The Rape of the Sabine Women (1794-1799, Musée du Louvre, Paris). In The Death of Marat (1793, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) he developed a play of light that shows the influence of Caravaggio. Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson followed David\\'s style, although his emotivism brought him closer to pre-Romanticism. He was interested in chromaticism and the concentration of light and shadow, as glimpsed in The Dream of Endymion (1791, Musée du Louvre, Paris) and The Burial of Atala (1808, Musée du Louvre, Paris). Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres was a prolific author always faithful to classicism, to the point of being considered the champion of academic painting against 19th century romanticism. He was especially devoted to portraits and nudes, which stand out for their purity of lines, their marked contours and a chromatism close to enamel. Pierre-Paul Prud\\'hon assumed neoclassicism with a certain rococo influence, with a predilection for feminine voluptuousness inherited from Boucher and Watteau, while his work shows a strong influence of Correggio. In his mythological paintings populated by nymphs, he showed a preference for twilight and lunar light, a dim and faint light that delicately bathes the female forms, whose white skin seems to glow. Landscape painting was considered a minor genre by the neoclassicals. Even so, it had several outstanding exponents, especially in Germany, where Joseph Anton Koch, Ferdinand Kobell and Wilhelm von Kobell are worth mentioning. The former focused on the Alpine mountains, where he succeeded in capturing the cloudy atmosphere of the high mountains and the effects of sparkling light on the plant and water surfaces. He usually incorporated the human presence, sometimes with some thematic pretext of a historical or literary type — such as Shakespeare\\'s plays or the Ossian cycle. The light in his paintings is generally clear and cold, natural, without too much stridency. If Koch represented a type of idealistic landscape, heir to Poussin or Lorraine, Ferdinand Kobell represents the realistic landscape, indebted to the Dutch Baroque landscape. His landscapes of valleys and plains with mountainous backgrounds are bathed in a translucent light, with intense contrasts between the various planes of the image. His son Wilhelm followed his style, with a greater concern for light, which is denoted in his clear environments of cold light and elongated shadows, which gives his figures a hard consistency and metallic appearance. Contemporary Art. 19th Century. In the 19th century began an evolutionary dynamic of styles that followed one another chronologically with increasing speed and modern art emerged as opposed to academic art, where the artist is at the forefront of the cultural evolution of humanity. The study of light was enriched with the appearance of photography and with new technological advances in artificial light, thanks to the appearance of gaslight at the beginning of the century, kerosene in the middle of the century and electricity at the end of the century. These two phenomena brought about a new awareness of light, as this element configures the visual appearance, changing the concept of reality from the tangible to the perceptible. Romanticism. The first style of the century was Romanticism, a movement of profound renewal in all artistic genres, which paid special attention to the field of spirituality, fantasy, sentiment, love of nature, along with a darker element of irrationality, attraction to the occult, madness, dreams. Popular culture, the exotic, the return to underrated artistic forms of the past — especially medieval ones — were especially valued, and the landscape gained notoriety, which became a protagonist in its own right. The Romantics had the idea of an art that arose spontaneously from the individual, emphasizing the figure of the \"genius\": art is the expression of the artist\\'s emotions. The Romantics used a more expressive technique with respect to neoclassical restraint, modeling the forms by means of impasto and glazes, in such a way that the expressiveness of the artist is released.. In a certain pre-Romanticism we can place William Blake, an original writer and artist, difficult to classify, who devoted himself especially to illustration, in the manner of the ancient illuminators of codices. Most of Blake\\'s images are set in a nocturnal world, in which light emphasizes certain parts of the image, a light of dawn or twilight, almost \"liquid\", unreal. Between neoclassicism and romanticism was also Johann Heinrich Füssli, author of dreamlike images in a style influenced by Italian mannerism, in which he used to employ strong contrasts of light and shadow, with a type of lighting of theatrical character, like candlesticks.One of the pioneers of Romanticism was the prematurely deceased Frenchman Théodore Géricault, whose masterpiece, The Raft of the Medusa (1819, Musée du Louvre, Paris), presents a ray of light emerging from the stormy clouds in the background as a symbol of hope. The most prominent member of the movement in France was Eugène Delacroix, a painter influenced by Rubens and the Venetian school, who conceived of painting as a medium in which patches of light and color are related. He was also influenced by John Constable, whose painting The Hay Wagon opened his eyes to a new sensitivity to light. In 1832 he traveled to Morocco, where he developed a new style that could be considered proto-impressionist, characterized by the use of white to highlight light effects, with a rapid execution technique. In the field of landscape painting, John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner stood out, heirs of the rich tradition of English landscape painting of the 18th century. Constable was a pioneer in capturing atmospheric phenomena. Kenneth Clark, in The Art of Landscape, credited him with the invention of the \"chiaroscuro of nature\", which would be expressed in two ways: on the one hand, the contrast of light and shade that for Constable would be essential in any landscape painting and, on the other, the sparkling effects of dew and breeze that the British painter was able to capture so masterfully on his canvases, with a technique of interrupted strokes and touches of pure white made with a palette knife. Constable once said that \"the form of an object is indifferent; light, shadow and perspective will always make it beautiful\".Joseph Mallord William Turner was a painter with a great intuition to capture the effects of light in nature, with environments that combine luminosity with atmospheric effects of great drama, as seen in Hannibal Crossing the Alps (1812, Tate Gallery, London). Turner had a predilection for violent atmospheric phenomena, such as storms, tidal waves, fog, rain, snow, or fire and spectacles of destruction, in landscapes in which he made numerous experiments on chromaticism and luminosity, which gave his works an aspect of great visual realism. His technique was based on a colored light that dissolved the forms in a space-color-light relationship that give his work an appearance of great modernity. According to Kenneth Clark, Turner \"was the one who raised the key of color so that his paintings not only represented light, but also symbolized the nature of light\". His early works still had a certain classical component, in which he imitated the style of artists such as Claude Lorrain, Richard Wilson, Adriaen van de Velde or Aelbert Cuyp. They are works in which he still represents light by means of contrast, executed in oil; however, his watercolors already pointed to what would be his mature style, characterized by the rendering of color and light in movement, with a clear tonality achieved with a primary application of a film of mother-of-pearl paint. In 1819 he visited Italy, whose light inspired him and induced him to elaborate images where the forms were diluted in a misty luminosity, with pearly moonscapes and shades of yellow or scarlet. He then devoted himself to his most characteristic images, mainly coastal scenes in which he made a profound study of atmospheric phenomena. In Interior at Petworth (1830, British Museum, London) the basis of his design is already light and color, the rest is subordinated to these values. In his later works Clark states that \"Turner\\'s imagination was capable of distilling, from light and color, poetry as delicate as Shelley\\'s.\" Among his works are: San Giorgio Maggiore: At Dawn (1819, Tate Gallery), Regulus (1828, Tate Gallery), The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons (1835, Philadelphia Museum of Art), The Last Voyage of the \"Daredevil\" (1839, National Gallery), Negreros throwing the Dead and Dying Overboard (1840, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), Twilight over a Lake (1840, Tate Gallery), Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery), etc.. Mention should also be made of Richard Parkes Bonington, a prematurely deceased artist, primarily a watercolorist and lithographer, who lived most of his time in Paris. He had a light, clear and spontaneous style. His landscapes denote the same atmospheric sensibility of Constable and Turner, with a great delicacy in the treatment of light and color, to the point that he is considered a precursor of impressionism. In Germany the figure of Caspar David Friedrich stands out, a painter with a pantheistic and poetic vision of nature, an uncorrupted and idealized nature where the human figure only represents the role of a spectator of the grandeur and infinity of nature. From his beginnings, Friedrich developed a style marked by sure contours and subtle play of light and shadow, in watercolor, oil or sepia ink. One of his first outstanding works is The Cross on the Mountain (1808, Gemäldegalerie Neue Meister, Dresden), where a cross with Christ crucified stands on a pyramid of rocks against the light, in front of a sky furrowed with clouds and crossed by five beams of light that emerge from an invisible sun that is intuited behind the mountain, without it being clear whether it is the sunrise or the sunset; One of the beams generates reflections on the crucifix, so it is understood that it is a metal sculpture. During his early years he focused on landscapes and seascapes, with warm sunrise and sunset lights, although he also experimented with the effects of winter, stormy and foggy lights. A more mature work is Memorial Image for Johann Emanuel Bremer (1817, Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin), a night scene with a strong symbolic content alluding to death: in the foreground appears a garden in twilight, with a fence through which the rays of the moon filter; the background, with a faint light of dawn, represents the afterlife. In Woman at Sunrise (1818-1820, Folkwang Museum, Essen) — also called Woman at Sunset, since the time of day is not known with certainty — he showed one of his characteristic compositions, that of a human figure in front of the immensity of nature, a faithful reflection of the romantic feeling of the sublime, with a sky of a reddish yellow of great intensity; it is usually interpreted as an allegory of life as a permanent Holy Communion, a kind of religious communion devised by August Wilhelm von Schlegel. Between 1820 and 1822 he painted several landscapes in which he captured the variation of light at different times of the day: Morning, Noon, Afternoon and Sunset, all of them in the Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum in Hannover. For Friedrich, dawn and dusk symbolized birth and death, the cycle of life. In Sea with Sunrise (1826, Hamburger Kunsthalle, Hamburg) he reduced the composition to a minimum, playing with light and color to create an image of great intensity, inspired by the engravings of the 16th and 17th centuries that recreated the appearance of light on the first day of Creation. One of his last works was The Ages of Life (1835, Museum der bildenden Künste, Leipzig), where the five characters are related to the five boats at different distances from the horizon, symbolizing the ages of life. Other outstanding works of his are: Abbey in the Oak Grove (1809, Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin), Rainbow in a Mountain Landscape (1809-1810, Folkwang Museum, Essen), View of a Harbor (1815-1816, Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin), The Wayfarer on the Sea of Clouds (1818, Hamburger Kunsthalle, Hamburg), Moonrise on the Seaside (1821, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Sunset on the Baltic Sea (1831, Gemäldegalerie Neue Meister, Dresden), The Great Reservoir (1832, Gemäldegalerie Neue Meister, Dresden), etc.  The Norwegian Johan Christian Dahl moved in the wake of Friedrich, although with a greater interest in light and atmospheric effects, which he captured in a naturalistic way, thus moving away from the romantic landscape. In his works he shows a special interest in the sky and clouds, as well as misty and moonlit landscapes. In many of his works the sky occupies almost the entire canvas, leaving only a narrow strip of land occupied by a solitary tree.Georg Friedrich Kersting made a transposition of Friedrich\\'s pantheistic mysticism to interior scenes, illuminated by a soft light of lamps or candles that gently illuminate the domestic environments that he used to represent, giving these scenes an appearance that transcends reality to become solemn images with a certain mysterious air.. Philipp Otto Runge developed his own theory of color, according to which he differentiated between opaque and transparent colors according to whether they tended to light or darkness. In his work this distinction served to highlight the figures in the foreground from the background of the scene, which was usually translucent, generating a psychological effect of transition between planes. This served to intensify the allegorical sense of his works, since his main objective was to show the mystical character of nature. Runge was a virtuoso in capturing the subtle effects of light, a mysterious light that has its roots in Altdorfer and Grünewald, as in his portraits illuminated from below with magical reflections that illuminate the character as if immersed in a halo.. The Nazarene movement also emerged in Germany, a series of painters who between 1810 and 1830 adopted a style that was supposedly old-fashioned, inspired by Renaissance classicism — mainly Fra Angelico, Perugino and Raphael — and with an accentuated religious sense. The Nazarene style was eclectic, with a preponderance of drawing over color and a diaphanous luminosity, with limitation or even rejection of chiaroscuro. Its main representatives were: Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Franz Pforr. Also in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire there was the Biedermeier style, a more naturalistic tendency halfway between romanticism and realism. One of its main representatives was Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, an advocate of the study of nature as the only goal of painting. His paintings are brimming with a resplendent clarity, a meticulously elaborated light of almost palpable quality, as an element that builds the reality of the painting, combined with well-defined shadows. Other artists of interest in this trend are Johann Erdmann Hummel, Carl Blechen, Carl Spitzweg and Moritz von Schwind. Hummel used light as a stylizing element, with a special interest in unusual light phenomena, from artificial light to glints and reflections. Blechen evolved from a typical romanticism with a heroic and fantastic tone to a naturalism that was characterized by light after a year\\'s stay in Italy. Blechen\\'s light is summery, a bright light that accentuates the volume of objects by giving them a tactile substance, combined with a skillful use of color. Spitzweg incorporated camera obscura effects into his paintings, in which light, whether sunlight or moonlight, appears in the form of beams that create effects that are sometimes unreal but of great visual impact. Schwind was the creator of a diaphanous and lyrical light, captured in resplendent luminous spaces with subtle tonal gradations in the reflections. Lastly, we should mention the Danish Christen Købke, author of landscapes of a delicate light reminiscent of the Pointillé of Vermeer or the luminosity of Gerrit Berckheyde.. In Spain, it is worth mentioning Jenaro Pérez Villaamil, who became the first professor of landscape painting at the San Fernando Academy.  Influenced by English landscape painting — especially David Roberts — his work is characterized by his neat drawing, his graceful line and his freshness of stroke, in paintings and watercolors in which he portrays the Spanish landscape from a picturesque and archaeological perspective, with a certain component of nostalgia. In Italy in the 1830s the so-called Posillipo School, a group of anti-academic Neapolitan landscape painters, among whom Giacinto Gigante, Filippo Palizzi and Domenico Morelli stood out. These artists showed a new concern for light in the landscape, with a more truthful aspect, far from the classical canons, in which the shimmering effects gain prominence. Inspired by Vedutism and picturesque painting, as well as by the work of what they considered their direct master, Anton Sminck van Pitloo, they used to paint from life, in compositions in which the chromatism stands out without losing the solidity of the drawing. Realism. Romanticism was succeeded by realism, a trend that emphasized reality, the description of the surrounding world, especially of workers and peasants in the new framework of the industrial era, with a certain component of social denunciation, linked to political movements such as utopian socialism. These artists moved away from the usual historical, religious or mythological themes to deal with more mundane themes of modern life.One of the realist painters most concerned with light was Jean-François Millet, influenced by Baroque and Romantic landscape painting, especially Caspar David Friedrich. He specialized in peasant scenes, often in landscapes set at dawn and dusk, as in On the Way to Work (1851, private collection), Shepherdess Watching Her Flock (1863, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris) or A Norman Milkmaid at Gréville (1871, Los Angeles County Museum of Art). For the composition of his works he often used wax or clay figurines that he moved around to study the effects of light and volume. His technique was dense and vigorous brushwork, with strong contrasts of light and shadow. His masterpiece is The Angelus (1857, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris): the evening setting of this work allows its author to emphasize the dramatic aspect of the scene, translated pictorially in non-contrasting tonalities, with the darkened figures standing out against the brightness of the sky, which increases its volumetry and accentuates its outline, resulting in an emotional vision that emphasizes the social message that the artist wants to convey. One of his last works was Bird Hunters (1874, Philadelphia Museum of Art), a nocturnal setting in which some peasants dazzle birds with a torch to hunt them, in which the luminosity of the torch stands out, achieved with a dense application of the pictorial impasto.The champion of realism was Gustave Courbet, who in his training was nourished by Flemish, Dutch and Venetian painting of the 16th and 17th centuries, especially Rembrandt. His early works are still of romantic inspiration, in which he uses a dramatic light tone borrowed from the Flemish-Dutch tradition but reinterpreted with a more modern sensibility. His mature work, now fully realistic, shows the influence of the Le Nain brothers, and is characterized by large, meticulously worked works, with large shiny surfaces and a dense application of pigment, often done with a palette knife. At the end of his career he devoted himself more to landscape and nudes, which stand out for their luminous sensibility. Another reference was Honoré Daumier, painter, lithographer, and caricaturist with a strong satirical tone, loose and free stroke, with an effective use of chiaroscuro. In his paintings he was inspired by the light contrasts of Goya, giving his works little colorism and giving greater emphasis to light (The Fugitives, 1850; Barabbas, 1850; The Butcher, 1857; The Third Wagon, 1862).. Linked to realism was the French landscape school of Barbizon (Camille Corot, Théodore Rousseau, Charles-François Daubigny, Narcisse-Virgile Díaz de la Peña), marked by a pantheistic feeling of nature, with concern for the effects of light in the landscape, such as the light that filters through the branches of trees. The most outstanding was Camille Corot, who discovered light in Italy, where he dedicated himself to painting outdoors Roman landscapes captured at different times of the day, in scenes of clean atmospheres in which he applied to the surfaces of the volumes the precise doses of light to achieve a panoramic vision in which the volumes are cut out in the atmosphere. Corot had a predilection for a type of tremulous light that reflected on the water or filtered through the branches of the trees, with which he found a formula that satisfied him while achieving great popularity among the public. Eugène Boudin, one of the first landscape painters to paint outdoors, especially seascapes, also stood out as an independent artist. He achieved great mastery in the elaboration of skies, shimmering and slightly misty skies of dim and transparent light, a light that is also reflected in the water with instantaneous effects that he knew how to capture with spontaneity and precision, with a fast technique that already pointed to impressionism — in fact, he was Monet\\'s teacher.Naturalistic landscape painting had another outstanding representative in Germany, Adolph von Menzel, who was influenced by Constable and developed a style in which light is decisive for the visual aspect of his works, with a technique that was a precursor of impressionism. Also noteworthy are his interior scenes with artificial light, in which he recreates a multitude of anecdotal details and luminous effects of all kinds, as in his Dinner after the Ball (1878, Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin). Next to him stands out Hans Thoma, who was influenced by Courbet, who in his works combined the social vindication of realism with a still somewhat romantic feeling of the landscape. Thoma was an exponent of a \"lyrical realism\", with landscapes and paintings of peasant themes, usually set in his native Black Forest, characterized by the use of a silver-toned light.. In the Netherlands there was the figure of Johan Barthold Jongkind, considered a pre-impressionist, whom Monet also considered his master. He was a great interpreter of atmospheric phenomena and of the play of light on water and snow, as well as of winter and night lights — his moonlit landscapes were highly valued.. In Russia, a notable realist school also emerged, which developed both in landscape and genre scenes, generally endowed with a strong sense of social denunciation. Its main representatives were Vasili Perov, Iván Kramskói, Isaak Levitán, and especially, Iliá Repin.. In Spain, Carlos de Haes, Agustín Riancho and Joaquín Vayreda deserve to be mentioned. Haes, of Belgian origin, traveled the entire Spanish geography to capture its landscapes, which he captured with an almost topographical detail. Riancho had a predilection for mountain scenery, with a coloring with a certain tendency to dark shades, free and spontaneous. Vayreda was the founder of the so-called Olot School. Influenced by the Barbizon School, he applied this style to the Girona landscape, with works of diaphanous and serene composition with a certain lyrical component of bucolic evocation.. Also in Spain it is worth mentioning the work of Mariano Fortuny, who found his personal style in Morocco as a chronicler of the African War (1859-1860), where he discovered the colorfulness and exoticism that would characterize his work. Here he began to paint with quick sketches of luminous touches, with which he captured the action in a spontaneous and vigorous way, and which would be the basis of his style: a vibrantly executed colorism with flashing light effects, as is denoted in one of his masterpieces, La vicaría (1868-1870, Museo Nacional de Arte de Cataluña, Barcelona).. Another landscape school was the Italian school of the Macchiaioli (Silvestro Lega, Giovanni Fattori, Telemaco Signorini), of anti-academic style, characterized by the use of stains (macchia in Italian, hence the name of the group) of color and unfinished forms, sketched, a movement that preceded Impressionism. These artists painted from life and had as their main objective the reduction of painting to contrasts of light and brilliance. According to Diego Martelli, one of the theorists of the group, \"we affirmed that form did not exist and that, just as in light everything results from color and chiaroscuro, so it is a matter of obtaining tones, the effects of the true\". The Manchists revalued the light contrasts and knew how to transcribe in their canvases the power and clarity of the Mediterranean light. They captured like no one else the effects of the sun on objects and landscapes, as in the painting The Patrol by Giovanni Fattori, in which the artist uses a white wall as a luminous screen on which the figures are cut out. In Great Britain, the school of the Pre-Raphaelites emerged, who were inspired — as their name indicates — by Italian painters before Raphael, as well as by the recently emerged photography, with exponents such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt and Ford Madox Brown. The Pre-Raphaelites sought a realistic vision of the world, based on images of great detail, vivid colors and brilliant workmanship; as opposed to the side lighting advocated by academicist painting, they preferred general lighting, which turned paintings into flat images, without great contrasts of light and shadow. To achieve maximum realism, they carried out numerous investigations, as in the painting The Rescuer (1855, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), by John Everett Millais, in which a fireman saves two girls from a fire, for which the artist burned wood in his workshop to find the right lighting. The almost photographic detail of these works led John Ruskin to say of William Holman Hunt\\'s The Wandering Sheep (1852, Tate Britain, London) that \"for the first time in the history of art the absolutely faithful balance between color and shade is achieved, by which the actual brightness of the sun could be transported into a key by which possible harmonies with material pigments should produce on the mind the same impressions as are made by the light itself.\" Hunt was also the author of The Light of the World (1853, Keble College, Oxford University), in which light has a symbolic meaning, related to the biblical passage that identifies Christ with the phrase \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, for he shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This painter again portrayed the symbolic light of Jesus Christ in The Awakening of Consciousness (1853, Tate Britain), through the light of the garden streaming through the window. Romanticism and realism were the first artistic movements that rejected the official art of the time, the art taught in the academies — academicism — an art that was institutionalized and anchored in the past both in the choice of subjects and in the techniques and resources made available to the artist. In France, in the second half of the 19th century, this art was called art pompier (\"fireman\\'s art\", a pejorative name derived from the fact that many authors represented classical heroes with helmets that resembled fireman\\'s helmets). Although in principle the academies were in tune with the art produced at the time, so we can not speak of a distinct style, in the 19th century, when the evolutionary dynamics of the styles began to move away from the classical canons, academic art was constrained in a classicist style based on strict rules. Academicism was stylistically based on Greco-Roman classicism, but also on earlier classicist authors, such as Raphael, Poussin or Guido Reni. Technically, it was based on careful drawing, formal balance, perfect line, plastic purity and careful detailing, together with realistic and harmonious coloring. Many of its representatives had a special predilection for the nude as an artistic theme, as well as a special attraction for orientalism. Its main representatives were: William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Eùgene-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval and Jean-Léon Gérôme. Impressionism. Light played a fundamental role in impressionism, a style based on the representation of an image according to the \"impression\" that light produces to the eye. In contrast to academic art and its forms of representation based on linear perspective and geometry, the Impressionists sought to capture reality on the canvas as they perceived it visually, so they gave all the prominence to light and color. To this end, they used to paint outdoors (en plen air), capturing the various effects of light on the surrounding environment at different times of the day. They studied in depth the laws of optics and the physics of light and color. Their technique was based on loose brushstrokes and a combination of colors applied according to the viewer\\'s vision, with a preponderance of contrast between elementary colors (yellow, red and blue) and their complements (orange, green and violet). In addition, they used to apply the pigment directly on the canvas, without mixing, thus achieving greater luminosity and brilliance.Impressionism perfected the capture of light by means of fragmented touches of color, a procedure that had already been used to a greater or lesser extent by artists such as Giorgione, Titian, Guardi and Velázquez (it is well known that the Impressionists admired the genius of Las Meninas, whom they considered \"the painter of painters\"). For the Impressionists, light was the protagonist of the painting, so they began to paint from life, capturing at all times the variations of light on landscapes and objects, the fleeting \"impression\" of light at different times of the day, so they often produced series of paintings of the same place at different times. For this they dispensed with drawing and defined form and volume directly with color, in loose brushstrokes of pure tones, juxtaposed with each other. They also abandoned chiaroscuro and violent contrasts of light and shadow, for which they dispensed with colors such as black, gray or brown: the chromatic research of impressionism led to the discarding of black in painting, since they claimed that it is a color that does not exist in nature. From there they began to use a luminous range of \"light on light\" (white, blue, pink, red, violet), elaborating the shades with cold tones. Thus, the impressionists concluded that there is neither form nor color, the only real thing is the air-light relationship. In impressionist paintings the theme is light and its effects, beyond the anecdotal of places and characters. Impressionism was considerably influenced by research in the field of photography, which had shown that the vision of an object depends on the quantity and quality of light. His discovery consists precisely in having realized that full light discolors tones, that the sun reflected by objects tends, by dint of clarity, to resize them in that luminous unity that fuses the seven prismatic rays into a single colorless brightness, which is light.. Impressionist painters were especially concerned with artificial light: according to Juan Antonio Ramirez (Mass Media and Art History, 1976), \"the surprise at the effect of the new phenomenon of artificial light in the street, in cafés, and in the living room, gave rise to famous paintings such as Manet\\'s Un bar aux Folies Bergère (1882, Courtauld Gallery, London), Renoir\\'s Dancing at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris) and Degas\\' Women in a Café (1877, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris). Such paintings show the lighted lanterns and that glaucous tonality that only artificial light produces\". Numerous Impressionist works are set in bars, cafés, dances, theaters and other establishments, with lamps or candelabras of dim light that mixes with the smoky air of the atmosphere of these places, or candle lights in the case of theaters and opera houses.The main representatives were Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas, with an antecedent in Édouard Manet. The most strictly Impressionist painters were Monet, Sisley and Pissarro, the most concerned with capturing light in the landscape. Monet was a master in capturing atmospheric phenomena and the vibration of light on water and objects, with a technique of short brushstrokes of pure colors. He produced the greatest number of series of the same landscape at different times of the day, to capture all the nuances and subtle differences of each type of light, as in his series of The Station of Saint-Lazare, Haystacks, The Poplars, The Cathedral of Rouen, The Parliament of London, San Giorgio Maggiore or Water Lilies. His last works in Giverny on water lilies are close to abstraction, in which he achieves an unparalleled synthesis of light and color. In the mid-1880s he painted coastal scenes of the French Riviera with the highest degree of luminous intensity ever achieved in painting, in which the forms dissolve in pure incandescence and whose only subject is already the sensation of light.Sisley also showed a great interest in the changing effects of light in the atmosphere, with a fragmented touch similar to that of Monet. His landscapes are of great lyricism, with a predilection for aquatic themes and a certain tendency to the dissolution of form. Pissarro, on the other hand, focused more on a rustic-looking landscape painting, with a vigorous and spontaneous brushstroke that conveyed \"an intimate and profound feeling for nature\", as the critic Théodore Duret said of him. In addition to his countryside landscapes, he produced urban views of Paris, Rouen and Dieppe, and also produced series of paintings at various times of the day and night, such as those of the Avenue de l\\'Opera and the Boulevard de Montmartre. Renoir developed a more personal style, notable for its optimism and joie de vivre. He evolved from a realism of Courbetian influence to an impressionism of light and luminous colors, and shared for a time a style similar to that of Monet, with whom he spent several stays in Argenteuil. He differed from the latter especially in his greater presence of the human figure, an essential element for Renoir, as well as the use of tones such as black that were rejected by the other members of the group. He liked the play of light and shadow, which he achieved by means of small spots, and achieved great mastery in effects such as the beams of light between the branches of trees, as seen in his work Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris), and in Torso, sunlight effect where sunlight is seen on the skin of a naked girl (1875, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris).. Degas was an individual figure, who although he shared most of the impressionist assumptions never considered himself part of the group. Contrary to the preferences of his peers, he did not paint from life and used drawing as a compositional basis. His work was influenced by photography and Japanese prints, and from his beginnings he showed interest in night and artificial light, as he himself expressed: \"I work a lot on night effects, lamps, candles, etc. The curious thing is not always to show the light source, but the effect of the light\". In his series of works on dancers or horse races, he studied the effects of light in movement, in a disarticulated space in which the effects of lights and backlighting stand out.Many Impressionist works were almost exclusively about the effects of light on the landscape, which they tried to recreate as spontaneously as possible. However, this led in the 1880s to a certain reaction in which they tried to return to more classical canons of representation and a return to the figure as the basis of the composition. From then on, several styles derived from impressionism emerged, such as neo-impressionism (also called divisionism or pointillism) and post-impressionism. Neo-Impressionism took up the optical experimentation of Impressionism: the Impressionists used to blur the contours of objects by lowering the contrasts between light and shadow, which implied replacing objectual solidity with a disembodied luminosity, a process that culminated in Pointillism: in this technique there is no precise source of illumination, but each point is a light source in itself. The composition is based on juxtaposed (\"divided\") dots of a pure color, which merge in the eye of the viewer at a given distance. When these juxtaposed colors were complementary (red-green, yellow-violet, orange-blue) a greater luminosity was achieved. Pointillism, based largely on the theories of Michel-Eugène Chevreul (The Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colors, 1839) and Ogden Rood (Modern Chromatics, 1879), defended the exclusive use of pure and complementary colors, applied in small brushstrokes in the form of dots that composed the image on the viewer\\'s retina, at a certain distance. Its best exponents were Georges Seurat and Paul Signac.. Seurat devoted his entire life to the search for a method that would reconcile science and aesthetics, a personal method that would transcend impressionism. His main concern was chromatic contrast, its gradation and the interaction between colors and their complementaries. He created a disc with all the tones of the rainbow united by their intermediate colors and placed the pure tones in the center, which he gradually lightened towards the periphery, where the pure white was located, so that he could easily locate the complementary colors. This disc allowed him to mix the colors in his mind before fixing them on the palette, thus reducing the loss of chromatic intensity and luminosity. In his works he first drew in black and white to achieve the maximum balance between light and dark masses, and applied the color by tiny dots that were mixed in the retina of the viewer by optical mixing. On the other hand, he took from Charles Henry his theory on the relationship between aesthetics and physiology, how some forms or spatial directions could express pleasure and pain; according to this author, warm colors were dynamogenic and cold ones inhibitory. From 1886 he focused more on interior scenes with artificial light. His work Chahut (1889-1890, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo) had a powerful influence on Cubism for its way of modeling volumes in space through light, without the need to simulate a third dimension.. Signac was a disciple of Seurat, although with a freer and more spontaneous style, not so scientific, in which the brilliance of color stands out. In his last years his works evolved to a search for pure sensation, with a chromatism of expressionist tendency, while he reduced the pointillist technique to a grid of tesserae of larger sizes than the divisionist dots.. In Italy there was a variant — the so-called divisionisti — who applied this technique to scenes of greater social commitment, due to its link with socialism, although with some changes in technical execution, since instead of confronting complementary colors they contrasted them in terms of rays of light, producing images that stand out for their luminosity and transparency, as in the work of Angelo Morbelli. Gaetano Previati developed a style in which luminosity is linked to symbolism related to life and nature, as in his Maternity (1890-1891, Banca Popolare di Novara), generally with a certain component of poetic evocation. Another member of the group, Vittore Grubicy de Dragon, wrote that \"light is life and, if, as many rightly affirm, art is life, and light is a form of life, the divisionist technique, which tends to greatly increase the expressiveness of the canvas, can become the cradle of new aesthetic horizons for tomorrow\".. Post-impressionism was, rather than a homogeneous movement, a grouping of diverse artists initially trained in impressionism who later followed individual trajectories of great stylistic diversity. Its best representatives were Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh. Cézanne established a compositional system based on geometric figures (cube, cylinder and pyramid), which would later influence Cubism. He also devised a new method of illumination, in which light is applied in the density and intensity of color, rather than in the transitional values between black and white. The one who experimented the most in the field of light was Van Gogh, author of works of strong dramatism and interior prospection, with sinuous and dense brushstrokes, of intense color, in which he deforms reality, to which he gave a dreamlike air. Van Gogh\\'s work shows influences as disparate as those of Millet and Hiroshige, while from the Impressionist school he was particularly influenced by Renoir. Already in his early works, his interest in light is noticeable, which is why he gradually clarified his palette, until he practically reached a yellow monochrome, with a fierce and temperamental luminosity.. In his early works, such as The Potato Eaters (1885, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam), the influence of Dutch realism, which had a tendency to chiaroscuro and dense color with thick brushstrokes, is evident; here he created a dramatic atmosphere of artificial light that emphasizes the tragedy of the miserable situation of these workers marginalized by the Industrial Revolution. Later his coloring became more intense, influenced by the divisionist technique, with a technique of superimposing brushstrokes in different tones; for the most illuminated areas he used yellow, orange and reddish tones, seeking a harmonious relationship between them all. After settling in Arles in Arles in 1888 he was fascinated by the limpid Mediterranean light and in his landscapes of that period he created clear and shining atmospheres, with hardly any chiaroscuro. As was usual in impressionism, he sometimes made several versions of the same motif at different times of the day to capture its light variations. He also continued his interest in artificial and nocturnal lights, as in Café de noche, interior (1888, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), where the light of the lamps seems to vibrate thanks to the concentric halo-shaped circles with which he has reflected the radiation of the light; or Café de noche, exterior (1888, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo), where the luminosity of the café terrace contrasts with the darkness of the sky, where the stars seem like flowers of light. Light also plays a special role in his Sunflowers series (1888-1889), where he used all imaginable shades of yellow, which for him symbolized light and life, as he expressed in a letter to his brother Theo: \"a sun, a light that, for lack of a better adjective, I can only define with yellow, a pale sulfur yellow, a pale lemon yellow\". To highlight the yellow and orange, he used green and sky blue in the outlines, creating an effect of soft light intensity.. In Italy during these years there was a movement called Scapigliatura (1860-1880), sometimes considered a predecessor of divisionism, characterized by its interest in the purity of color and the study of light. Artists like Tranquillo Cremona, Mosè Bianchi or Daniele Ranzoni tried to capture on canvas their feelings through chromatic vibrations and blurred contours, with characters and objects almost dematerialized. Giovanni Segantini, a personal artist who combined a drawing of academicist tradition with a post-impressionist coloring where the light effects have a great relief. Segantini\\'s specialty was the mountain landscape, which he painted outdoors, with a technique of strong brushstrokes and simple colors, with a vibrant light that he only found in the high alpine mountains. In Germany, impressionism was represented by Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt. The first was more of a plenairist than strictly an impressionist, although more than landscape painting he devoted himself to genre painting, especially of religious themes, works in which he also showed a special sensitivity to light. Corinth had a rather eclectic career, from academic beginnings — he was a disciple of Bouguereau — through realism and impressionism, to a certain decadentism and an approach to Jugendstil, to finally end up in expressionism. Influenced by Rembrandt and Rubens, he painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes with a serene and brilliant chromatism. Slevogt assumed the fresh and brilliant chromatism of the Impressionists, although renouncing the fragmentation of colors that they made, and his technique was of loose brushstrokes and energetic movement, with bold and original light effects, which denote a certain influence of the baroque art of his native Bavaria.. In Great Britain, the work of James Abbott McNeil Whistler, American by birth but established in London since 1859, stood out. His landscapes are the antithesis of the sunny French landscapes, as they recreate the foggy and taciturn English climate, with a preference for night scenes, images from which he nevertheless knows how to distill an intense lyricism, with artificial light effects reflected in the waters of the Thames.In the United States, it is worth mentioning the work of John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam. Sargent was an admirer of Velázquez and Frans Hals, and excelled as a social portraitist, with a virtuoso and elegant technique, both in oil and watercolor, the latter mainly in landscapes of intense color. Cassatt lived for a long time in Paris, where he was related to the Impressionist circle, with whom he shared more the themes than the technique, and developed an intimate and sophisticated work, influenced by Japanese prints. Hassam\\'s main motif was New York life, with a fresh but somewhat cloying style.. Mention should also be made of Scandinavian impressionism, many of whose artists were trained in Paris. These painters had a special sensitivity to light, perhaps due to its absence in their native land, so they traveled to France and Italy attracted by the \"light of the south\". The main exponents were Peder Severin Krøyer, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, and Anders Zorn. The former showed a special interest in highly complex lighting effects, such as the mixing of natural and artificial light. Gallen-Kallela was an original artist who later approached symbolism, with a personal expressive and stylized painting with a tendency towards romanticism, with a special interest in Finnish folklore. Zorn specialized in portraits, nudes and genre scenes, with a brilliant brushstroke of vibrant luminosity.. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin should be mentioned. Serov had a style similar to that of Manet or Renoir, with a taste for intense chromatism and light reflections, a bright light that extols the joy of life. Korovin painted both urban landscapes — Parisian street scenes — and natural landscapes — summer images in Crimea — in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art. In Spain, the work of Aureliano de Beruete and Darío de Regoyos stands out. Beruete was a disciple of Carlos de Haes, so he was trained in the realist landscape, but assumed the impressionist technique after a period of training in France. An admirer of Velazquez\\'s light, he knew how to apply it to the Castilian landscape — especially the mountains of Madrid — with his own personal style. Regoyos also trained with Haes and developed an intimate style halfway between pointillism and expressionism. Luminism and symbolism. From the mid-19th century until practically the transition to the 20th century, various styles emerged that placed special emphasis on the representation of light, which is why they were generically referred to as \"luminism\", with various national schools in the United States and various European countries or regions. The term luminism was introduced by John Ireland Howe Baur in 1954 to designate the landscape painting done in the United States between 1840 and 1880, which he defines as \"a polished and meticulous realism in which there are no noticeable brushstrokes and no trace of impressionism, and in which atmospheric effects are achieved by infinitely careful gradations of tone, by the most exact study of the relative clarity of nearer and more distant objects, and by an accurate rendering of the variations of texture and color produced by direct or reflected rays\".The first was American Luminism, which gave rise to a group of landscape painters generally grouped in the so-called Hudson River School, in which we can include to a greater or lesser extent Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Martin Johnson Heade, Fitz Henry Lane, John Frederick Kensett, James Augustus Suydam, Francis Augustus Silva, Jasper Francis Cropsey and George Caleb Bingham. In general, his works were based on bombastic compositions, with a horizon line of great depth and a sky of veiled aspect, with atmospheres of strong expressiveness. His light is serene and peaceful, reflecting a mood of love for nature, a nature largely in the United States of the time virgin and paradisiacal, yet to be explored. It is a transcendent light, of spiritual significance, whose radiance conveys a message of communion with nature. Although they use a classical structure and composition, the treatment of light is original because of the infinity of subtle variations in tonality, achieved through a meticulous study of the natural environment of their country. According to Barbara Novak, Luminism is a more serene form of the romantic aesthetic concept of the sublime, which had its translation in the deep expanses of the North American landscape.. Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting: in the former, the landscape — more centered in the New England area — is more peaceful, more anecdotal, with delicate tonal gradations characterized by a crystalline light that seems to emanate from the canvas, in neat brushstrokes that seem to recreate the surface of a mirror and in compositions in which the excess of detail is unreal due to its straightness and geometrism, resulting in an idealization of nature. Thus understood, Luminism would encompass Heade, Lane, Kensett, Suydam and Silva. Hudson River landscape painting, on the other hand, would have a more cosmic vision and a predilection for a wilder and more grandiloquent nature, with more dramatic visual effects, as seen in the work of Cole, Durand, Church, Bierstadt, Cropsey and Bingham. It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving \"an elevated style of landscape\" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting. He also painted biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component, as in his Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole\\'s premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time. An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole\\'s allegorical one. Church was Cole\\'s first disciple, who transmitted to him his vision of a majestic and exuberant nature, which he reflected in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner, whose atmospheric effects are seen in works such as In the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D. C.), a lake between mountains seen after a storm, with the sun\\'s rays breaking through the clouds. Heade was devoted to country landscapes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, in meadows of endless horizons with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day, sometimes refracted by humid atmospheres. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism. Handicapped since childhood by polio, he focused on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon, in which light has a special role, a placid light that gives a sense of eternity, of time stopped in a serene perfection and harmony. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style. Bingham masterfully captured in his scenes of the Far West the limpid and clear light of dawn, his favorite when recreating scenes with American Indians and pioneers of the conquest of the West.. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, who excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, deserves special mention. One of his favorite genres was the seascape, in which he displayed a great interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day. His painting Moonlight. Wood Island Lighthouse (1894, Museum of Modern Art, New York) was painted entirely by moonlight, in five hours of work. Another important school was Belgian Luminism. In Belgium, the influence of French Impressionism was strongly felt, initially in the work of the group called Les Vingt, as well as in the School of Tervueren, a group of landscape painters who already showed their interest in light, especially in the atmospheric effects, as can be seen in the work of Isidore Verheyden. Later, Pointillism was the main influence on Belgian artists of the time, a trend embraced by Émile Claus and Théo van Rysselberghe, the main representatives of Belgian Luminism. Claus adopted Impressionist techniques, although he maintained academic drawing as the basis for his compositions, and in his work — mainly landscapes — he showed great interest in the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions, with a style that sometimes recalls Monet. Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as by the Baroque painter Frans Hals and Spanish painting. His technique was of loose and vigorous brushwork, with great luminous contrasts.A luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, more closely linked to the incipient Fauvism, in which Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, Jan Sluyters, and the early work of Piet Mondrian stood out. Toorop was an eclectic artist, who combined different styles in the search for his own language, such as symbolism, modernism, pointillism, Gauguinian synthetism, Beardsley\\'s linearism, and Japanese printmaking. He was especially devoted to allegorical and symbolic themes and, since 1905, to religious themes.. In Germany, Max Liebermann received an initial realist influence — mainly from Millet — and a slight impressionist inclination towards 1890, until he ended up in a luminism of personal inspiration, with violent brushstrokes and brilliant light, a light of his own research with which he experimented until his death in 1935.In Spain, luminism developed especially in Valencia and Catalonia. The main representative of the Valencian school was Joaquín Sorolla, although the work of Ignacio Pinazo, Teodoro Andreu, Vicente Castell and Francisco Benítez Mellado is also noteworthy. Sorolla was a master at capturing the light in nature, as is evident in his seascapes, painted with a gradual palette of colors and a variable brushstroke, wider for specific shapes and smaller to capture the different effects of light. An interpreter of the Mediterranean sun like no other, a French critic said of him that \"never has a paintbrush contained so much sun\". After a period of training, in the 1890s he began to consolidate his style, based on a genre theme with a technique of rapid execution, preferably outdoors, with a thick brushstroke, energetic and impulsive, and with a constant concern for the capture of light, on which he did not cease to investigate its more subtle effects. La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind. It was followed by Pescadores valencianos (1895), Cosiendo la vela (1896) and Comiendo en la barca (1898). In 1900 he visited with Aureliano de Beruete the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was fascinated by the intense chromatism of the Nordic artists, such as Anders Zorn, Max Liebermann or Peder Severin Krøyer; From here he intensified his coloring and, especially, his luminosity, with a light that invaded the whole painting, emphasizing the blinding whites, as in Jávea (1900), Idilio (1900), Playa de Valencia (1902), in two versions, morning and sunset, Evening Sun (1903), The Three Sails (1903), Children at the Seashore (1903), Fisherman (1904), Summer (1904), The White Boat (1905), Bathing in Jávea (1905), etc. They are preferably seascape, with a warm Mediterranean light of which he feels special predilection for that of the month of September, more golden. From 1906 he lowered the intensity of his palette, with a more nuanced tonality and a predilection for mauve ink; he continued with the seascapes, but increased the production of other types of landscapes, as well as gardens and portraits. He summered in Biarritz and the pale and soft light of the Atlantic Ocean made him lower the luminosity of his works. He also continues with his Valencian scenes: Paseo a orillas del mar (1909), Después del baño (1909). Between 1909 and 1910 his stays in Andalusia induced him to blur the contours, with a technique close to pointillism, with a predominance of white, pink, and mauve. Among his last works is La bata rosa (1916), in which he unleashes an abundance of light that filters through all parts of the canvas, highlighting the use of light and color on the treatment of the contours, which appear blurred.. The Luminist School of Sitges emerged in Catalonia, active in this town in the Garraf between 1878 and 1892. Its most prominent members were Arcadi Mas i Fondevila, Joaquim de Miró, Joan Batlle i Amell, Antoni Almirall and Joan Roig i Soler. Opposed in a certain way to the Olot School, whose painters treated the landscape of the interior of Catalonia with a softer and more filtered light, the Sitgetan artists opted for the warm and vibrant Mediterranean light and the atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast. Heirs to a large extent of Fortuny, the members of this school sought to faithfully reflect the luminous effects of the surrounding landscape, in harmonious compositions that combined verism and a certain poetic and idealized vision of nature, with a subtle chromaticism and a fluid brushstroke that was sometimes described as impressionist.The Sitges School is generally considered a precursor of Catalan modernism: two of its main representatives, Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusiñol, spent several seasons in the town of Sitges, where they adopted the custom of painting d\\'après nature and assumed as the protagonist of their works the luminosity of the environment that surrounded them, although with other formal and compositional solutions in which the influence of French painting is evident. Casas studied in Paris, where he was trained in impressionism, with special influence of Degas and Whistler. His technique stands out for the synthetic brushstroke and the somewhat blurred line, with a theme focused preferably on interiors and outdoor images, as well as popular scenes and social vindication. Rusiñol showed a special sensitivity for the capture of light especially in his landscapes and his series of Gardens of Spain — he especially loved the gardens of Mallorca (the sones) and Granada — in which he developed a great ability for the effects of light filtered between the branches of the trees, creating unique environments where light and shadow play capriciously. Likewise, Rusiñol\\'s light shows the longing for the past, for the time that flees, for the instant frozen in time whose memory will live on in the artist\\'s work. From the 1880s until the turn of the century, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist and impressionist currents, placing special emphasis on the world of dreams, as well as on satanic and terrifying aspects, sex and perversion. A main characteristic of symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Symbolism gave art and beauty an autonomy of their own, synthesized in Théophile Gautier\\'s formula \"art for art\\'s sake\" (L\\'art pour l\\'art). This current was also linked to modernism (also known as Art Nouveau in France, Modern Style in the United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy). Symbolism was an anti-scientific and anti-naturalist movement, so light lost objectivity and was used as a symbolic element, in conjunction with the rest of the visual and iconographic resources of this style. It is a transcendent light, which behind the material world suggests a spirituality, whether religious or pantheistic, or perhaps simply a state of mind of the artist, a feeling, an emotion. Light, by its dematerialization, exerted a powerful influence on these artists, a light far removed from the physical world in its conception, although for its execution they often made use of impressionist and pointillist techniques.. The movement originated in France with figures such as Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. Moreau was still trained in romanticism under the influence of his teacher, Théodore Chassériau, but evolved a personal style in both subject matter and technique, with mystical images with a strong component of sensuality, a resplendent chromaticism with an enamel-like finish and the use of a chiaroscuro of golden shadows. Redon developed a fantastic and dreamlike theme, influenced by the literature of Edgar Allan Poe, which largely preceded surrealism. Until the age of fifty he worked almost exclusively in charcoal drawing and lithography, although he later became an excellent colorist, both in oil and pastel. Puvis de Chavannes was an outstanding muralist, a procedure that suited him well to develop his preference for cold tones, which gave the appearance of fresco painting. His style was more serene and harmonious, with an allegorical theme evoking an idealized past, simple forms, rhythmic lines and a subjective coloring, far from naturalism. In France there was also the movement of the Nabis (\"prophets\" in Hebrew), formed by Paul Sérusier, Édouard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis and Félix Vallotton. This group was influenced by Gauguin\\'s rhythmic scheme and stood out for an intense chromatism of strong expressiveness. Another focus of symbolism was Belgium, where the work of Félicien Rops, Fernand Khnopff and William Degouve de Nuncques should be noted. The first was a painter and graphic artist of great imagination, with a predilection for a theme centered on perversity and eroticism. Khnopff developed a dreamlike-allegorical theme of women transformed into angels or sphinxes, with disturbing atmospheres of great technical refinement. Degouve de Nuncques elaborated urban landscapes with a preference for nocturnal settings, with a dreamlike component precursor of surrealism: his work The Blind House (1892, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo) influenced René Magritte\\'s The Empire of Lights (1954, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels).. In Central Europe, the Swiss Arnold Böcklin and Ferdinand Hodler and the Austrian Gustav Klimt stood out. Böcklin specialized in a theme of fantastic beings, such as nymphs, satyrs, tritons or naiads, with a somber and somewhat morbid style, such as his painting The Island of the Dead (1880, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), where a pale, cold and whitish light envelops the atmosphere of the island where Charon\\'s boat is headed. Hodler evolved from a certain naturalism to a personal style he called \"parallelism\", characterized by rhythmic schemes in which line, form and color are reproduced in a repetitive way, with simplified and monumental figures. It was in his landscapes that he showed the greatest luminosity, with pure and vibrant coloring. Klimt had an academic training, to lead to a personal style that synthesized impressionism, modernism and symbolism. He had a preference for mural painting, with an allegorical theme with a tendency towards eroticism, and with a decorative style populated with arabesques, butterfly wings or peacocks, and with a taste for the golden color that gave his works an intense luminosity.In Italy, it is worth mentioning Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, formed in the divisionist environment, but who evolved to a personal style marked by an intense and vibrant light, whose starting point is his work Lost Hopes (1894, Ponti-Grün collection, Rome). In The Rising Sun or the Sun (1903-1904, National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome) he carried out a prodigious exercise in the exaltation of light, a refulgent dawn light that peeks over a mountainous horizon and seems to burst into a myriad of rays that spread in all directions, dazzling the viewer. A symbolic reading can be established for this work, given the social and political commitment of the artist, since the rising sun was taken by socialism as a metaphor for the new society to which this ideology aspired.. In the Scandinavian sphere, it is worth remembering the Norwegian Christian Krohg and the Danish Vilhelm Hammershøi and Jens Ferdinand Willumsen. The former combined natural and artificial lights, often with theatrical effects and certain unreal connotations, as in The Sleeping Seamstress (1885, Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo), where the double presence of a lamp next to a window through which daylight enters provokes a sensation of timelessness, of temporal indefinition. Hammershøi was a virtuoso in the handling of light, which he considered the main protagonist of his works. Most of his paintings were set in interior spaces with lights filtered through doors or windows, with figures generally with their backs turned. Willumsen developed a personal style based on the influence of Gauguin, with a taste for bright colors, as in After the Storm (1905, Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo), a navy with a dazzling sun that seems to explode in the sky.. Finally, it is worth mentioning a phenomenon between the 19th and 20th centuries that was a precedent for avant-garde art, especially in terms of its anti-academic component: naïf art (\"naïve\" in French), a term applied to a series of self-taught painters who developed a spontaneous style, alien to the technical and aesthetic principles of traditional painting, sometimes labeled as childish or primitive. One of its best representatives was Henri Rousseau, a customs officer by trade, who produced a personal work, with a poetic tone and a taste for the exotic, in which he lost interest in perspective and resorted to unreal-looking lighting, without shadows or perceptible light sources, a type of image that influenced artists such as Picasso or Kandinski and movements such as metaphysical painting and surrealism. 20th Century. The art of the 20th century underwent a profound transformation: in a more materialistic, more consumerist society, art was directed to the senses, not to the intellect. The avant-garde movements arose, which sought to integrate art into society through a greater interrelation between artist and spectator, since it was the latter who interpreted the work, and could discover meanings that the artist did not even know. Avant-gardism rejected the traditional methods of optical representation — Renaissance perspective — to vindicate the two-dimensionality of painting and the autonomous character of the image, which implied the abandonment of space and light contrasts. In their place, light and shadow would no longer be instruments of a technique of spatial representation, but integral parts of the image, of the conception of the work as a homogeneous whole. On the other hand, other artistic methods such as photography, film and video had a notable influence on the art of this century, as well as, in relation to light, the installation, one of the variants of which is light art. On the other hand, the new interrelationship with the spectator means that the artist does not reflect what he sees, but lets the spectator see his vision of reality, which will be interpreted individually by each person.Advances in artificial light (carbon and tungsten filaments, neon lights) led society in general to a new sensitivity to luminous impacts and, for artists in particular, to a new reflection on the technical and aesthetic properties of the new technological advances. Many artists of the new century experimented with all kinds of lights and their interrelation, such as the mixture and interweaving of natural and artificial lights, the control of the focal point, the dense atmospheres, the shaded or transparent colors and other types of sensorial experiences, already initiated by the impressionists but which in the new century acquired a category of their own. Avant-garde. The emergence of the avant-garde at the turn of the century brought a rapid succession of artistic movements, each with a particular technique and a particular vision of the function of light and color in painting: fauvism and expressionism were heirs of post-impressionism and treated light to the maximum of its saturation, with strong chromatic contrasts and the use of complementary colors for shadows; cubism, futurism and surrealism had in common a subjective use of color, giving primacy to the expression of the artist over the objectivity of the image.. One of the first movements of the 20th century concerned with light and, especially, color, was Fauvism (1904-1908). This style involved experimentation in the field of color, which was conceived in a subjective and personal way, applying emotional and expressive values to it, independent of nature. For these artists, colors had to generate emotions, through a subjective chromatic range and brilliant workmanship. In this movement a new conception of pictorial illumination arose, which consisted in the negation of shadows; the light comes from the colors themselves, which acquire an intense and radiant luminosity, whose contrast is achieved through the variety of pigments used.Fauvist painters include Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, Raoul Dufy, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck and Kees van Dongen. Perhaps the most gifted was Matisse, who \"discovered\" light in Collioure, where he understood that intense light eliminates shadows and highlights the purity of colors; from then on he used pure colors, to which he gave an intense luminosity. According to Matisse, \"color contributes to expressing light, not its physical phenomenon but the only light that exists in fact, that of the artist\\'s brain\". One of his best works is Luxury, Calm and Voluptuousness (1904, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris), a scene of bathers on the beach illuminated by intense sunlight, in a pointillist technique of juxtaposed patches of pure and complementary colors.. Related to this style was Pierre Bonnard, who had been a member of the Nabis, an intimist painter with a predilection for the female nude, as in his Nude against the light (1908, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), in which the woman\\'s body is elaborated with light, enclosed in a space formed by the vibrant light of a window sifted by a blind.. Expressionism (1905-1923) emerged as a reaction to impressionism, against which they defended a more personal and intuitive art, where the artist\\'s inner vision — the \"expression\" — prevailed over the representation of reality — the \"impression\" —. In their works they reflected a personal and intimate theme with a taste for the fantastic, deforming reality to accentuate the expressive character of the work. Expressionism was an eclectic movement, with multiple tendencies in its midst and a diverse variety of influences, from post-impressionism and symbolism to fauvism and cubism, as well as some aniconic tendencies that would lead to abstract art (Kandinski). Expressionist light is more conceptual than sensorial, it is a light that emerges from within and expresses the artist\\'s mentality, his consciousness, his way of seeing the world, his subjective \"expression\".. With precedents in the figures of Edvard Munch and James Ensor, it was formed mainly around two groups: Die Brücke (Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde) and Der Blaue Reiter (Vasili Kandinski, Franz Marc, August Macke, Paul Klee). Other exponents were the Vienna Group (Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka) and the School of Paris (Amedeo Modigliani, Marc Chagall, Georges Rouault, Chaïm Soutine). Edvard Munch was linked in his beginnings to symbolism, but his early work already reflects a certain existential anguish that will lead him to a personal painting of strong psychological introspection, in which light is a reflection of the emptiness of existence, of the lack of communication and of the subordination of physical reality to the artist\\'s inner vision, as can be seen in the faces of his characters, with a spectral lighting that gives them the appearance of automatons. The members of Die Brücke (\"The Bridge\") — especially Kirchner, Heckel and Schmidt-Rottluff — developed a dark, introspective and anguished subject matter, where form, color and light are subjective, resulting in tense, unsettling works that emphasize the loneliness and rootlessness of the human being. The light in these artists is not illuminating, it does not respond to physical criteria, as can be seen in Erich Heckel and Otto Müller playing Kirchner\\'s chess (1913, Brücke Museum Berlin), where the lamp on the table does not radiate light and constitutes a strange object, alien to the scene. Der Blaue Reiter (\"The Blue Rider\") emerged in Munich in 1911 and more than a common stylistic stamp shared a certain vision of art, in which the creative freedom of the artist and the personal and subjective expression of his works prevailed. It was a more spiritual and abstract movement, with a technical predilection for watercolor, which gave his works an intense chromatism and luminosity.. Cubism (1907-1914) was based on the deformation of reality by destroying the spatial perspective of Renaissance origin, organizing space according to a geometric grid, with simultaneous vision of objects, a range of cold and muted colors, and a new conception of the work of art, with the introduction of collage. It was the first movement that dissociated light from reality, by eliminating the tangible focus that in all the previous history of painting illuminated the pictures, whether natural or artificial; in its place, each part of the picture, each space that has been deconstructed into geometric planes, has its own luminosity. Jean Metzinger, in On Cubism (1912), wrote that \"beams of light and shadows distributed in such a way that one engenders the other plastically justify the ruptures whose orientation creates the rhythm\".The main figure of this movement was Pablo Picasso, one of the great geniuses of the 20th century, along with Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. Before ending up in cubism, Picasso went through the so-called blue and rose periods: in the first one, the influence of El Greco can be seen in his elongated figures of dramatic appearance, with profiles highlighted by a yellowish or greenish light and shadows of thick black brushstrokes; in the second one, he deals with kinder and more human themes, being characteristic the scenes of figures immersed in empty landscapes of luminous appearance. His cubist stage is divided into two phases: in \"analytical cubism\" he focused on portraits and still lifes, with images broken down into planes in which light loses its modeling and volume-defining character to become a constructive element that emphasizes contrast, giving the image an iridescent appearance; in \"synthetic cubism\" he expanded the chromatic range and included extra-pictorial elements, such as texts and fragments of literary works. After his cubist stage, his most famous work is Guernica, entirely elaborated in shades of gray, a night scene illuminated by the lights of a light bulb in the ceiling — shaped like a sun and an eye at the same time — and of a quinque in the hands of the character leaning out of the window, with a light constructed by planes that serve as counterpoints of light in the midst of darkness.A movement derived from Cubism was Orphism, represented especially by Robert Delaunay, who experimented with light and color in his abstracting search for rhythm and movement, as in his series on the Eiffel Tower or in Field of Mars. The Red Tower, where he decomposes light into the colors of the prism to diffuse it through the space of the painting. Delaunay studied optics and came to the conclusion that \"the fragmentation of form by light creates planes of colors\", so in his work he explored with intensity the rhythms of colors, a style he called \"simultaneism\" taking the scientific concept of simultaneous contrasts created by Chevreul. For Delaunay, \"painting is, properly speaking, a luminous language\", which led him in his artistic evolution towards abstraction, as in his series of Windows, Disks and Circular and Cosmic Forms, in which he represents beams of light elaborated with bright colors in an ideal space.. Another style concerned with optical experimentation was Futurism (1909-1930), an Italian movement that exalted the values of the technical and industrial progress of the 20th century and emphasized aspects of reality such as movement, speed and simultaneity of action. Prominent among its ranks were Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini, Carlo Carrà and Umberto Boccioni. These artists were the first to treat light in an almost abstract way, as in Boccioni\\'s paintings, which were based on pointillist technique and the optical theories of color to carry out a study of the abstract effects of light, as in his work The City Rises (1910-1911, Museum of Modern Art, New York). Boccioni declared in 1910 that \"movement and light destroy the matter of objects\" and aimed to \"represent not the optical or analytical impression, but the psychic and total experience\". Gino Severini evolved from a still pointillist technique towards Cubist spatial fragmentation applied to Futurist themes, as in his Expansión de la luz (1912, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), where the fragmentation of color planes contributes to the construction of plastic rhythms, which enhances the sensation of movement and speed. Carlo Carrà elaborated works of pointillist technique in which he experimented with light and movement, as in La salida del teatro (1909, private collection), where he shows a series of pedestrians barely sketched in their elemental forms and elaborated with lines of light and color, while in the street artificial lights gleam, whose flashes seem to cut the air. Balla synthesized neo-Impressionist chromaticism, pointillist technique and cubist structural analysis in his works, decomposing light to achieve his desired effects of movement. In La jornada del operario (1904, private collection), he divided the work into three scenes separated by frames, two on the left and one on the right of double size. They represent dawn, noon and twilight, in which he depicts various phases of the construction of a building, consigning a day\\'s work; the two parts on the left are actually a single image separated by the frame, but with a different treatment of light for the time of day. In Arc Lamp (1911-1912, Museum of Modern Art, New York) he made an analytical study of the patterns and colors of a beam of light, an artificial light in conflict with moonlight, in a symbolism in which the electric light represents the energy of youth as opposed to the lunar light of classicism and romanticism. In this work the light seems to be observed under a microscope, from the incandescent center of the lamp sprouts a series of colored arrows that gradually lose chromatism as they move away from the bright focus until they merge with the darkness. Balla himself stated that \"the splendor of light is obtained by bringing pure colors closer together. This painting is not only original as a work of art, but also scientific, since I sought to represent light by separating the colors that compose it\".Outside Italy, Futurism influenced various parallel movements such as English Vorticism, whose best exponent was Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson, a painter who showed a sensitivity for luminous effects reminiscent of Severini, as seen in his Starry Shell (1916, Tate Gallery, London); or Russian Rayonism, represented by Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova, a style that combined the interest in light beams typical of analytical cubism with the radiant dynamism of futurism, although it later evolved towards abstraction.. In Italy also emerged the so-called metaphysical painting, considered a forerunner of surrealism, represented mainly by Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà. Initially influenced by symbolism, De Chirico was the creator of a style opposed to futurism, more serene and static, with certain reminiscences of classical Greco-Roman art and Renaissance linear perspective. In his works he created a world of intellectual placidity, a dreamlike space where reality is transformed for the sake of a transcendent evocation, with spaces of wide perspectives populated by figures and isolated objects in which a diaphanous and uniform illumination creates elongated shadows of unreal aspect, creating an overwhelming sensation of loneliness. In his urban spaces, empty and geometrized, populated by faceless mannequins, the lights and shadows create strong contrasts that help to enhance the dreamlike factor of the image. Another artist of this movement is Giorgio Morandi, author of still lifes in which chiaroscuro has a clear protagonism, in compositions where light and shadow play a primordial role to build an unreal and dreamlike atmosphere. With abstract art (1910-1932) the artist no longer tries to reflect reality, but his inner world, to express his feelings. The art loses all real aspect and imitation of nature to focus on the simple expressiveness of the artist, in shapes and colors that lack any referential component. Initiated by Vasili Kandinski, it was developed by the neoplasticist movement (De Stijl), with figures such as Piet Mondrian and Theo Van Doesburg, as well as Russian Suprematism (Kazimir Malevich). The presence of light in abstract art is inherent to its evolution, because although this movement dispenses with the theme in his works, it is no less true that it is part of this, after all, the human being cannot detach himself completely from the reality that shapes his existence. The path towards abstraction came from two paths: one of a psychic-emotive character originated by symbolism and expressionism, and the other objective-optical derived from fauvism and cubism. Light played a special role in the second one, since starting from the cubist light beams it was logical to reach the isolation of them outside the reality that originates them and their consequent expression in abstract forms.In abstract art, light loses the prominence it has in an image based on natural reality, but its presence is still perceived in the various tonal gradations and chiaroscuro games that appear in numerous works by abstract artists such as Mark Rothko, whose images of intense chromaticism have a luminosity that seems to radiate from the color of the work itself. The pioneer of abstraction, Vasili Kandinski, received the inspiration for this type of work when he woke up one day and saw one of his paintings in which the sunlight was shining brightly, diluting the forms and accentuating the chromaticism, which showed an unprecedented brightness; he then began a process of experimentation to find the perfect chromatic harmony, giving total freedom to color without any formal or thematic subordination. Kandinski\\'s research continued with Russian suprematism, especially with Kazimir Malevich, an artist with post-impressionist and fauvist roots who later adopted cubism, leading to a geometric abstraction in which color acquires special relevance, as shown in his Black on Black (1913) and White on White (1919).. In the interwar period, the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement emerged in Germany, which returned to realistic figuration and the objective representation of the surrounding reality, with a marked social and vindictive component. Although they advocated realism, they did not renounce the technical and aesthetic achievements of avant-garde art, such as Fauvist and expressionist coloring, Futurist \"simultaneous vision\" or the application of photomontage to painting. In this movement, the urban landscape, populated with artificial lights, played a special role. Among its main representatives were Otto Dix, George Grosz, and Max Beckmann.. Surrealism (1924-1955) placed special emphasis on imagination, fantasy and the world of dreams, with a strong influence of psychoanalysis. Surrealist painting moved between figuration (Salvador Dalí, Paul Delvaux, René Magritte, Max Ernst) and abstraction (Joan Miró, André Masson, Yves Tanguy, Paul Klee). René Magritte treated light as a special object of research, as is evident in his work The Empire of Lights (1954, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), where he presents an urban landscape with a house surrounded by trees in the lower part of the painting, immersed in a nocturnal darkness, and a daytime sky furrowed with clouds in the upper part; in front of the house there is a street lamp whose light, together with that of two windows on the upper floor of the house, is reflected in a pond located at the foot of the house. The contrasting day and night represent waking and sleeping, two worlds that never come to coexist.. Dalí evolved from a formative phase in which he tried different styles (impressionism, pointillism, futurism, cubism, fauvism) to a figurative surrealism strongly influenced by Freudian psychology. In his work he showed a special interest in light, a Mediterranean light that in many of his works bathes the scene with intensity: The Bay of Cadaqués (1921, private collection), The Phantom Chariot (1933, Nahmad collection, Geneva), Solar Table (1936, Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam), Composition (1942, Tel Aviv Museum of Art). It is the light of his native Empordà, a region marked by the tramuntana wind, which, according to Josep Pla, generates a \"static, clear, shining, sharp, glittering\" light. Dalí\\'s treatment of light is generally surprising, with singular fantastic effects, contrasts of light and shadow, backlighting and countershadows, always in continuous research of new and surprising effects. Towards 1948 he abandoned avant-gardism and returned to classicist painting, although interpreted in a personal and subjective way, in which he continues his incessant search for new pictorial effects, as in his \"atomic stage\" in which he seeks to capture reality through the principles of quantum physics. Among his last works stand out for their luminosity: Christ of Saint John of the Cross (1951, Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow), The Last Supper (1955, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C.), The Perpignan Station (1965, Museum Ludwig, Cologne) and Cosmic Athlete (1968, Zarzuela Palace, Madrid).. Joan Miró reflected in his works a light of magical and at the same time telluric aspect, rooted in the landscape of the countryside of Tarragona that was so dear to him, as is evident in La masía (1921-1922, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C.), illuminated by a twilight that bathes the objects in contrast with the incipient darkness of the sky. In his work he uses flat and dense colors, in preferably nocturnal environments with special prominence of empty space, while objects and figures seem bathed in an unreal light, a light that seems to come from the stars, for which he felt a special devotion.In the United States, between the 1920s and 1930s, several figurative movements emerged, especially interested in everyday reality and life in cities, always associated with modern life and technological advances, including artificial lights in streets and avenues as well as commercial and indoor lights. The first of these movements was the Ashcan School, whose leader was Robert Henri, and where George Wesley Bellows and John French Sloan also stood out. In opposition to American Impressionism, these artists developed a style of cold tones and dark palette, with a theme centered on marginalization and the world of nightlife. This school was followed by the so-called American realism or American Scene, whose main representative was Edward Hopper, a painter concerned with the expressive power of light, in urban images of anonymous and lonely characters framed in lights and deep shadows, with a palette of cold colors influenced by the luminosity of Vermeer. Hopper took from black and white cinema the contrast between light and shadow, which would be one of the keys to his work. He had a special predilection for the light of Cape Cod (Massachusetts), his summer resort, as can be seen in Sunlight on the Second Floor (1960, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). His scenes are notable for their unusual perspectives, strong chromaticism and contrasts of light, in which metallic and electrifying glows stand out. In New York Cinema (1939, Museum of Modern Art, New York) he showed the interior of a cinema vaguely illuminated by — as he himself expressed in his notebook — \"four sources of light, with the brightest point in the girl\\'s hair and in the flash of the handrail\". On one occasion, Hopper went so far as to state that the purpose of his painting was none other than to \"paint sunlight on the side wall of a house.\" One critic defined the light in Hopper\\'s mysterious paintings as a light that \"illuminates but never warms,\" a light at the service of his vision of the desolate American urban landscape. Latest trends. Since the Second World War, art has undergone a vertiginous evolutionary dynamic, with styles and movements following each other more and more rapidly in time. The modern project originated with the historical avant-gardes reached its culmination with various anti-material styles that emphasized the intellectual origin of art over its material realization, such as action art and conceptual art. Once this level of analytical prospection of art was reached, the inverse effect was produced — as is usual in the history of art, where different styles confront and oppose each other, the rigor of some succeeding the excess of others, and vice versa — and a return was made to the classical forms of art, accepting its material and esthetic component, and renouncing its revolutionary and society-transforming character. Thus postmodern art emerged, where the artist shamelessly transits between different techniques and styles, without a vindictive character, and returns to artisanal work as the essence of the artist.. The first movements after the war were abstract, such as American abstract expressionism and European informalism (1945-1960), a set of trends based on the expressiveness of the artist, who renounces any rational aspect of art (structure, composition, preconceived application of color). It is an eminently abstract art, where the material support of the work becomes relevant, which assumes the leading role over any theme or composition. Abstract expressionism — also called action painting — was characterized by the use of the dripping technique, the dripping of paint on the canvas, on which the artist intervened with various tools or with his own body. Among its members, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko stand out. In addition to pigments, Pollock used glitter and aluminum enamel, which stands out for its brightness, giving his works a metallic light and creating a kind of chiaroscuro. For his part, Rothko worked in oil, with overlapping layers of very fluid paint, which created glazes and transparencies. He was especially interested in color, which he combined in an unprecedented way, but with a great sense of balance and harmony, and used white as a base to create luminosity. European informalism includes various currents such as tachism, art brut and matter painting. Georges Mathieu, Hans Hartung, Jean Fautrier, Jean Dubuffet, Lucio Fontana and Antoni Tàpies stand out. The latter developed a personal and innovative style, with a mixed technique of crushed marble powder with pigments, which he applied on the canvas to later carry out various interventions by means of grattage. He used to use a dark coloring, almost \"dirty\", but in some of his works (such as Zoom, 1946), he added a white from Spain that gave it a great luminosity.. Among the last movements especially concerned with light and color was op-art (optical art, also called kinetic or kinetic-luminescent), a style that emphasized the visual aspect of art, especially optical effects, which were produced either by optical illusions (ambiguous figures, persistent images, moiré effect), or by movement or play of light. Victor Vasarely, Jesús Rafael Soto and Yaacov Agam stood out. The technique of these artists is mixed, transcending canvas or pigment to incorporate metallic pieces, plastics and all kinds of materials; in fact, more than the material substrate of the work, the artistic matter is light, space and movement. Vasarely had a very precise and elaborate way of working, sometimes using photographs that he projected onto the canvas by means of slides, which he called \"photographisms\". In some works (such as Eridan, 1956) he investigated with the contrasts between light and shadow, reaching high values of light achieved with white and yellow. His Cappella series (1964) focused on the opposition between light and dark combined with shapes. The Vega series (1967) was made with aluminum paint and gold and silver glitter, which reverberated the light. Soto carried out a type of serial painting influenced by dodecaphonism, with primary colors that stand out for their transparency and provoke a strong sensation of movement. Agam, on the other hand, was particularly interested in chromatic combinations, working with 150 different colors, in painting or sculpture-painting.Among the figurative trends is pop art (1955-1970), which emerged in the United States as a movement to reject abstract expressionism. It includes a series of authors who returned to figuration, with a marked component of popular inspiration, with images inspired by the world of advertising, photography, comics, and mass media. Roy Lichtenstein, Tom Wesselmann, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol stood out. Lichtenstein was particularly inspired by comics, with paintings that look like vignettes, sometimes with the typical graininess of printed comics. He used flat inks, without mixtures, in pure colors. He also produced landscapes, with light colors and great luminosity. Wesselmann specialized in nudes, generally in bathrooms, with a cold and aseptic appearance. He also used pure colors, without tonal gradations, with sharp contrasts. Rosenquist had a more surrealist vein, with a preference for consumerist and advertising themes. Warhol was the most mediatic and commercial artist of this group. He used to work in silkscreen, in series ranging from portraits of famous people such as Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe or Mao Tse-tung to all kinds of objects, such as his series of Campbell\\'s soup cans, made with a garish and strident colorism and a pure, impersonal technique.Abstraction resurfaced between the 1960s and 1980s with Post-painterly abstraction and Minimalism. Post-painterly abstraction (also called \"New Abstraction\") focused on geometrism, with an austere, cold and impersonal language, due to an anti-anthropocentric tendency that could be glimpsed in these years in art and culture in general, also present in pop-art, a style with which it coexisted. Thus, post-pictorial abstraction focuses on form and color, without making any iconographic reading, only interested in the visual impact, without any reflection. They use striking colors, sometimes of a metallic or fluorescent nature. Barnett Newman, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly and Kenneth Noland stand out. Minimalism was a trend that involved a process of dematerialization that would lead to conceptual art. They are works of marked simplicity, reduced to a minimum motif, refined to the initial approach of the author. Robert Mangold and Robert Ryman stand out, who had in common the preference for monochrome, with a refined technique in which the brushstroke is not noticed and the use of light tones, preferably pastel colors.Figuration returned again with hyperrealism — which emerged around 1965 — a trend characterized by its superlative and exaggerated vision of reality, which is captured with great accuracy in all its details, with an almost photographic aspect, in which Chuck Close, Richard Estes, Don Eddy, John Salt, and Ralph Goings stand out. These artists are concerned, among other things, with details such as glitter and reflections in cars and shop windows, as well as light effects, especially artificial city lights, in urban views with neon lights and the like. Linked to this movement is the Spaniard Antonio López García, author of academic works but where the most meticulous description of reality is combined with a vague unreal aspect close to magical realism. His urban landscapes of wide atmospheres stand out (Madrid sur, 1965-1985; Madrid desde Torres Blancas, 1976-1982), as well as images with an almost photographic aspect such as Mujer en la bañera (1968), in which a woman takes a bath in an atmosphere of electric light reflected on the bathroom tiles, creating an intense and vibrant composition.Another movement especially concerned with the effects of light has been neo-luminism, an American movement inspired by American luminism and the Hudson River School, from which they adopt its majestic skies and calm water marinas, as well as the atmospheric effects of light rendered in subtle gradations. Its main representatives are: James Doolin, April Gornik, Norman Lundin, Scott Cameron, Steven DaLuz and Pauline Ziegen.Since 1975, postmodern art has predominated in the international art scene: it emerged in opposition to the so-called modern art, it is the art of postmodernity, a socio-cultural theory that postulates the current validity of a historical period that would have surpassed the modern project, that is, the cultural, political and economic roots of the Contemporary Age, marked culturally by the Enlightenment, politically by the French Revolution and economically by the Industrial Revolution. These artists assume the failure of the avant-garde movements as the failure of the modern project: the avant-garde intended to eliminate the distance between art and life, to universalize art; the postmodern artist, on the other hand, is self-referential, art speaks of art, and does not intend to do social work. Postmodern painting returns to the traditional techniques and themes of art, although with a certain stylistic mixification, taking advantage of the resources of all the preceding artistic periods and intermingling and deconstructing them, in a procedure that has been baptized as \"appropriationism\" or artistic \"nomadism\". Individual artists such as Jeff Koons, David Salle, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Julian Schnabel, Eric Fischl or Miquel Barceló stand out, as well as various movements such as the Italian trans-avant-garde (Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Nicola De Maria, Mimmo Paladino), German Neo-Expressionism (Anselm Kiefer, Georg Baselitz, Jörg Immendorff, Markus Lüpertz, Sigmar Polke), Neo-Mannerism, free figuration, among others.

      "{'input': ' Traditional nightlife. Origins. Predecessors of modern nightlife were the kafanas, oriental style bistros. The very first one in Belgrade was opened during the Ottoman period, in 1522, in Dorćol. Believed to be the oldest such venue in Europe, it served only Turkish coffee. This was only a year after the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade, and 33 years before the first kafana was opened in Istanbul in 1555. There are no historical sources to why Belgrade was so important at the time to have such venue so early. Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Belgrade in 1661 and counted 21 khans and 6 caravanserais. The largest, Caravanserai of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had \"160 chimneys\", and some had harem sections. When Austrians conquered Belgrade in 1718, among other reports to the imperial court in Vienna, they sent a report on kafanas naming them: \"Crni orao\", \"Crveni petao\", \"Pet ševa\", \"Tri zeca\", \"Divlji čovek\", etc. They especially addressed the problematic \"Kod dve bule\", notorious favorite place of the \"debauched\" Baron Franz von der Trenck.Belgrade remained rich in kafanas in this period as there were almost 200 kafanas and meyhanas, so production of alcoholic beverages in the city bloomed to meet the demand. Austrian governor, Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, was known for his love of the night life. He abolished all taxes on drink serving, and business blossomed. There were some 140 kafanas and pubs in the German section of the city, and over 200 in the Serbian sector. The former mostly served beer, and the latter wine and rakia. In the 1717-1723 period, four breweries were opened in Belgrade. Duke also organized balls in his palace. In the periods when the balls were organized, music in other parts of the city was forbidden. Common citizens were sometimes forcefully dragged to the balls. where they had to pay the entry fee of 17 kreuzers, which was too high. The aristocracy mostly used the commoners as a laughingstock at the balls, and those who refused to come or made problems at the balls, were jailed and whipped. A massive, lush dinners and feasts, known as traktacije, were organized. They included meals out of reach for the common people, like caviar, octopuses, salted herrings, fried pigeons, hot chocolate or imported wines. After the return of the Ottomans in 1739, this \"baroque blitz\" of Belgrade\\'s nightlife ended.After the recapturing, at the corner of the modern Kralja Petra and Cara Dušana streets, kafana \"Crni orao\", the first such facility with the recorded word kafana in its name, survived. It served coffee and nargile. The object was also important for other reasons. It was also the first brewery in Belgrade, and the first venue to work 24/7. On the floor above dwelled guardsmen, the crew of the fortress\\' Timișoara Gate. As their duty was 24/7, so were the kafana\\'s working hours. The building survived until the Interbellum.White Bear Tavern was opened in the 18th century in the town of Zemun. The building was constructed in the first half of the 17th century and served as caravanserai (khan) at least since 1658. Popular venue stayed in business until the early 1960s. It is the oldest surviving building in urban Belgrade, beside the Belgrade Fortress walls. However, Zemun developed independently from Belgrade and for the most part during history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the House at 10 Cara Dušana Street in Dorćol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.The word kafana, introduced by the Ottomans (qahve hane), was derived from the Persian qahvah–khanah, meaning \"coffee house\". English version appeared for the first time in 1615, published by George Sandys after his travels to Constantinople. Golden age. Prince Alexander Karađorđević codified hospitality objects in 1847, dividing them into mehanas and khans, with former given the rank of craft shops. For a long time venues remained unchanged: clothless tables, loosen chairs and benches, tinplate furnaces fired by the guests themselves, tallow candles or petroleum lamps light. A culture of spending hours in kafanas developed among the lower classes. They discussed daily events, politics, shared funny stories or sang with gusle. But development of westernized venues began, built after the examples in Vienna or Budapest. They became gathering spots for officers, clerks, landowners, and, unlike traditional kafanas, occasionally they had women guests. Princess Ljubica Obrenović was a regular visitor of the fancy \"Manojlova bašta\", in modern Zeleni Venac, where she was having a beer. It was the first Belgrade\\'s kafana to serve beer, starting in 1835. In time, the crumby-type kafanas mostly remained in suburbia.Staying up late was against the law, but people would regularly stay in kafanas after-hours. As Belgrade had no street lights at the time, the mayor Nikola Hristić ordered that every person walking at night must have individual, personal lamp, stipulating high fines. As people coming from the venues at late hours were already breaking the law, they had no lamps, trying to stay unnoticed by the gendarmes. A subculture of bribery developed as for the offenders, when caught, it was less expensive to pay the gendarme than to pay the fine, while the gendarmes were poorly paid anyway.Kafanas became centers of city\\'s social life, as the entire political and cultural pulse of the city radiated from them. Some historians described them as the \"most important institutions\" from the 19th century to World War II. Prince Mihailo Obrenović also codified them in 1863, and ordered that women were not allowed to own the kafana nor to work in the village and road ones, but one, or exceptionally two, could work in city kafanas. The venues diversified into various types: mehana, bistro, gostionica, han, saraj, lokal, krčma, bircuz, birtija and later also restoran, hotel, etc. Though all of them offered drinks, some were also offering food, rest and sleepover. Also, many had music. At the end of the 19th century, downtown Makedonska Street had 40 houses, of which 22 were kafanas. Kafanas were generally diversified: some served only coffee, other served only beer or offered only bean soup. Another codification, this time by the municipality, followed in 1877. Kafanas were categorized - kafanas of the first order were allowed to have one female waitress.As hubs of the social life, kafanas soon diversified: \"Esnafska kafana\" (for craftsmen - bricklayers, masons, well diggers, carpenters, sawyers), \"Makedonija\" (farmers and traders), \"Kod Albanije\" (leaseholders), etc. Depending on the political affiliation of the guests, some kafanas turned into the debate clubs of the Serbian Progressive Party, People\\'s Radical Party or Liberal Party. \"Rajić\" was the first kafana where modern ćevapčići were prepared c.1860. Staple of the Serbian cuisine today, they were so popular that at one moment there were 300 ćevabdžinicas (ćevapčići grill shops) in Belgrade. Fully named \"Kod Rajića junaka serbskog\", it hosted the festivities after the complete withdrawal of the Ottomans from Belgrade in 1867, organized by the prince Mihailo. The first hotel, \"Kod jelena\", was built in 1843 but became known as \"Staro zdanje\". It introduced European tradition in entertainment and had the first ballroom in Belgrade. The first ball in Belgrade was held in 1838. They became more frequent after 1860 and had a strict timetable and etiquette. Opposed to this, the vogue of so-called \"potato balls\" spread among the lower classes, especially in the suburban kafanas. They were named that way as, opposed to the distinguished dances of the rich, at these dance party surrogates people were just jumping and jerking, as if they were kicking potato sacks.The first kafana which allowed guests to stay the entire night \"?\", since the mid-19th century, originally only twice a year, after the Christmas and Easter liturgies. Located across the Belgrade\\'s Cathedral Church, it allowed the believers who remained long into the night in the churchyard to stay inside the kafana. On 6 February 1893 the first electrified streetlamp was lit in the city and some chroniclers accept this as the moment when \"proper night life\" began.In 1860 one of the best known kafanas, \"Kod Albanije\", was opened. A modern Palace Albania was built in 1940 on its location. Some of the venues had jovial names, like \"Kod pocepanih gaća\" [Chez Torn Nickers] and \"Sedam Švaba\" [Seven Švabas], or were named after the edifices they were close to (\"Tri šešira\" [Three Hats], because of the Dimović\\'s hat store which occupied the house before and had three tin-made hats above the entrance; \"Kod palidrvca\" [Chez Matchstick], because of the nearby match factory). Kafana \"Amerika\" was known for Turkish delight, chickpeas and čočeks, but also for introducing belly dancers and was notorious for prostitution. Hotel and restaurant \"Balkan\" on Terazije was built in 1935 on the location of the former \"Simina kafana\" from 1860. Ranked as the highest category 1, it was a meeting place of the businesspeople, and was one of the few here women were allowed to work. \"Zlatni krst\", also in Terazije, advertised itself in 1862 as having \"12 rooms and stable for 30 horses\".A custom of unusual, exotic and funny names continued, often countering some neighboring or well established venue: \"Pivni izvor\" [Beer Spring], \"Bosfor\" [Bosporus] (next to \"Dardaneli\" [Dardanelles]), \"Engleska kraljica\" [Queen of England], \"Zemljotres\" [Earthquake], \"Crna mačka\" [Black Cat] (next to \"Bela mačka\" [White Cat]), \"Žurka\" [Party], \"Kod tri seljaka\" [Chez Three Peasants], \"Astronomska kugla\" [Astronomy Ball], \"Kod bombardovanja Beograda\" [Chez Bombing of Belgrade], \"Gusarski brod\" [Pirate Ship], \"Dva panja\" [Two Logs], \"Jeftinoća\" [Cheapness], \"Musa Kesedžija\", \"Radosan Srbin\" [Joyful Serb], \"Srpski vlakovođa\" [Serbian Train Driver], \"Crni Arapin\" [Black Arab], \"U modrim šumama\" [In Blue Forests], \"Kod dve misterije\" [Chez Two Mysteries], \"Kod Oroza\" [Chez Trigger], \"Vrući gavran\" [Hot Raven], \"Izgubljeno jagnje\" [Lost Lamb] or \"Kod žirafu vanevropsku zverku\" [Chez giraffe, out-of-Europe beast].One of the most distinguished venues was \\'\"Srpska kruna\", built in 1869 and adapted into the hotel. It originated in 1853 at the corner of Knez Mihailova and Pariska streets. It was famous for its balls. Built by prince Alexander Karađorđević, it was sold to the Belgrade administration which moved in. The new building, located across the Kalemegdan Park, today hosts the Belgrade City Library. It was part of the colloquially styled \"Kalemegdan group of hotels\", due to their location. The venues began to develop after 1867 and full withdrawal of the Ottomans from the city. The group included the \"Nacional\" inn, later also a hotel, built in 1868. \"Srpska kruna\" architecturally preserved the appearance of the khan - squared, central inner yard - but in modern style. It had only 12 rooms but was famous for its large ceremonial hall, used for the European-style balls and concerts, though every ball had to start with the Serbian folk kolo Srbijanka. \"Dardaneli\" became the most popular kafana after the 1896 reconstruction, a pivot for actors, writers, singing societies, and the central point of city\\'s urban spirit and bohemianism. It was founded in 1855 by Arif Bey, the Turk. Ownership changed a lot, being owned by a Serbian woman Stojana in 1858, as she received it as a dowry. It had billiard tables. Notable regular guests included Vojislav Ilić, Branislav Nušić, Antun Gustav Matoš, Stevan Sremac, Radoje Domanović, Janko Veselinović, Toša Jovanović, Đura Jakšić, and Milovan Glišić. It was affectionately called \"people\\'s university\". When it was to be closed, regular guests organized \"farewell ceremony\" - some 70 people gathered, wearing fedoras and top hats, organized by the famous Bohemian actor Čiča Ilija Stanojević, and performed a dignified farewell \"with great sadness and sorrow\". It was demolished in 1901, a modern National Museum in Belgrade was built instead, so the clientele moved to \"Velika Srbija\" and the already established kafana hub, Skadarlija. At the time, Belgrade was divided into quarters, and the Bibija stream, flowing down the Skadarlija, was an administrative border between the quarters of Palilula and Dorćol. As Palilula limited music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dorćol section to continue with festivities.As \"Velika Srbija\" itself was soon demolished to make way for the \"Hotel Moskva\", Skadarlija became the central nightlife point of Belgrade. As of 2023, \"Tri šešira\", founded in 1864, is the oldest, still operational kafana in Skadarlija and second overall in Belgrade, after the \"?\" from 1823. Even older \"Gospodarska Mehana\", from 1820, was closed in 2013. It was situated close to the mouth of the Topčiderka into the Sava. One of the oldest, \"Grčka Kraljica\", was opened in 1835 and closed in 2007.\"Despotov Han\" inn, predecessor of \"Grčka Kraljica\", holds the infamy as the first recorded brothel in Belgrade, dating from the 1840s. As the prostitution was always illegal, the sex workers had to move to the streets, while the venue continued as regular kafana. The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the Čika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building. The house was demolished much later, in the early 1990s. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903.At the turn of the 19th and the 20th century, Belgrade had one hospitality or catering venue per 50 inhabitants. After World War I, new venues were completely westernized. New hotels, with popular restaurants, were \"Splendid\", \"Astorija\", \"Union\", \"Luksor\", \"Palace\", etc. The social divide remained, though. Members of the lower classes couldn\\'t afford fancy venues, like hotels \"Slavija\" or \"Imperijal\", to order Wiener schnitzel or Hungarian goulash, to listen to German or French singers or to watch magicians, jugglers and other artists. They were visiting small cookshops, soup kitchens and lowest quality venues. Among the most luxurious and exclusive nightlife locales during the Interbellum was \"Srpski Kralj\", at the corner of Uzun-Mirkova and Pariska streets. The lavish hotel was described as an \"ornament\" of the city, with \"equally beautiful interior and exterior\". It was completely destroyed during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. After the war, the state nationalized the lot. Despite several initiatives, it was never rebuilt. Instead, restaurant \"Park\" was opened, with majority of the lot becoming restaurant\\'s garden. It was later renamed to \"Central Park\", before it burned to the ground in December 2012.On 30 December 1927, Ministry of Finance of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes banned night life after 23:00: those who loiter and sit till the late hours, and it is past eleven, will be fined two dinars. Known as the \"tax for nighttime sitting\", it is considered the first official ban of night life in Serbia.Other important, now closed kafanas from this period included: \"Babuna\"; in Senjak, across the modern Belgrade Fair, hosted the monument Pobednik, one of the most recognizable symbols of Belgrade today, before it was erected on the Belgrade Fortress.. \"Bajlonijeva kafana\"; in Skadarlija, owned by the Czech émigré Ignjat Bajloni, right next to his brewery so the air in kafana had the fresh hops aroma. Large venue was known for its beer: dark, light, golden, but also pre-World War II famous foreign brands, like Gambrinus or Stout. Beer was served only in kegs and the venue was famous for its grilled meat. After 1907, it hosted the concerts of the \"Abrašević Choir\", which was founded in 1905.. \"Boem\"; in Cetinjska Street, close to Skadarlija. Very popular during Interbellum, with specific music: schlagers, serenades and arias from operas and operettas.. \"Bulevar\"; in Terazije. The first electrified streetlight in Belgrade was lit in front of it on 6 February 1893. It was popular because of the large hall where parties were organized, including regular concerts of the Serbian-Jewish Singing Society, first fencing tournament in Serbia, shows of the German theatrical groups from Berlin (over 100 shows in 1904 only) and rallies of the political parties. The hall was adapted into the first opera scene in 1909 and the performances were set in collaboration of Branislav Nušić and opera singer Žarko Savić from Zemun. Critics didn\\'t like it, so the scene was closed in 1911. It was still renamed to \"Opera\" later, and was a seat of the comedy-vaudeville theatre \"Orfeum\".. \"Bums Keler\"; in Skadarlija, at the corner with Zetska Street. Until World War I praised as one of the top kafanas in town, with nicely arranged garden, good snacks and excellent wine. Actor Dobrica Milutinović and writer Branislav Nušić for a while lived above the kafana, while actors and singers performed at the venue. The owner was Pera Bums.. \"Cvetkova mehana\"; Cvetko Jovanović opened it in 1902, on the Smederevo road, across the Mali Mokri Lug\\'s farmers\\' market. Originally named \"Vračarsko polje\" after the location, it became known as \"Cvetkova mehana\". The market, and then the neighborhood were named after it, today shortened to only Cvetko.. \"Čukareva kafana\"; existed in the later 19th century at the present location of the Sugar Refinery. A popular venue at the crossroad of the Obrenovac and Šumadija roads, at the entrance into the city, it was named after its owner, Stojko Čukar. It gave name to the modern neighborhood and municipality Čukarica.. \"Dva bela goluba\"; founded by Jovan Kujundžić, a tailor (terzija, cloth tailor). Originally a typical road meyhane, it became so famous that the entire neighborhood and the modern Svetogorska Street were named after it in 1872. In the late 1920s, the Artisan Guild purchased the house and the surrounding lot in order to build the Home of the Artisans, which is today the building of the Radio Belgrade. Kujundžić had one condition, that the name is to be preserved. Because of that, above the entrance into the building, the sculptural composition was carved. It shows two persons with an anvil (symbol of artisans), next to the anvil are scissors (symbol of tailors), with two white doves. The kafana moved to Skadarlija while the restaurant in the new building (finished in 1933) was named \"Zanatski dom\".. \"Dva duda\"; visited by Belgrade\\'s coachmen and porters. It was located close to Tašmajdan.. \"Era Gurman\"; at modern 6 Nikola Pašić Square, where the building of Belgrade City administration is today.

Opened in November 1931 by Ruben Rotinov, it was a venue on \"European level\" and labeled a center of Belgrade\\'s nightlife. It hosted Russian entertainers and singers from all over the world. Originally located at the entry into Skadarlija, it later moved to the main, Kralja Milana Street, where modern \"Polet\" restaurant is.. \"London\"; which gave name to the modern surrounding neighborhood, at the crossroads of the Kneza Miloša and Kralja Milana streets. Built between 1865 and 1873, with hotel rooms above it, kafana\\'s original clientele were the deputies of the nearby National Assembly. Belgrade\\'s first korzo (promenade), formed next to it and down the Topčider Road (today Kneza Miloša). New building was constructed in 1962, but the modernized kafana survived until 1992, joined by the disco-club of the same name in the 1980s. Since 1992 it has been adapted into the branch of the Ponzi scheme of Dafiment Bank, casino, wine club and a supermarket, which all kept the name London.. \"Malo Pristanište\"; small kafana in Savamala. Before World War II, it was the starting point for the boat transport to the other side of the river, and the Nica Beach.. \"Manakova kuća\"; in the Bosanska (now 7 Gavrila Principa) Steeet in Savamala. The house was built for the local Turkish agha and his harem. Cincar merchant Manojlo Manak acquired the house and opened the meyhane and bakery on the ground floor, while he lived upstairs. His cousin Manak Mihailović inherited the house and named the venue after his first name. In the early 20th century he brought a Czech capella, the first all-female music orchestra in Belgrade. The meyhane was closed, but the house survived, was protected by the state in 1963 and declared a cultural monument of great value in 1979.. \"Mostar\"; originally \"Tri ključa\", it was named after the small bridge (most) across the Mokroluški potok, which emptied into the Sava nearby. The wooden bridge was regularly destroyed during the seasonal floods. Kafana gave its name to the modern Mostar neighborhood and the large interchange.. \"Novi Beograd\"; opened in 1924 by Petar Kokotović in the informal suburban settlement of Tošin Bunar. The name was prophetic as the modern municipality New Belgrade was named that way in 1948.. \"Nica\"; located on the sandy beach across the Sava, in the modern Ušće in New Belgrade. It was one of the favorite vacation spots during Interbellum. People were transported from the city by the small boats. Originally only one in the entire string of kafanas along the unurbanized bank (\"Ostend\", \"Zdravlje\", \"Abadžija\", \"Jadran\", \"Krf\", \"Dubrovnik\", \"Adrija\", etc.), it was the only one that survived construction of the King Alexander Bridge in the early 1930s. The beach was to be demolished, too, but it also survived the construction of the bridge, which only made access easier. By this time, it became the largest city beach and was named \"Nica\", after the kafana. The beach was finally closed in 1938 when the construction of the embankment began.. \"Pariz\"; originally \"Ćosina kafana\", founded in the 1830s by Anđelko Alekić Ćosa, who began construction of the new building in 1868.

In its vast yard, which also included stables and quarters for merchants and bullwhackers, the goods and food arriving from the interior were stored and repackaged for the city markets. It survived until the 1920s.. \"Sablja Dimiskija\", or simply \"Dimiskija\"; was the largest kafana at the starting point of Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. It had an outdoor sitting area where well known athletes and local rascals gathered. Later moved to Džordža Vašingtona Street.. \"Slavija\"; original hotel and kafana were built from 1882 to 1888. It had a big party hall and a spacious summer garden. It hosted recitals, theatrical shows and choirs performances.. \"Šiškova kafana\"; one of the oldest kafanas in Belgrade.

It had a good reputation among the city gentlemen, who often visited for \"intimate luncheons\".. \"Topola\"; it was located at the central part of the modern Nikola Pašić Square and popular among the lawyers, who visited with their clients to write claims and complaints. In front of it, the first gas station in Belgrade was opened in 1926.. \"Zeleni Venac\"; at former 1 Gospodska Street. One of the first houses built in the neighborhood, it was rented by Mrs. Hermann from Saxony, young hatmaker\\'s widow. The couple migrated to Belgrade but after her husband\\'s death, she decided to quit the hat making business, rented the house and turned it into the kafana. The venue had no name, but a tin-made green wreath (zeleni venac in Serbian) hanging on the façade. Mrs. Hermann picked the wreath as the kafana faced the cemetery at the time. She established the venue around 1840 and operated it with her daughters. During Interbellum, the name Zeleni Venac spread to the entire neighborhood. Kafana was demolished in the 1960s.. \"Zlatna lađa\"; was built by wealthy merchant Miša Anastasijević. In business until the World War I, it was a meeting place of the merchants and prominent people during the reign of Prince Miloš.. \"Zlatni krst\"; in Terazije, where the first cinema show in Belgrade was held in June 1896. For 25 days, representatives of the \"Brothers Lumiere\" were showing \"photographs made alive by the cinematograph\": L\\'Arrivée d\\'un train en gare de La Ciotat, Démolition d\\'un mur, Baignade en mer, and others. The premiere was attended by king Alexander Obrenović and queen mother Natalie. Prior to that, after the Serbian-Turkish wars from 1876 to 1878, it was the favorite place of the politicians, both liberal and conservative ones. In 1909 the venue moved to Skadarlija and later another kafana, \"Dušanov Grad\", was opened instead on Terazije. By the 21st century, it was turned into the gambling venue.. \"Zlatni šaran\"; located in Jalija, lower section of Dorćol. Close to the Danube, it was well known for its fish meals, and especially famous for its fish broth. Famous mathematician Mihailo Petrović, also known as a passionate fisherman, performed in the venue with his musical group \"Suz\" in the late 19th century.. \"Župa\"; at the curve of the Avala road in Jajinci. Location of the first modern traffic sign placed in Belgrade, the first concrete paved street, and a pitstop in the first races organized in Belgrade. In 2018, a street in the vicinity of its former location was named after the kafana. Zemun. As Zemun was a border town between Austria(-Hungary) and Turkey/Serbia, from 1730 to 1871 there was Kontumac, or the quarantine hospital, on the location of the modern City Park. As Zemun was an important trading post, Kontumac was also a duty-free zone. It contained residential quarters during stay in the zone. Having large number of people in one place, hospitality and catering services developed around the zone, and numerous kafanas were opened: \"Kod zlatnog krsta\", \"Kod zlatnog točka\", \"Kod cara\", \"Kod zlatnog slona\", \"Kod zlatnog sunca\", etc. Modern period. After World War II, night life dwindled. City was heavily damaged, population was cut by half, and it took a while to establish a proper public transportation grid to allow the commuting. Apart from the surviving \"legends\", new kafanas which became centers of night life in the 1950s-1960s were adjoined to the sports clubs and stadiums, like \"Mladi Proleter\", \"Sinđelić\", \"Obilić\" or \"Stadion\". Clientele often included footballers and other athletes. Another hub of night life included riverbank kafanas held by the fishermen, especially in Zemun. Popular entertainment and technological progress also hampered the importance of kafanas. Radio Belgrade began airing non-stop, including immensely popular comedy shows which emptied the streets, like the Joyful Evening (Veselo veče). In 1958 the broadcast of the Television Belgrade began.In the mid-1950s, renovated \"Lotos Bar\" was opened in Zmaj Jovina Street. A basement venue, it offered \"artistic program\" which included magicians, unicycle drivers, jugglers, fire eaters and, as the main attraction, barely dressed female dancers. It became instant sensation. As members of the new Communists political establishment became regular visitors and the bar slipped from not-so-hidden striptease club into the, also not-so-hidden prostitution locale, the working hours were constantly extended. In order to repeal the common people, the entry prices, and especially drinks, skyrocketed. Similar venues soon followed: \"Kristal Bar\", bars in the \"Mažestik\" and \"Metropol\" hotels, and numerous striptease clubs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, all were closed.The street prostitution developed since the late 1960s. The sex workers operated on the access roads to the Pančevo Bridge and became known as stoperke (\"hitchhiker girls\"). As a result, a row of inns was built along the Pančevo and Zrenjanin roads. Another long surviving location was the Economy Faculty\\'s Park, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned a moniker Picin park [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed kamenjarke (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kamenička Street. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinović Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. Another location, which in time became synonymous for prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medaković. Old style brothels also continued, followed in the 1990s by the porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets\", though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution.New Belgrade, built across the Sava in earnest from 1948, notoriously had no night life, as for the long time it had no kafanas. Exceptions were \"Fontana\" in the neighborhood of the same name, \"Pri Majolka\", later renamed \"Vojvodina\", in the shopping mall \"Old Merkator\", and the oldest \"Džakarta\", across the Studentski Grad, better known by its original and present name \"Tošin Bunar\".As the first kafana on the boat, \"Split\" has historical importance as the precursor of splavovi. The restaurant was opened in 1970, but the ship was much older. On the orders of the Serbian Royal Navy Society, it was built in 1892 in Regensburg, Germany, as the luxurious paddle steamer, and originally named Emperor Nicholas II. It was sent mostly on diplomatic missions, like International Danube Commission. It was part of the ill-fated Kladovo transport in World War II. After the war it was renamed Split, docked under the Branko\\'s Bridge, and adapted into the restaurant. The steerage was adapted into the private rooms and used for prostitution, so the police often raided the venue. The ship  is since 1992 on the dry dock in Kladovo, being declared a cultural monument in 2006.In time kafanas evolved into the westernized restaurants, but many traditional ones survived, and remained part of Belgrade\\'s tourist offer. Even today kafanas have been described as the \"soul of Belgrade\". Despite the development of the nightlife in modern sense in the 1960s, and diversification of the fun venues and their modernization to fit the younger population and foreign tourists, in the 2020s Skadarlija remains the second most visited attraction in Belgrade after the Belgrade Fortress, contributing to one third of the city\\'s foreign currency income. Skadarlija. Skadarlija partially preserved the ambience of the traditional urban architecture, including its archaic urban organization, and is known as the main bohemian quarter of Belgrade, similar to Paris\\' Montmartre. As similar Bohemian quarters, Skadarlija and Montmartre twinned on 22 October 1977. It began to develop in 1830 with the settlement of Gypsies in the abandoned trenches in front of the ramparts, followed by the Serbs and the Turks after 1835. An aqueduct, essentially a wall through the center of the street, was later constructed to conduct the stream of Bibijin Potok underground. The largest arch of the aqueduct was named Skadar, so in 1872 the street was named Skadarska Street.Soon after the aqueduct was built, the first khans, precursors of later kafanas, were built along the foothill of the wall. Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901 and demolition of \"Dardaneli\". In the early 20the century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: \"Tri šešira\", \"Dva jelena\", \"Zlatni bokal\", \"Bandist\", \"East\", \"Guild\", \"Vuk Karadžić\", \"Bums Keler\", \"Miloš Obilić\", \"The Two Sergeants\" and \"Mala Pijaca\". The first three still exist, accompanied by newer restaurants like \"Ima dana\" [There Will Be Days], \"Skadarlija\" or \"Dva bela goluba\". In the late 19th century, \"Pašonin Bulevar\" at the beginning of the street, was the very first Belgrade\\'s music hall.The renovation and restoration of Skadarlija began in 1968 in accordance with the designs made by the group of prominent artists. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduced modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of young and bohemian artists. Since 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a \"bohemian flag\". There is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. It includes the types of dishes on the menus, types of uniforms, table clothes or music allowed, and the knowledge of foreign languages. The symbol of Skadarlija is a Fedora hat, mentioned in numerous folk songs, especially the in the starogradska musical style, a form of older urban folk music,  another emblematic feature of Skadarlija.After decades of performing in restaurants and outdoors, some performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers Toma Zdravković, Silvana Armenulić, Olga Jančevecka. Especially popular was Sofka Nikolić. The first folk music star of newly formed Yugoslavia in the 1920s and 1930s, she published dozens of records, becoming one of the most commercial female singers in Europe. Musicians from Europe and United States were visiting her in Skadarlija, including Josephine Baker, who befriended her. Called \"Queen of Skadarlija\", Nikolić withdrew in 1939 when her young daughter, her only child, died. Čubura. Another neighborhood synonymous for bohemian life was Čubura. Like Skadarlija, it was once an outer village-turned-suburb, along the local stream, Čuburski Potok. Differences included the clientele as Skadarlija was considered to be a fancy and fashionable place while Čubura used to be a gathering place of common people, and decades long communal neglect of Čubura compared to constant renovations in Skadarlija, which gave Čubura a certain flavor. In 1941, on the short distance along the Makenzijeva Street there were 30 kafanas. Čubura was described as \"one vast kafana, open all hours\".After 1945, \"Vltava\" (originally named \"Toplica\") became a layer\\'s gathering place, \"Mala Vltava\" of the former political prisoners from the Goli Otok while the more affluent citizens gathered in \"Trandafilović\". \"Orač\" was originally opened in Savinac.

Never a fancy locale, it reached its heyday in the 1970s and got \"frozen in the 1980s\", with traditional interior. It hosted equally bohemian, artistic elite, local population and construction workers from the nearby sites. By the 2010s it regained iconic status of the small, pampered oasis with the younger clientele and foreign visitors, but still was closed on 1 March 2013 as one of the last remaining \"true Belgrade kafanas\".\"Trandafilović\" was founded in 1929, and demolished in 1961 when authorities planned to cut the old plane tree in restaurants yard. After public protests, including poet Libero Markoni who physically prevented workers from cutting the tree, authorities backed off. New building on the same location was finished in 1967 and the kafana moved in again. In the 21st century it was closed and turned into the household chemicals shop. The plane tree survived and under it, a bistro named \"Trandafilović\" was opened. Modern Čubura Park was built where the \"Kikevac\" kafana was located. As it was the central gathering point of the migrants from Crna Trava, the most famous builders in Serbia, a monument dedicated to the nameless \"Crna Trava builder\" was erected in the park in 2019.Unlike preserved Skadarlija, Čubura\\'s bohemianism was completely extinguished by the 2020s. Kafanas were closed one by one and the \"spirit of Čubura\" disappeared. One of the last kafanas, \"Kolubara\", was transformed into the betting facility while the famed \"Čuburska lipa\" was demolished in early 2018.

It was later annexed with several rooms and the great hall which continues into the terrace.

Close to both the Belgrade Main railway station and Belgrade Bus Station, it was always filled with \"interesting faces\". When Savamala became a hipsters center in the 2010s, the buffet\\'s clientele represented mix of \"cultural and non-cultural\" which brought the \"explosion of charm\". Interiors remained unchanged from the 1960s and 1970s, until the hotel was closed in 2018.. \"Grgeč\"; at 62 Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. The original kafana dated from the 19th century and was on the left side of the street. The building was demolished during the World War II bombings. In the late 1950s, the new restaurant was opened across the old location and was given the original name, as it was intended to be a fish restaurant.

Original name is unknown, but after German contractors were given the job of building the neighboring First Town Hospital, it was named \"Kod sedam hrabrih Švaba\" in 1864, and had a drawing of seven drunk Germans chasing a rabbit, above the door. This was a reason why it was closed during the German occupation in World War II.

After the war, it was reopened in the late 1950s as \"Vidin kapija\". It was closed in the mid-2000s, and reopened as ultra-modern club \"Medžik\", designed by Karim Rashid.

In 2002 it was closed and the casino was opened instead. In 2012 another kafana was opened on the same location but was reported as \"face-lifted for new customers\" and as such \"changed to unrecognizability and therefore repulsive to many\".. \"Žagubica\"; not much distinguished, but very popular old-style kafana. Due to its location, at the busy corner of Ruzveltova and 27. Marta (today Kraljice Marije) streets, it became the popular meeting place (\"lets meet at Žagubica\") and the surrounding neighborhood was named after it.

Cultural and historical significance. Historian Dubravka Stojanović singles out kafanas from other institutions of the civil society (salons, clubs, associations), as the first institute of the new society, both in terms of chronology and importance. She described it as the first democratic space for which no \"invitation\" (literacy, membership card, party discipline) was needed. Due to the volatile history in the Balkans, various kafanas served as gathering places and recruitment centers for numerous wars and rebellions: \"Crni Konj\" (Zadarska Street; for individual fighters in the Serbian-Ottoman Wars), \"Kragujevac\" (Karađorđeva Street); Garibalidians, Italian volunteers in the Serbian-Turkish Wars of 1876–1878, \"Zlatni Krst\" (Serbian volunteers for the same conflict), etc.Kafanas were also important for the economy. First public places for drafting contracts and merchant treaties were kafanas. This is why they originally developed around the main merchant areas and old khans. They were socially important as they allowed for the poor classes to participate in economic activities, too. Most important in this sense were \"Zisina kafana\" (opened before 1826 in Savamala), \"Kod Paje kantardžije\" and nearby \"?\". Kafanas hosted numerous firsts in Belgrade: bank (First Serbian Bank, in \"Staro Zdanje\", went bankrupt in 1875), exchange office, labor market, stock exchange (in \"Bosna\", corner of Karađorđeva and Travnička, in 1895), insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio.

This continued after the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, until the new assembly building was finished in 1936. Also hosted performances of the National Theatre in Belgrade until 1920.. 1896 - first public motion picture show in Serbia held in \"Zlatni krst\", on Terazije, on 6 June 1896, with Lumière brothers personally showing the film. King Aleksandar Obrenović was in the audience. The tickets were pricey and the films were screened for the next six months. The Lumière brothers\\' camera remained in Belgrade and is kept at Yugoslav Film Archive.. 1896 - first intercity phone line established from \"Kolarac\" to the city of Niš. On the Belgrade side there was a concert of the vocal ensemble \"Stanković\", while on the Niš side it was a singers\\' society \"Branko\".. 1900s - travelling cinemas began to show movies in \"Kasina\", where the first permanent cinema was opened in 1910.. 1900s - \"Kolarac\" was a regular meeting place of young officers headed by Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, who here plotted the 1903 May Coup, which ended with the deaths of king Alexander and queen Draga, and termination of the Obrenović dynasty in 1903. Also, the first book fair in the city was held here.. 1900s - the first individual public clock in Belgrade was placed in front of the \"Kod Albanije\".. 1905 - elementary school \"Karađorđe\" established in the \"Gavrilović\", which operated as school by day and as kafana in the afternoon and evening. Same thing happened few years later with the elementary school \"Jovan Cvijić\" and the \"Lavadinović\" kafana.. 1910s - members of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, including Gavrilo Princip, gathered in the \"Zlatna Moruna\" and planned their actions, including the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, used by Austro-Hungary as the pretext for World War I.. in time, various neighborhoods of Belgrade or important buildings, were named after the kafanas: Zeleni Venac, London, Lipov Lad, Mostar, Lion, Čukarica, Cvetko, Golf, Gospodarska Mehana, Dva Bela Goluba, Palace Albanija, Ruski Car, Mihajlovac, Žagubica, Park \"Tri ključa\", etc.As of 2023, on the administrative territory of Belgrade, there were 18 former or still operational catering and tourist facilities which were declared cultural monuments: Modern nightlife. Prolonged dance evenings \"till dawn\" (igranke) were the precursors of modern nightlife after World War II. In the new, Communist regime, new types of music became almost obligatory, like the kozaračko kolo, but in the period immediately following the Allied victory this music was mixed with Russian romances, jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. Western music especially became popular after the film Sun Valley Serenade with Glenn Miller\\'s music reached Yugoslav cinemas. Dances included tango, waltz, foxtrot, slowfox, and especially popular trucking, or treskavac in Serbian (\"shaking dance\"). However, with political changes regime\\'s attitude soon switched. By the end of 1945 the American music was labeled as \"capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies\". Accused of undermining discipline and public moral, the trucking was officially banned in the early 1946. By 1951 the state propaganda attacked boogie-woogie (\"eccentric, vulgar and decadent\"), while entire public campaign was orchestrated in 1952 against jazz, which \"influenced the animal sensations\". This first post war period of dance nights lasted from 1945 to 1963.First night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. First rock and roll news can be found in press already in 1956. Public reaction lacked the disputes and rage of the previous types of music, like jazz or contemporary dance in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It appeared that the older generations didn\\'t perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS (\"vocal-instrumental band\").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn\\'t ignore it. One of the pioneer promoters was Nikola Karaklajić, chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. His TV show Concert for crazy young people was the most popular. It premiered in January 1967 and was aired once a month until 1969. Another popular TV show was Maksimetar (1970-1972). Among the printed media, the most influential was Džuboks, which debuted on 3 May 1966. Shy 1960s. Entry in the clubs was free or the fees were symbolic. Some had passes, but they were easily obtained. Still, the security guards had a great latitude letting someone in. People were searched and checked whether they are underage or intoxicated. First clubs were small and located in private houses and apartments with city authorities being bent on closing them. Euridika. Predecessor of the future disco clubs opened in Vračar, in a private house at 33 Molerova Street in 1961, becoming one of the most important cultural hotspots in the late 1960s. The club was an offshoot of the Youth Theater DADOV, founded in 1958. The idea was that, through drinks and dance nights, the money for the theater will be collected. Once a week, a Club of the popular music lovers gathered here. The building itself was built in 1921 and was the pre-war house of the Tomić family. Performers, some of which launched their careers here, included Elipse, Safiri, Zlatni Dečaci, Dobri Drugovi, Crni Biseri, Crni Panteri (founded by the students from Congo Kinshasa), Boba Stefanović, etc.  When Crni Panteri performed Shake Your Hips, the ecstatic audience trashed and broke the furniture. The audience was mostly divided in two groups: the Beatles fans and the Rolling Stones fans. It was closed in the late 1970s. Youth Center - 202. Belgrade Youth Center, at 22 Makedonska Street, was opened in 1964, while Dancing Hall was introduced on 16 October 1966. Live performances included the most popular rock bands of the day, like Siluete, Crni Biseri, Džentlmeni, Zlatni Dečaci. Club had a matinée (15:00-19:00) and night programs (19:30-21:00). It was adapted into the discothèque \"202\" in 1969 in collaboration with Radio Belgrade 202 station which directly broadcast the program from the club. The disco was noted for the lack of problems or incidents and as a meeting place of the children from the wealthy families (\"working class youth almost couldn\\'t be seen in it\"). In the late 1970s, it became the gathering place for the punk enthusiasts. Kod Laze Šećera. First proper disco in Belgrade, \"Kod Laze Šećera\", was opened on 24 April 1967. It was announced that Lord Snowdon would attend the event, but he didn\\'t show up. The venue was located at 17 Ive Lole Ribara Street (today Svetogorska), in the Jevrem Grujić\\'s House, in Stari Grad. It was close to the Atelje 212 theatre, so at the opening almost the entire acting troop was present, so as the dramatists, authors, painters, etc., including Mira Trailović, Jovan Ćirilov, Ivan Tabaković, Dušan Matić. Founder of the disco was Lazar Šećerović, a translator, bon vivant and direct descendant of Jevrem Grujić. At the time of opening, other discos existed only in Paris, London and Milan, while it was 10 years before the famous Studio 54 in New York City was opened. Working hours were from 18:30 to 1:00, chaste compared to the modern times. The music was mostly soul: Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, The Temptations, Dusty Springfield. The venue was small, situated in the basement, but still was a major improvement in the nightlife offer in the city, credited with \"democratization of fun\".The club introduced several other \"firsts\", like girls without male companions, people dancing alone or after parties when selected groups would move to the upper floor for more quiet fun. The club was also called \"Lola\", after the street, and was hailed as the \"only disco between Trieste and Vladivostok\". Guests included members of the international jet-set who visited Belgrade: Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Catherine Deneuve, Judi Dench, Nina Ricci, Omar Sharif, Marisa Berenson, Alain Delon, Claudia Cardinale. During the day, rock bands were practicing in the club. The venue also hosted the first pop art exhibition in Yugoslavia, which included Roy Lichtenstein\\'s graphics and Andy Warhol\\'s lithographs.Opening was supported by the basketball club KK Crvena Zvezda. Though all the necessary permits were obtained, not everything went smooth. Municipal authorities debated about it, and some described it as a \"lair for the young alcoholics, junkies, debauchers and rich kids.\" Owners claimed that the venue is a clean and decent location, adapted with taste which included the green Italian wallpapers and black floor linoleum. They also defended the club naming celebrities who were regular guests: Milena Dravić, Vera Čukić, Arsen Dedić, Branko Pleša, Biljana Nevajda. Neighboring citizens were against the club. They tried administratively to prevent it from being open but when that failed, they sabotaged the venue as they could, like throwing garbage at the guests who were entering the house. Concerns showed to be substantiated in the beginning, as the guests were making loud noise at the entrance and unbridled youngsters, mostly of wealthy parents, were causing too much of a commotion with their cars, vespas and motorbikes. Owners later placed two guards outside who had a specific duty to keep the noise down.The club came under the attack of numerous bans and regulations, including the one which allowed dancing, but banned music. The authorities also accused the club of playing \"enemy music\", of destroying the morality of the Socialist youth and declared it a CIA headquarters in Yugoslavia. Military generals in the state\\'s Supreme Defense Council concluded that club has to be closed. Fighting both the authorities and the neighbors proved too much for the owners, so they closed the club in 1968. Still, it remains as the first such venue in entire Yugoslavia and the wider region of the Communist ruled states. For a while, secret parties continued to be organized. KST. KST, short for \"Klub studenata tehnike\", was unofficially established in 1952 for the students of three technical faculties (architecture, electrical engineering and civil engineering). It was located in one of the laboratories, almost in the basement, at 73 Bulevar Revolucije, today Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. High School for Technical Engineering, to which the faculties were subordinated at the time, made the club official in March 1954 which was used both for studying and dance parties.Disco was opened on 29 February 1968. Originally, it had only one magnetophon. The music was various:  funk, soul, disco, rock and roll, twist, waltz. The club was known for promoting young musicians and some of the most important Yugoslav rock-groups performed here in their early days, like the Riblja Čorba, Poslednja Igra Leptira, Haustor or Partibrejkers. The first \"unplugged\" concert in the Balkans was performed here by the Bijelo Dugme. Many groups recorded albums here. In time, it became \"another house\" for musicians, and the club which \"makes DJs\". The club also organized theatrical and poetry evenings, freshmen welcome parties, fashion shows and the famous pre-New Year\\'s Eve masquerade balls. Performers included greatest stars of Serbian acting, like Ljuba Tadić, Olivera Marković, Snežana Savić, Tanja Bošković, Petar Kralj and Ljuba Moljac. The venue also became an important place for public debates and discussions.The club was always known for the relaxed, home-style dress code (sweaters, hoodies, plaid shirts, no heavy make-up, high heels, tight jackets, etc.). As one of the first students\\' and night clubs in the city, and the only one from this period that still works, KST achieved cult status among the city youth. A 2019 documentary about KST was filmed by Zoran Bulović, commemorating venue\\'s 65th anniversary. SKC. \"Studentski Kulturni Centar\", shortened to SKC, was opened in 1968 at 48 Kralja Milana Street. It was later regarded as the way for Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito to appease the riots which erupted as the 1968 student rebellion. After punk music arrived in Belgrade, the visitors mostly belonged to the punk subculture. In time it became the \"safe haven\" for avant-garde artists and alternative rock music in the 1970s, and the emerging New wave music since the late 1970s, including the regular performances of Idoli, Električni Orgazam and Šarlo Akrobata.It became the central stage of the alternative cultural life in Belgrade and numerous bands began their careers or performed in the venues basements, improvised studios and workshops, next to the most popular bands of the era. The SKC have two main spaces inside: small club on the ground level and larger hall at the first floor. Parts of the building serve as the café and as the bookstore, and the venue also hosts art exhibitions. As of 2023, SKC is still operational. Joyfull 1970s. At the start of the decade the night life for the young was still undeveloped. Reports lamented that, \"unfortunately\", kafanas were still predominant. The alcohol was freely served to the minors, while in some venues dinner was obligatory. Modern kafanas, adapted for the youth, didn\\'t exist. There were only several dance halls where \"better bands\" performed, the rest organized \"typically dilettante and irresponsible\" dance parties. Only few had jukeboxes or other \"automated musical machines\". Most popular disco clubs were \"Youth Center\", \"Go-Go Dancing\" in Tašmajdan and \"Disco Club 202\" in the old synagogue in Zemun. All youth venues had expensive tickets.However, later in the 1970s, Belgrade began to resemble other world metropolises. Numerous internationally important events developed: theatrical festival BITEF, film festival FEST (1970), musical festival BEMUS, Belgrade jazz festival (1973), Belgrade review of Yugoslav film (1973), etc. Regarding night life, fashion or music, everything was generally toned down from the wild 1960s. Major influence came from the Western Europe, mainly through Italy, and was considered as something modern and advanced. Rock and roll was especially popular.By the mid-1970s, disco clubs turned into the exclusive venues and the entry fees became too high, though some included a drink. Drinks, in general, also became expensive as various inspection rarely visited the venues, so visitors smuggled alcohol into the clubs. Though the largest crowds were during weekends, the clubs were open during the entire week, usually having only one non-working day, varying from club to club. Working hours mostly didn\\'t extend after 2 a.m. In order to avoid the intent of the authorities to close them, the clubs secured patronage of some state-owned institution, usually a sport society, and were registered as the \"restaurants with music\". In 1978, a modern caffe bar \"Zlatni papagaj\" was opened in the Đure Jakšića Street. It was planned as the standing bar for quick drinks, so it had no chairs.In the late 1970s, a \"Dijalog\" was opened in Ušće, the first restaurant on the proper boat, as opposed to the later ones opened on the barges. After Slobodan Milošević came to power in the late 1980s, he was interviewed on \"Dijalog\" by The Times correspondent Dessa Trevisan. Crveno i crno. Disco club \"Crveno i crno\" was opened in 1970, in the Miloša Pocerca Street, in West Vračar. It soon achieved the cult status. The club was opened by Dejan Dodig Džamba, with the assistance of the Youth Organization of Savski Venac. Entry was free, but it lasted only for a season and was closed in 1971. Youth Organization tried to open another disco club on the same location by themselves, but they were unsuccessful. Cepelin. In 1971, \"Cepelin\", the best and the most famous disco in Yugoslavia was opened. Some chroniclers consider it the first proper disco club in Belgrade, open to everyone. It was located at 28 Ilije Garašanina Street, in Tašmajdan. Its opening was described as night life\\'s \"excelleration\". At the opening night, state and military top officials and members of the diplomatic corps were present. The caviar was served from the Josip Broz Tito\\'s plates. At the peak of its popularity, \"Cepelin\" had 10,000 members. It had three dance floors, state of the art sound system and the interior was patterned after the famed London club \"La Valbonne\": floors covered with the black artificial leather, dominant brass ornaments, luxurious booths, plush covered armchairs, twenty different types of mirrors, 1,000 colored lightbulbs, and strobe lights above each dance floor. It also had blacklights, projector which emitted psychedelic music videos on the walls which were mostly black. The rooms were stuffy and the colors of the lights changed depending on the DJ who was working that night. Parts of the walls and furniture were in red, with colorful flower prints.The most popular persons in the venue included DJ Mister Čupko, and the head-to-toe tattooed main bouncer, nicknamed Oumpah-pah after the comic book character. Đorđe Božović Giška and his entourage were the regulars. The club was located next to the Fifth Gymnasium and sponsored by the Tašmajdan Sports and Recreation Center. It was opened by Saša Nikolić and had working hours of 16:00-21:00 (matinée, for the minors) and 21:00-24:00, for adults, with strict rules on not allowing the minors to stay during the later program. DJs, including Saša Radosavljević and Raša Petrović, were located in the glass booth above the dance podium. It was renovated and expanded in the mid-1970s and included live performances from the most popular Yugoslav rock bands. Most frequent performers were the Korni Grupa. \"Cepelin\" was closed in 1980. It was closed abruptly, citing renovation. When it was reopened, it was a different venue, renamed to \"Taš\". Akvarijus. Though \"Cepelin\" was unrivaled, \"Akvarijus\" was the only one which could attract some of the \"Cepelin\" visitors. \"Akvarijus\" was located at 7 Deligradska Street near the Slavija Square, in the basement of the painter Radovan Trnavac Mića house. It had mostly fancy clientele with deep pockets (šminkeri), consisting of rich lawyers, politicians and athletes. The clientele differed from the other similar venues as the club was attended by the exclusive members of the city elite (sports, film, fashion) and soon became well known outside of Yugoslavia. Music included Bee Gees, Boney M, Éric Charden, Amanda Lear. Once a week, \"Akvarijus\" was showing animated films.\"Akvarijus\" was opened by Dodig in 1972, after he left \"Crveno i crno\". The club was sponsored by the Radnički Sports Association. Though its name means aquarius, it was actually named after the large aquarium which occupied the central room. As its fashionable visitors mostly had no fixed working hours, so didn\\'t the club: it was open every day, all night. It was small, consisting of three rooms. Central room had a bar, one room was adapted for sitting and third was for dancing. The venue was closed in 1983. Other clubs. \"Crveni Pevac\"; rock place in Topličin Venac, visited by the bikers.. \"F(ilozof)\"; founded in 1975 by the youth organization of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in order to gather funds for educational projects. It was a humble venue, opened 20:00-24:00. A musical haven for the hippies, rockers and alternative music lovers, the music included The Doors, Led Zeppelin, etc.. \"Mažestik\"\\'; opened at the same time as the \"Cepelin\" and also owned by Nikolić. It was opened in the hotel of the same name in Obilićev Venac and was adapted by architect Ilija Gligorijević. It was an exclusive disco club with pricey tickets and a favorite place of šminkeri. Situation later changed. In February 1990, Kristijan Golubović, with Dragan Nikolić Gagi (who was later implicated in the assassination of Željko Ražnatović Arkan), raided the venue, forcing everyone to lay on the ground, firing rapid fire into the ceiling.. \"Monokl\"; opened in bohemian Skadarlija, across the kafana \"Tri šešira\". Silvana Armenulić performed at the opening. DJ was Maksa Ćatović, previously a disc jockey in \"Cepelin\".. \"Resnik\"; opened in the suburb of Resnik, in the former adult movie theater which was closed by the authorities. It wasn\\'t much attended as it was distant from downtown. Rebel 1980s. By this time, DJ\\'s became stars in their own right. The most popular was Zoran Modli. Akademija. At the end of 1981, \"Akademija\" club, one of the most famous and influential in Belgrade, was opened at 53 Knez Mihailova Street, in the dark basement of the Gallery of the Painting Academy, hence the name. It was a rock and roll venue, a meeting place of the rockers, artists, politicians\\' children, young and avant-garde rebels, etc. The original line-up of Ekaterina Velika gathered here (Milan Mladenović, Margita Stefanović, Bojan Pečar). Other musicians who performed included Električni Orgazam, Partibrejkers, Psihomodo Pop, Toni Montano, etc. Visitors of the elite discos avoided it completely as it was considered a \"hole which shocks and provokes\". \"Akademija\" was an important part in the growing up and maturing of generations to come and survived until 2011, when it was finally closed,. Despite the public protests, petitions and online activism from the fans and the celebrities, city refused to help with the situation and the debt-collectors closed the venue.\"Akademija\" is described today as a \"separate state\" during the 1980s, and \"city phenomenon\", West-oriented, which forged a new culture of having fun, influenced by the unique concerts on the stage which was right next to the audience. With the neighboring \"Zvezda\", it was the main gathering point of the Belgrade youth of the decade. They are described as meeting point of two Belgrades - one, which smelled on beer, tobacco and marijuana, and the one with fragrances of the Western perfumes and Italian leather shoes. It was unconceivable at the time that one person would visit both venues. Zvezda. Rivaling club \"Zvezda\" was opposed to \"Akademija\" in every way, including the location: it was right across, at 51 Knez Mihailova Street, at the back entrance into the basement of the Grčka Kraljica restaurant. Opened in 1983, it became the symbol of the fanciness, with diametrically opposite interiors, music and general concept from \"Akademija\". In order to get a membership card for \"Zvezda\", people needed political and other connections, but the best pass was a modern and attractive look. This included expensive imported perfumes and wardrobe. Rivaling clubs were so different, that just by someone\\'s attire, you might guess where they will enter. After \"Zvezda\" was closed, another club, called \"Bassement\" was opened instead in the 2000s, but that club was later closed, too. Duga. Club \"Duga\" was located at 5 Sredačka Street. It was patterned after the wishes of the rich and opened with an idea to gather the rich and famous, pretty girls and show-business stars. It soon achieved a status of the \"club for the famous\". \"Duga\" was opened in 1981 in Zvezdara. It was the most exclusive venue in its time. The club was a rearranged basement of the private house and over 200,000 Deutsche Marks were spent on the adaptation which was work of architect Ilija Gligorijević. It was said that an average, rich customer would \"spend per night as much as a factory worker earns in a year\". However, one visitor ignored the fanciful dress code and artificial manners: legendary actor Zoran Radmilović, who lived in the vicinity, would regularly come in slippers for a coffee. JAT. One of the first barges, opened in the late 1970s. It was originally intended only for the employees of the JAT Airways, but soon became a gathering place for the regular clientele, becoming a famous venue in the city. It was derelict by the 2000s, when it was sold to a private owner. Before it was renovated, the barge detached and was taken by the river downstream. The owner took emergency measures to keep it afloat, but in January 2019 it sank under the heavy snowfall. The river barge itself was considered one of the best, produced in Smederevo. Other clubs. In the mid-1980s, an expansion of new disco clubs began. Best known were:. \"Bezistan\", in Terazije, in the basement of the venue later adapted into the McDonald restaurant which survived until today. Bezistan was different from other discos of the era and was the only \"dancing club\" in the city. When the popularity of the Italo disco reached Belgrade, Bezistan organized dance competitions for participant from the entire Yugoslavia. Band Zana was promoted here, while band Aska practiced choreography for their performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 1982. Bezistan was closed in 1989.. \"Bona fides\", founded by the students of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law.. \"Crveni podijum\", in Kalemegdan; In the mid-1980s, it was advertised as the \"largest open air disco in the Balkans\" as there were up to 10,000 visitors on some nights.. \"Cvetni Breg\", in Resnik.. \"London\", in the neighborhood of the same name.. \"Panorama\", in Košutnjak.. \"Šestica\", on the 6th floor of the Beograđanka building in downtown Belgrade, hence the name [The Six]; It worked from 20:00 to 24:00 and though operational for only three years, it was quite popular as it provided patrons with an excellent view of the city. It was the only club at the time that was not located in an adapted utility room or a basement. Still, though it occupied almost the entire floor, it was notorious for stuffiness, as the highrise\\'s windows couldn\\'t open.. \"Taš\", replaced \"Cepelin\"; It had the so-called \"Chivas booths\", which introduced whiskey as a symbol of prestige in the Belgrade\\'s night life. Knez worked as a DJ in Taš, before he became a popular singer. With \"Duga\" and \"Nana\" made the famous \"triangle\" of Belgrade\\'s night life in the 1980s.The 1980s saw the origins of the splavovi, which will experience a full expansion later in the 1990s: \"Argument\", the first restaurant on splav. Opened in 1983 on Ada Ciganlija, it looked like a \"railroad car\", without any specificities. In the 1990s it was relocated to Ušće. It was later renamed and refurbished, but is still located there. Hence, many city chroniclers take 1983 as the year the splavovi were born.. \"Hua Hua\", also opened in 1983, close to the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija. It was the most popular splav in the 1980s. The venue was sold in 2013.. \"Savski Galeb\", originally opened in 1987, it was the first such facility on the Sava Quay, in Blokovi. It was actually an adapted old freight barge. Criminal 1990s. The 1990s in Serbia were marked with calamities: break-up of Yugoslavia, wars, economic sanctions, collapse of the standard of living. Criminals began occupying the clubs and night life in general. Fashion and aesthetics of the turbo-folk became a norm while shootings and killings in disco clubs became regular events. Turbulent period was marked by the shootouts, murders and executions, often in the popular city clubs. Visiting these venues was a high risk.Disco clubs lost the top position in night fun, as young people turned to the folkotheques (disco clubs with turbo-folk music) and splavovi,  or barge-clubs. Among the most popular barges were \"Lukas\", where singer Aca Lukas started his folk career, assuming the splav\\'s name as his own alias, \"Mozzart\" (which sank after 2000) and \"Triton\". By the time the 1990s ended, the splavovi almost completely covered the banks of the Sava and spread into the Danube. First splavovi open for visitors originated in the late 1970s and the first restaurant, named \"Argument\", was opened in 1983. Barge \"Blek Pantersi\", owned by the music bend of the same name, was opened in 1990. It was popular until it burned in 2008. The splavovi experienced a boom after 1991 and by the 2010s spread for almost 15 km (9.3 mi) along the Sava. As of today, they remain publicly connected with criminals and numerous incidents. By 2021, there were over 200 cafes, restaurants, kafanas and discos on the barges.From the summer of 1996, the splavovi from Ušće spread along the bank of Staro Sajmište, too. The barges in Staro Sajmište were the first where \"urban\" splavovi appeared and the entire sub-culture originating in the venues became mainstream. This barges had \"historical importance\" for the expansion and acceptance of the venues as an authentic part of the Belgrade\\'s nightlife and tourist offering. However, the constant public conflict between the cheap fun and criminal on the barges, and the solemnity of the neighborhood given its war history as a Sajmište concentration camp, continued for decades. Ultimately, all barges were moved out of Staro Sajmište by the late 2010s.Second half of the 1990s saw a development of electronic music venues so as a techno and rave scene with international DJs, despite the international sanctions. A strict division developed, with folk venues on the one, and underground, alternative techno clubs on the other side, with the mainstream rock music almost disappearing. Estrada. The splav opened in 1988 on the Sava Quay under the name \"Pingvin\", which was soon changed. The first purposely built barge-discotheque, it was a blueprint for all the future venues of this type. It was the first barge with a DJ, and a separated dance floor and booths for sitting. It was well visited since the opening, but the clientele changed in time. Originally, it was made from the \"roamers\" from all over the city, but with the general criminalization of the society, it became the gathering point for the members of the criminal clans from Zemun and New Belgrade. Nana. Main rival of Duga\", at 3-a Koste Glavinića Street in Senjak. Originally, it was known as an elegant little nightclub with a more urban and sophisticated atmosphere than \"Duga\". During its \"sophisticated\" days, \"Nana\" was known for not playing folk music. Before the criminals began to gather in it, for a while it was a favorite place of the foreign diplomats as many have residences in Senjak. A venue which had a dress code (obligatory suit since 1987), it was \"discovered\" by the criminals, who began to gather, organizing in local clans. It gained the notoriety of being the first club in which the murder occurred: Andrija Lakonić Laki, unofficially claimed by many to be a police snitch, was murdered in \"Nana\" on 24 March 1990. The murder revealed connections between the criminals and the secret police. Darko Ašanin and Vesko Vukotić were accused. The trial dragged on, with many criminals and policemen appearing, including the inspector Miroslav Bižić, who was accused of hiding the evidence and helping Vukotić to flee the country. The case was never closed. Bižić, who left the police, was assassinated in 1996, while Ašanin was murdered in June 1998. These crimes also remained unsolved.The club was closed and later reopened but became a \"place to be avoided\". On 17 December 2017, Aleksandar Savković, member of the FK Rad\\'s supporter group, was killed in front of the club and another person was wounded. Lukas. Though opened in 1985, its fame rests in the 1990s. It was located on the left bank of the Savar, in Ušće. By the mid-1990s it became extremely popular and became gathering place for the members of two criminal clans, Voždovac and Zvezdara. On 27 November 1994 there was a major shootout, which included the river police. Several clan members were wounded, while Bojan Banović, member of the Voždovac clan was killed. Shootings continued in the times to come. As of 2017, a splav with a different name is on the location. One of the first to play turbo-folk music, the \"Lukas\" has been described as the \"monument to the 1990s\". Sunset. The club was located in the Hotel Metropol, at 69 Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. Miroslav Kurak, a participant in the assassination of a journalist Slavko Ćuruvija in 1999, was a co-owner. The club was known for its mixed clientele: businessmen, members of the diplomatic corps but also numerous gangsters, including Rade  Ćaldović Ćenta and Milorad Ulemek Legija, later convicted of the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić. Employees of the club used the last floor in the hotel. In 2002, police raided the premises and discovered huge amount of guns. Several days later, a fire broke out on this floor, officially due to the bad wiring. Industrija. The most popular techno rave club. It was located at 19 Vasina Street and played only electronic music. Described as a place with \"numerous fairytales, myths and truths\" told about it. The venue later hosted the \"Ilegala\" café, while today it is a bakery. \"Industrija\" is described as \"writing the history of the Serbian electronic scene\" and the \"place where everything started\".

Due to the volatile history in the Balkans, various kafanas served as gathering places and recruitment centers for numerous wars and rebellions: \"Crni Konj\" (Zadarska Street? for individual fighters in the Serbian-Ottoman Wars), \"Kragujevac\" (Kara?or?eva Street Garibalidians, Italian volunteers in the Serbian-Turkish Wars of 1876–1878, \"Zlatni Krst\" (Serbian volunteers for the same conflict), etc.\\', \\'They were socially important as they allowed for the poor classes toparticipate in economic activities, too.

Kafanas hosted numerous firsts in Belgrade: bank (First Serbian Bank, in \"Staro Zdanje\", went bankrupt in 1875), exchange office, labor market, stock exchange (in \"Bosna\", corner of Kara?or?eva and Travni?ka, in 1895), insurance office, private medical office, photographic studio.

      "{'input': ' Africa. Uganda. Under President Idi Amin, many Ugandan people were killed, including minority groups. Many others were tortured. South Africa. Incidents of police brutality skyrocketed by 312% from 2011 to 2012 compared to 2001 to 2002, with only 1 in 100 cases leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action from 2011 to 2012.In 2015, as a result of police officers being accused of crimes such as rape, torture, and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget. The police commissioner at the time, Riah Phiyega, blamed the large number of claims \"on a highly litigious climate\".Police brutality has spread throughout Soweto. Nathaniel Julius was killed in Soweto by police officers from the El Dorado police station. He was a 16 year old boy with Down Syndrome, and was shot because he didn\\'t respond to the police officer calling him. This action was not warranted because Nathaniel didn\\'t have any weapons on him and he was just walking from the store after buying biscuits. Two police officers were arrested over Julius\\' death on murder charges, after mass protests against this in the area. South African police are commonly accused of excessive force, with ten deaths attributed to police the same year (2020). Ethiopia. Egypt. Police brutality was a major contribution to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Khaled Said\\'s death, though little has changed since. One of the \"demands\" around which people decided to take to the streets in Egypt was \"purging the Ministry of Interior\" for its brutality and torture practices. After six months of reporting gang rape, a woman in Egypt is still seeking justice not only for herself, but also those who were witnesses in her favor and are jailed, tortured in pretrial custody. The lack of investigation into the Fairmont Hotel rape case of 2014 has also put the Egyptian authorities under condemnation. Reportedly, the prime witnesses of the case have been subjected to drug testing, virginity tests and publicly defamed, while their families suffer trauma. Asia. Bangladesh. On February 21, 1952, in Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, students from the University of Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College organized a demonstration to protest the decision to establish Urdu as the only state language. Despite the enforcement of Section 144, which banned public gatherings, the students assembled peacefully. However, police were ordered to disperse the crowd. This led to the use of tear gas and eventually live ammunition against the unarmed students. Several students, including Abdul Jabbar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat, and Abdus Salam, were killed in the crackdown.In May 2017, a man named Shamim Reja was killed by police in the Sonargaon police station. The victim\\'s father claimed that his son was tortured in the police station as the police wanted Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 600,000. Police investigated and the officer-in-charge Arup Torofar, SI Paltu Ghush, and ASP Uttam Prashad were found guilty as charged.In Shahbag, Bangladesh on 26 January 2017, hundreds of protesters against the Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company were taken into custody with extreme force by police officers. The protesters were struck by police officers and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them. China. Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Associations such as Falun Gong have objected against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and which are dispersed by riot police. Chinese protesters have been able to systematize powerful group mobilizations with the use of social media and informal mass communication like Twitter and its Chinese counterparts Weibo.In Xintang, Canton Province (Guangzhou), protests over allegations of corruption and abuse of power abound in the country – they are the principal cause of discontent in the CCP the then-CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Xintang region, Canton Province (Guangzhou), is an influential textile hub, attracting thousands of workers from all over the country, and what lit the fuse was a complaint of mistreatment against a pregnant migrant worker. Protests on 20 February used a website to urge participants not to shout more anti-government slogans, but to go outside for a quiet walk in the places where they had been deciding to continue the protest. After a brutal police response, the authorities installed corrugated metal fences outside the restaurant and the home of dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes security officers and volunteers with red armbands, pre-emptively positioned in Wangfujing. This presence interrupted the orderly operation of the shops. Hong Kong SAR. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, there were numerous instances of police brutality. Seven police officers were caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed. There had also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. Pictures on local TV and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers\\' views were blocked, and in some cases, re-emerging with visible injuries. An officer-involved, retired police officer Frankly Chu King-wai was sentenced to three months in prison for causing serious bodily harm.During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests which gained extensive international coverage, complaints of police brutality increased substantially and broke previous records of complaints.Cases that have caused outrage include the police\\'s mauling and intentional head-shooting of protesters by rubber bullets and rapid tear-gassing of a surrounded crowd. Numerous were critically wounded. Many Hong Kong citizens accuse the police of attempting to murder protesters to deter the people from exercising their freedom of expression.. Amnesty International released a report on 21 June 2019 denouncing the role of the Hong Kong police in the 12 June protest that ended up in bloodshed.Several street conflicts continued in Hong Kong throughout July 2019. Instances of police striking journalists with batons to obstruct their live reporting have been filmed.On the night of 31 August 2019, more than 200 riot police officers entered the Prince Edward MTR station and attacked suspects in a train compartment on the Tsuen Wan line with batons and pepper spray. Many suspects sustained head injuries. Until November 2019, several alleged cases of sexual violence, \"disappearings\", and falling deaths were found to have been directly involved with Hong Kong police brutality, and massive attacks on campus and streets have been also occurring with the concurrent deterioration of the city. Iran. In 1979, authorities stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held many of the workers hostage.. The 2009 Iranian Presidential election protests over the victory of Mahmoud Ahmeninejad, the police and paramilitary forces used excessive force against protestors, injuring and killing many. Many detentions, injuries and deaths of protestors, including children, were also reported on the 2019-2020 protests.In April 2018, a video showed a female member of Iran\\'s morality police slapping a woman and wrestling her to the ground, for allegedly not complying with Iran\\'s mandatory headscarf. The police\\'s actions were widely condemned, including by Iran\\'s vice-president for women\\'s affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar. Iran\\'s interior ministry ordered an inquiry.On September 13, 2022, Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman was detained by authorities. She was announced dead on September 16, 2022, allegedly due to cardiac arrest. However, it was likely due to injuries acquired due to the brutality she encountered. This incident sparked massive protests, and women burning the mandatory headscarf. The head of Tehran\\'s morality police was later suspended. Iraq. Saddam Hussein used to use the police to arrest any one who opposed him. Israel. India. During India\\'s independence struggle, protestors and activists were subject to Lathi charges and shootings. One such incident is recalled as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, where a crowd gathered to protest the Rowlatt act were indiscriminately fired at, on the orders of a British Officer, General Dyer with 200 casualties.During the emergency of 1975-1977, several cases of Police Brutality were recorded, including the Rajan case on 31 March 1976.. On 23 January 2017, a pro-jallikattu silent protest in Tamil Nadu turned violent. The National Human Rights Commission consolidated reports that the police used violent methods without prior warning, including beatings and damaging private property, to disperse protesters in Chennai. There were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire. On 15 December 2019 police authorities baton-charged students who were protesting against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act at University Library of Jamia Milia University, New Delhi. The Lathi Charge is very well known in India for excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riots. Indonesia. Islamic extremists in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. In many cases, they are either captured or killed. There are cases of police corruption involving hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists investigating these claims; one example occurred in June 2012 when Indonesian magazine Tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on 31 August 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody; five people were killed and 34 injured. The police\\'s history of violence goes back to the military-backed Suharto regime (1967–1998) when Suharto seized power during an alleged coup and instituted an anti-Communist purge.Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments are light, and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. Amnesty International has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing to ensure that they meet international standards. Malaysia. During the Bersih protests, Malaysian police attacked protesters and killed one. Malaysian police also cane prisoners for several offences, including theft, drug dealing and molestation. Philippines. The discussions of police brutality in the Philippines were revived on 21 December 2020 when a civilian police officer Jonel Nuezca shot his two unarmed neighbors following an argument over an improvised noise maker known locally as boga set up by the victim a day earlier. The incident sparked nationwide outrage and most news organizations linked the incident to the war on drugs. Prior to the incident, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte had made remarks on ordering the police to shoot-to-kill but Duterte \"denied\" it to \"shoot\" on civilians. Singapore. In Singapore, people cannot protest. Police have also caned people for vandalism and other offences. United Arab Emirates. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states have seen many cases of brutality, with some even involving senior figures. For example, Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a United Arab Emirates (UAE) sheikh, was involved in the torture of many business associates. He often recorded some of the abuse. Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him. Amnesty International reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation. UAE prisoners are also treated poorly and tortured. Saudi Arabia. Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.Jamal Khashoggi was a Saudi-American activist and his death inside a Saudi Embassy drew widespread criticism. In October 2018, he went into the Embassy in Turkey. On that same day, a group of Saudi authorities entered the country and intercepted him at the Embassy and killed him soon after. They disposed of his body and then returned to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain. In Bahrain, police and military personnel manhandled and shot dead many Arab Spring protesters. Pakistan. Pakistan\\'s law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers, including forces under provincial and federal government control. The law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals; however, due to deficiencies during the training process, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes.. A recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named \"Rao Anwar\". Taking notice of the matter, the Supreme Court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.In October 2019, the People National Alliance organised a rally to free Kashmir from Pakistani rule. As a result of the police trying to stop the rally, 100 people were injured. Thailand. In 1976, Thai police, military personnel and others, were seen shooting at protesters at Thammasat University. Many were killed and many survivors were abused. Turkey. Turkey has a history of police brutality, including the use of torture particularly between 1977 and 2002. Police brutality featured excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters), pepper spray, and water cannons. Physical violence against protesters has been observed, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and May Day demonstrations. The 2013 protests in Turkey were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of Taksim Gezi Park.. In 2012 several officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of the political activist Engin Çeber.. The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.In 2021, the General Directorate of Security issued a circular banning all audio-visual recordings of law enforcement officers at protests. Turkmenistan. Europe. Austria. In Vienna, there is an association made between Vienna\\'s drug problem and the city\\'s African migrants, which have led to African migrants being racially profiled.There have been several highly publicized incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people—in some cases, to the point of death. While the most notorious of these incidents occurred in the late 1990s, incidents as recent as 2019 are being investigated by the Vienna Police Department for Special Investigations.. 24 April 1996: Nicola Jevremović, a Serbian Romani man, tried to pay a friend\\'s parking fine and was harassed by police. He escaped and a group of 25 to 40 police officers entered his home without a warrant. The police officers violently beat him and his wife, Violetta Jevremović, in front of their children and then arrested the couple. The couple were made to wait outside for half an hour in front of their neighbours, allegedly to humiliate them. Nicola Jevremović was initially fined for a misdemeanor and found guilty in 1997 of \"resisting arrest\". Violetta Jevremović was found guilty of \"suspicion of resisting arrest\".. November 1998: Dr. C, a black Austrian citizen, was stopped by police after reversing his car into a one-way street and asked, \"Why are you driving the wrong way, nigger?\". He was beaten unconscious and handcuffed. Police continued beating him after he regained consciousness. After he was arrested, he spent 11 days recovering in the hospital.. May 1999: Marcus Omofuma, a Nigerian asylum-seeker, was being deported from Vienna when the officers taped him to his chair \"like a mummy\" and stuck tape over his mouth. He suffocated whilst in police custody.. 1 January 2015: A 47-year-old woman was beaten and taken into custody after refusing to take a breathalyzer test while walking home on New Year\\'s Eve. She suffered a fractured coccyx, and severe bruising to her head and knees. She filed a complaint and received no response. The case was re-examined by the prosecutor only after she found CCTV footage.. 28 July 2015: A 27-year-old man, suspected of being a pickpocket, was handcuffed and violently thrown to the ground while in police custody. Police said that the man had been injured while \"pressing his head against the wall\". Video evidence showed him being passive and compliant before the altercation.There has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians\\' rights in Austria, with Amnesty International reporting that in 1998–1999 very few people who violated human rights were brought to justice. This was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation, and assault.From 2014 to 2015, 250 accusations of police misconduct were made against officers in Vienna with none being charged, though 1,329 people were charged with \"civil disorder\" in a similar time period. The Council of Europe\\'s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)\\'s 2014 report included several complaints of police using excessive force with detainees and psychiatric patients. The culture of excusing police officers for their misconduct has continued into the present day, and any complaints of mistreatment are often met with inadequate investigations and judicial proceedings.Austria has legislation that criminalizes hate speech against anyone\\'s race, religion, nationality, or ethnicity. Laws like this discourage discrimination, help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups, and subsequently reduce the number of racially motivated incidents of police brutality. Austria has several NGOs that are trying to implement broad programs that encourage positive cross-cultural relations and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. The Austrian police are formulating their policies to prevent police brutality and to make prosecuting police misconduct fairer. In January 2016, Austrian police forces started a trial of wearing body cameras to document civilian—police interactions.However, it appears that incidents of police brutality are still occurring. Amnesty International suggested that more work needs to be done by the government to reduce negative stereotypes that lead to prejudice, racial profiling, hatred, and police brutality. One suggestion was to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna\\'s riot police, as they have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty International also proposed that the Austrian government adopt a National Action Plan against Racism, something which they had previously refused to do. Such a plan was required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Belarus. In May 2021, authorities stopped Ryanair Flight 4978 in Belarusian airspace. A Belarusian journalist and activist, Roman Protasevich was taken off the plane and detained by authorities. Belgium. Belgian law enforcement changed to two police forces operating on a federal and local level in 2001 after a three-tier police system. While the two services remain independent, they integrate common training programs and recruitment. The change was prompted by a national parliamentary report into a series of pedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.The United Nations (UN) Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are replicated in Belgian law through The Criminal Code and the Police Functions Act. These principles dictate that the use of force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported, and delivered on time; however, the UN Human Rights Committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against property and people by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger. Belgian judicial authorities were found to also have failed to notify national police watchdog, Committee P, of criminal convictions against police, which is both a direct breach of Belgian judicial procedure and a failure to comply with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.An extreme instance in January 2010 led to the death of Jonathan Jacob in Mortsel. He was apprehended by local Mortsel police for behaving strangely under the influence of amphetamines. The footage depicted eight officers from Antwerp police\\'s Special Intervention Unit restraining and beating Jacob after he had been injected with a sedative sparked public outrage. Jacob died from internal bleeding following the incident, but police claimed they did not make any mistakes and \"acted carefully, respecting the necessary precautions\".In 2013, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) convicted Belgium of human rights violations in an appeal on the treatment of two brothers in custody who had been slapped by an officer. The Grand Chamber voiced its concern that \"a slap inflicted by a law-enforcement officer on an individual who is entirely under his control constitutes a serious attack on the individual\\'s dignity\". The Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH) monitored police brutality through the Observatory of Police Violence (OBSPOL) after Belgium downplayed cases. OBSPOL was formed in 2013 and collects testimonies on its website, informs police brutality victims of their rights, and strongly advocating public policy being adapted in of favor victim protection.Several other instances of police violence can be noted in Belgium. In 2014, Mawda, a four-year-old child was killed in an encounter with a truck used to carry migrants across the border. A police officer shot on the moving car, despite knowing a child was in it. The case got widespread media attention, but the police officer only ended up with a 400€ fine and one year of suspended prison sentence.In 2018, Lamine Bangoura was killed in his own apartment by eight policemen because he had not paid rent. In the attempt to evict him out of his flat, the policemen used unwarranted brutality which resulted in Lamine\\'s death.In 2019, Mehdi, 17-year-old Moroccan boy was run over by a police car on patrol. In 2020, Adil, a 19-year-old Moroccan boy was chased by a police car for not respecting the Coronavirus curfew. He was hit by a police car to stop him in his chase, which killed him on impact. Sources say it was on purpose, even though he was on a scooter. Both these cases had been filed as dismissed.In 2021, Ibrahima was arrested. He was filming a police control. The authorities however, said he was arrested for not respecting the curfew, which starts at 10pm, even though his arrest happened at 6pm. He died in police custody, in unknown circumstances. His death prompted a lot of reaction from the public, who organized a protest a few days after his killing. Croatia. The Constitution of Croatia prohibits torture, mistreatment, and cruel and degrading punishment under Article 17, and accords arrested and convicted persons humane treatment under Article 25 of the OHCHR. Croatia has a centralised police force under the command of the Ministry of the Interior with approximately 20,000 police officers.From 1991 to 1995, the Croatian police, in addition to their regular police tasks, were a militarised force charged with the role of defending the country while seceding from Yugoslavia. Military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting other procedures, which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force. Developments were made to achieve democratic policing as a modern, professional force that is also accountable to the public. However, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarization of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by Croatian police officers.The European Court of Human Rights has found that Croatian police authorities have failed to fulfill their obligations, on numerous occasions, under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by failing to carry out effective investigations to protect its citizens and tourists from violent attacks. In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Croatian police authorities for ignoring requests to starting an investigation into perpetrators who violently attacked a Croatian citizen.The Croatian police have a history of discriminatory abuse and failing to recognise violence against the Romani minority living in Croatia. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance noted that Croatian police abuse against minority groups including Romani were continually reported; police authorities are reluctant to take violence against Romani people seriously. Police investigations into black market selling in Croatia have been excessively violent towards Romani vendors, with reports of physical violence and abusive racism being directed at them. The Romani women\\'s association, \"Better Future\", reported that police had beaten a pregnant Romani woman who attempted to evade arrest for black market selling in 2002.The Croatian police violence has been used to intimidate refugees travelling from Serbia into Croatia. This included segregating nationalities, with Syrian, Iraqi, and Afghani nationals gaining entry to Croatia as refugees more easily than other nationalities. An unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from Morocco recounted his experience trying to gain asylum in Croatia after lying about being a Syrian national: \"We had to get into a police car [...] They told us this is Slovenia, but then it was Serbia [...] One of my friends tried to run away, but the Croatian police caught [sic] him and beat him.\" Denmark. The Police of Denmark has a force of approximately 11,000 officers and they serve in the 12 police districts and the two Danish overseas territories. The Danish Independent Police Complaints Authority (Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed) (the Authority) handles the investigation of police misconduct allegations. Annual statistics released by the Authority revealed a reduction in the number of complaints against police from 2012 to 2015. In 2012, the Authority received 726 conduct complaints from across Denmark; in 2015, the number of complaints fell to 509, representing approximately 0.05 complaints per officer. A majority of complaints stem from general misconduct, such as traffic violations and unprofessional behaviour (e.g., swearing).However, the 2015 Annual Report identifies some instances where the Police of Denmark used excessive force. For example, the Authority investigated a complaint made about alleged violence against an arrested person in Christianshavn on 15 March 2016. Another investigation looked into the alleged use of force against a 16-year-old boy on 28 June 2016, which resulted in charges being laid against the two offending police officers from the Sydsjællands- and Lolland-Falster police department. Although examples of police brutality are not common, highly publicised incidents have been reported. In 2002, 21-year-old Jens Arne Orskov Mathiason died while in police custody on the way to prison. The incident raised concerns over the behaviour of the officers involved, the thoroughness of the subsequent investigation, and the willingness of the Director of Public Prosecutions to hold the officers accountable for their alleged failings. As a result, Amnesty International called for the establishment of new policies to investigate human rights violations and enforce compliance under the European Convention on Human Rights.. In January 2016, a man died in police custody after being arrested by seven Copenhagen Police officers.. In August 2009, police in Copenhagen were heavily criticised for their response to an attempt to remove Iraqi refugees who were living in a city church. Video allegedly showed the police using violence against the refugees and their supporters. Between 12,000 and 20,000 people subsequently protested against these actions.. In 2012, the Danish Court of Appeal concluded that the Danish Police had violated Article 3 (against abusive treatment and torture) and Articles 5, 10, and 11 (dealing with the right to liberty, the right to information about the accusation, and the freedom of peaceful assembly) of the European Convention of Human Rights for the 2009 mass arrest made during protests at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.To ensure that police are well-trained and to mitigate the risk of police brutality, police recruits undergo approximately three years of training; at the National Police College, recruits learn about police theory, the Road Traffic Act, criminal law, physical training, other legislation, first aid, radio communication, securing evidence, identifying drugs, preventing crime, management, human rights, and cultural sociology to name a few. After this training period, recruits are promoted to the position of a police constable. By comparison, US police academies provide an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction. The prolonged training in Denmark was observed to increase the ability of police to effectively de-escalate conflicts and enact their duties professionally and responsibly.. To keep police officers accountable and to ensure that they perform their duties in compliance with Danish, European and international laws, the Independent Police Complaints Authority has the power to handle criminal investigations against police officers and determine complaints of police misconduct. This body is independent of both the police and prosecutors. For example, police \"[...] may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. Any assessment of the justification of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties.\". Therefore, police in Denmark are held to high standards and will face consequences if they breach their obligations to encourage compliance. Victims of police misconduct are encouraged to lodge a report with the Authority. Estonia. The Estonian Police force was temporarily dissolved in 1940 when Estonia lost its independence to the Soviet Union after it was occupied, before the Police Act passed in 1990 dissolved the Soviet militsiya and re-established it. In 2010, the Public Order Police, Police Board, Central Criminal Police, Border Guard, Citizenship, and Migration Board merged into the Police and Border Guard Board. It is the largest state agency in Estonia with over 5000 people in employment. The main objectives for this organisation are to maintain security and public order, crime prevention, detection and investigation, securing the European Union (EU) border, citizenship and identity documentation administration.. The Estonian Ministry of Justice reports that crime figures dropped by 10% from 2013 to 2015. They instruct that those who find themselves detained by the police should comply with their instructions and those who experience a language barrier are allowed to \"request the presence of an interpreter and should not sign any documents or reports until they are confident that the document\\'s contents are consistent with the details of the incident or the victim\\'s statement\".Incidents of police abuse are very rare. Although uncommon, powers are sometimes abused which leads to police brutality, such as the 2007 Bronze Soldier riots. Bronze Night. The Bronze Night occurred from 26 to 29 April 2007, when riots broke out over the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn being relocated. The government wanted to relocate the statue and rebury the associated remains near the Tallinn Military Cemetery; the response was heavily negative among the country\\'s Russophone population, but for Estonians historically the Bronze Soldier served as a symbol of Soviet occupation and repression. For Russian citizens, it represented Soviet Russia\\'s victory over Germany in World War II and their claim to equal rights in Estonia.. One Russian rioter was killed and other protesters were arrested. Due to the overcrowded detention centres, many of the detainees were taken to cargo terminals in Tallinn\\'s seaport. Then-chairman of the Constitution Party Andrei Zarenkov stated \"people were forced to squat for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastic handcuffs which caused great pain. The police selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers. We have pictures of a toilet which is stained with the blood of the injured\".The police department denied all claims made against them. On 22 May 2007, the Office of Prosecutor General of Estonia received more than fifty complaints on the police brutality that occurred during Bronze Night and opened seven criminal cases against them. In November 2007, the United Nations Committee against torture expressed concerns over the use of excessive force and brutality by law enforcement personnel in regards to Bronze Night. The Council of Europe published in its report that those detained were not granted all the fundamental safeguards, including the right to a doctor or a lawyer, and to inform a relative or a third party of their arrest. It was later discovered that the accused were only allowed outside contact and lawyer assistance when brought before a judge. Several detainees were denied access to a doctor while in police custody despite displaying visible injuries. France. The policing structure of the nineteenth century France has been linked to the outcomes of France\\'s reorganisation during the French Revolution. There have been multiple instances of violent enforcement stemming from issues around racial and geographic differences throughout France\\'s history. Additionally, the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International reported human rights violations by France including physical and psychological abuse as a result of excessive force towards Muslims when undertaking house raids.France\\'s police ombudsman is currently dealing with 48 judicial inquiries into police brutality against its citizens, in which 1,000 individuals have been arrested within three months. There have been several high-profile cases of alleged police brutality which have gained media attention, including the death of Lamine Dieng on 17 June 2007, who died after suffocating in a police van while he was constrained. The investigation of Lamine\\'s death is ongoing. Grey areas around police accountability have come to light, including questions over how his body was covered in bruises and whether or not carotid restraint (which involves constricting the carotid arteries) was used against him. The European Court of Human Rights condemned France in 1998 for their apparent use of carotid constriction. This same method of restraint was seen to be used against Hakim Ajimi who died of positional asphyxia as a result of overwhelming pressure being placed on his chest and neck by police.. Recent protests over disputed labor laws have revealed the extreme nature of police brutality in France, as many videos have surfaced in the media depicting police using disproportionate force on protesters. French officials have forced these aggressive videos to be destroyed.A group known as the Stolen Lives Collective formed in response to the increased number of cases of police brutality in French communities. It represents families of those who have been affected by police brutality. The group strongly demands the government to act against police brutality and to reduce racism present across the police force in France.On 14 December 2018, Amnesty International reported police brutality during the yellow vests movement. France\\'s yellow vests protests began against an increased fuel tax made by President Emmanuel Macron. Participation in the weekly protests diminished due to violence, particularly due to the loss of eyes and hands, and the development of neurological disorders caused by police blast balls. The protests eventually stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic but continued again after health restrictions lifted.In June 2023, widespread protests began after the killing of Nahel Merzouk. Finland. Historically, police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s following the Finnish Civil War. Some local sections of the secret police (Etsivä Keskuspoliisi) routinely beat up arrested communists.In 2006, there were 7,700 police officers in Finland. That police force was seen to be more law-abiding than firemen; however, a few dozen cases each year involved police officers being convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of similar crimes prosecuted annually. The number of these crimes were shown to increase annually. Police officers are most often suspected of traffic-related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions, etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration. The second-highest category (approximately 20%) involving police is the use of excessive force which, except for of some off-duty petty assaults (which includes a slap on the cheek), proceed to the prosecutor without fail.In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable lured a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki, inflicting bruises all over Pourak\\'s body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. Facial bones were also broken and he was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence. In 2010, two police officers assaulted a man in a wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man\\'s hands and pushed him backward and broke a femur in the process. In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day-fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stomping on a Romani man\\'s head onto the asphalt three times. According to the police, he had resisted, contrary to eyewitness accounts. A third officer testified that the event was captured on surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed. The officer also stated that they had seen the footage and claimed that the video did not show any resistance on the part of the victim, but also that the assault happened out of the camera\\'s view. Germany. Germany is sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, though this has not stopped international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment of foreigners and members of ethnic minorities. Every year, around 2,000 complaints of police brutality are reported, though it is highly suspected that the actual number of cases is under-reported. As high-profile cases like the 2014 Cologne New Year\\'s Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances of police brutality. High profile cases of police brutality have been reported to occur as far back as the 1960s: 2 June 1967: Benno Ohnesorg was shot and killed by a policeman during a demonstration against the state visit of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.. 28 May 1999: Sudanese national Aamir Ageeb died of asphyxia during his forced deportation from Frankfurt. Before departure, Ageeb was forcibly restrained by tape and rope. During take-off, police officers allegedly forced his head and upper body between his knees.. 8 December 2000: Josef Hoss was accused by his neighbour (a police officer) of harbouring firearms; he was ambushed, beaten, and handcuffed near his home. He woke up in the police station with a cloth bag over his head and sustained multiple injuries that prevented him from working or being able to financially support his family. No firearms were found during the investigation.. May 2002: Stephan Neisius was repeatedly kicked and hit by a group of police officers while he was handcuffed on the floor of a police station. He spent 13 days in hospital on life support before dying. Although the Cologne District Court convicted all six police officers of bodily harm resulting in death, none of the accused served prison sentences.. 2012: Teresa Z. called the police after a fight with her boyfriend got out of hand but was quickly arrested. She was punched by police officer Frank W. and received a broken nose and eye socket while in detention. Frank W. spent ten months in jail and was forced to pay a fine of 3,000 euros.As law enforcement is vested solely with the states of Germany, each state\\'s police force (or \"Land\" police) follows a different system of law. Accordingly, there is an absence of a federal comprehensive register, compiling and publishing regular, uniform, and comprehensive figures on complaints about police ill-treatment. Even though Germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, Amnesty International (2002) highlights the authorities failed to protect a range of human rights as guaranteed by international human rights law and standards.. A study conducted in 2019 on police brutality in Germany found that it led to complaints in only 9%, and trials in only 13% of the cases. The study was conducted by the Ruhr-University of Bochum and was the biggest study at the time to be conducted on police brutality in Germany. The study found that the low number of complaints was likely due to a low expectation of success. Furthermore, most German states do not require their police force to carry identification, making it difficult for victims to lodge complaints against individuals.. Watchdog organizations have also criticized the lack of independent institutions for investigations into police violence.Despite this objective lack of accountability for policing practice, public levels of trust in police remain among the highest in the EU only behind Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. This allows Germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the EU, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, compared to the EU average of 1.8 percent. As a result, Germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. Lower numbers exist in Scandinavian countries and the UK, suggesting that Germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing, despite instances of police brutality. German police officers rarely use their guns; as of August 2017, 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998 were reported, and only 8 fatalities in the two years before the report. Greece. The Greek Police, known officially as the Hellenic Police, assumed their current structure in 1984 as a result of merging the Gendarmerie (Chorofylaki) and the Urban Police Forces (Astynomia Poleon). Composed of central and regional departments, the Hellenic Police have a relatively long history of police brutality. One of the first documented incidents dates back to 1976, where 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. In 1980, during a demonstration commemorating the Athens Polytechnic uprising, 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou and 24-year-old Iakovos Koumis were beaten to death by the Greek police. The protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. The protests are still commonly affected by police brutality around the time of the event. On 17 November 1985 another protestor, 15-year-old Michalis Kaltezas, was murdered by the police during the demonstration commemorating the Polytechnic uprising.The level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years have been profound. Due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. Greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.In 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. It was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the police\\'s press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection—Nikos Dendias—supported the police and claimed that they needed to use Photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable. In October 2012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party (and later deemed a criminal organization) \"Golden Dawn\". Victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the Attica General Police Directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. Dendias countered by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on The Guardian report the next day were fired.Police brutality in Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill-treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which took place on 17 November 2014. Allegations against police have emerged specifically concerning their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range – in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in the hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they laughed.Video footage confirmed that on 13 November 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings. Amnesty International called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of \"abuse and impunity\" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.A German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. The student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.. May 2011: student Yannis Kafkas suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.. June 2011: Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade at him and caused him to suffer from permanent hearing loss.. February 2012: photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery done after being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was allegedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.There have been instances where protesters were used as human shields – a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.None of the cases of police brutality above resulted in any prosecution of police force members. One case that sparked nationwide riots was the death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens, sparkling large riots against police brutality. Unlike other cases, the police officer responsible was convicted of murder. Hungary. In 2008 when Hungary\\'s two law enforcement bodies, the police (Rendőrség) and the Border Guards merged when the nation signed the Schengen Agreement; Border Guards became police officers. The police force in Hungary consists of the National Bureau of Investigation and the Operational Police, who respectively deal with investigating severe crimes and riot suppression. A third police group, Terrorelhárítási Központ, which deals mainly with counter-terrorism nationwide, also exists. 44,923 employees make up the Rendőrség force in Hungary. Brutality and corruption exist within Rendőrség.The 1998 Human Rights Watch World Report revealed that the Roma minority in Hungary were continually discriminated against. It was evident in the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality.. The 2006 protests in response to Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány\\'s speech where he said that the Socialist Party lied their way into office demonstrated the disproportionate measures police took particularly police brutality on non-violent civilians. Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Protesters and non-violent civilians passing by were targeted, tackled, and injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man and raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters, and paramedics.. Hungarian Spectrum blogger Eva S. Bologh suggest that rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rendőrség, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to the proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force. The requirements to become a police officer in Hungary are to graduate from high school, pass a matriculation exam, and complete two years in the police academy. Compared to other countries around the world, the two-year program is shorter than Denmark\\'s (3-year program), and longer than Australia\\'s (33-week program) and the United States\\' (18 weeks). The current two-year program is quite lengthy, however, time is not the issue. Most of what the Hungarian police academy teaches is academic theory and not much on practice. If practical work was given more attention in the Hungarian police academy, the number of police brutality incidents will likely decrease. Ireland. Northern Ireland (UK). Police brutality has been a long-standing issue in Northern Ireland due to unsavoury police procedures used during the Troubles to obtain admissions of guilt. The Troubles in Northern Ireland lasted from 1968 until 2007 and were essentially a civil war between those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom (unionists/loyalists, predominantly Protestants) and those who did not (Irish nationalists/republicans, predominantly Catholics). During this time as many as 50,000 people were physically maimed or injured, some by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI, previously called Royal Ulster Constabulary). Instances of Northern Irish Police brutality were confirmed by the 1978 report from the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded that five interrogation techniques used by the police, which included wall standing, deprivation of food, drink or sleep, subjection to noise, and forcing detainees to remain in the same position for hours, were instances of cruel and degrading treatment. Such brutality was not recognized by domestic courts until 2010, where 113 people, some of them minors, came forward to have their complaints heard.. At present Northern Ireland still faces policing issues, though not to the extent during the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police against children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which have led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police. Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion. The PSNI has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease in the use of the baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used); however, harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland. Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland\\'s police force is called the Garda Síochána (Garda) and employs around 14,500 staff. Ireland\\'s criminal laws allow \"reasonable force\" to be used by the police with regard to all the circumstances, which eludes to officers actions being proportionate in the circumstances. Excessive use of force is unlawful, though section 76(7) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows the following considerations when deciding on what force is reasonable.. A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh up the exact necessary action at the time or may act instinctively but honestly – in these instances, the use of force may be considered reasonable.This is acknowledged by the Garda, who state: \"Unfortunately, even in the most civilised democratic jurisdictions, tragedies resulting from police use of force will continue to devastate families and communities\".The use of force by Irish Police officers has been of international concern, when the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported on this issue in the Republic three times within a decade. Incidents that prompted this concern centred around the death of John Carty, a man suffering from mental illness who was shot and killed by police; the prosecution of seven Garda police members due to assaults on protesters in 2002 and in 2005; and a fifteen-year-old boy who died after spending time in Garda custody. Given this state of events, the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections. Italy. The use of excessive violence by police officers has been a major concern in Italy since the 2000s. Beatings and violence are commonly used during demonstrations, and several murders have been carried out.. The following incidents caused concern in the country: On 11 July 2001, 23-year-old student Carlo Giuliani was killed by police officers when they opened fire on a group of protesters during the anti-globalization demonstration outside the July 2001 G8 summit. 25-year-old police officer Mario Placanica was considered to be responsible for Giuliani\\'s death but was not charged. Placanica asserted that he was being used as a scapegoat to cover up for the responsible parties and that other officers caused Giuliani\\'s death, shooting at Giuliani from a nearby location. Nobody was arrested for Giuliani\\'s murder.. On 11 July 2003, Marcello Lonzi, aged 29, was beaten and tortured to death in his cell. Lonzi was arrested in the city of Livorno four months prior, as he was suspected of carrying out an attempted theft. Although his death was considered to be caused by \"a heart attack after a fall\", signs of torture were found on his body. Nobody was arrested for Lonzi\\'s death.. On 25 September 2005 in Ferrara, at around 5 a.m., a woman called police claiming that she saw \"a strange man walking around\". The man, 18-year-old Federico Aldrovandi, who had spent the night in Bologna before returning to Ferrara, was stopped by four policemen. The four officers then began to beat and torture Aldrovandi, killing him at the scene. The officers were arrested and sentenced to three years and six months in prison.. On 27 October 2007 in Trieste, 34-year-old schizophrenic Riccardo Rasman was launching firecrackers to celebrate his recent employment as a waste collector. Police were called by a resident as he heard suspected shots (which were the firecrackers\\' noise). Four police officers stormed the house, beating Rasman. The man was hit with iron objects and gagged. The officer pressed their knee on his neck and back, causing Rasman to die of asphyxia. The four officers were sentenced to just six months of prison.. On 14 October 2007 in Pietralunga, 44-year-old carpenter Aldo Bianzino and his wife, Roberta Radici, were arrested for a handful of marijuana plants at their home. Bianzino stated that the plants were for personal use. When the couple arrived at a police station, they were separated. Two days later, an officer approached Radici in her cell and asked her if her husband has heart problems. Radici responded that Aldo never had health issues and was in good condition, and demanded to know why the officer had asked her the question. The officer responded that Aldo Bianzino had been brought to the hospital in serious condition. Three hours later, Radici was freed from her cell and inquired as to when she could see Aldo. The officer callously responded: \"after the autopsy.\" During Bianzino\\'s autopsy, several signs of violence emerged, including broken ribs, damage to the liver and spleen, and several bruises. A policeman was sentenced in 2015 to a year in prison for lack of assistance. Roberta Radici died of cancer in 2008.. On 11 November 2007 near Arezzo, a group of five friends, including 27-year-old Gabriele Sandri, were in a car headed to a football match between Inter and S.S. Lazio. The five men, supporters of S.S. Lazio, were stopped by a car of Juventus supporters, and a fight erupted. Policeman Luigi Spaccarotella intervened and opened fire, killing Gabriele Sandri with a single gunshot wound to his neck. The policeman was sentenced to nine years and five months in prison. However, he was freed in 2017 with semi-liberty.. On 14 June 2008 in Varese, Giuseppe Uva was stopped along with his friend Alberto Bigigoggero by two police officers, who demanded to see the two men\\'s documents. Uva refused, angrily kicking at the door of a nearby house. Other police officers arrived at the scene and arrested Uva and Bigigoggero. Uva died the next morning. Signs of violence were on Uva\\'s body, and Bigigoggero confirmed that Uva had been tortured. Attorney general Massimo Gaballo asked for ten years of imprisonment for each of the eight officers involved in Uva\\'s death. However, none of the officers were charged. Uva\\'s sister insisted that her brother was murdered, receiving support from Luigi Manconi, who promised to fight for the truth.. On 15 October 2009 in Rome, 31-year-old Stefano Cucchi was stopped by five policemen after they had seen him selling transparent packaging to a man in exchange for money. Cucchi was arrested and brought to a police station, where officers found cocaine and hashish in his pocket, along with medicine for epilepsy, as Cucchi was affected by the disease. Cucchi was described by officers as \"a homeless foreigner\", but he was an Italian who resided regularly at a home in Rome. Cucchi was beaten before his trial, which led him to walk with fatigue and with evident punch-inflicted injuries to his eyes. A week later, his condition worsened, as he continued to be tortured in custody, resulting in several fractures and a stay in the hospital. Cucchi died at the hospital on 22 October. Stefano\\'s sister Ilaria became an activist since her brother\\'s death, bringing national attention to the case and continuing to fight for justice. In 2019, two officers, Alessio di Bernardo and Raffaele d\\'Alessandro were sentenced to twelve years in jail for manslaughter.. On 22 July 2020 in Piacenza, seven Carabinieri were arrested after being accused of drug trafficking, receiving stolen goods, extortion, illegal arrest, torture, grievous bodily harm, embezzlement, abuse of office, and fraud. The \"leader\" of the group, officer Montella, arrested and charged people with fake proof of crimes that the detainees never committed, placing in the pockets of the people in custody the drugs that he smuggled. A Moroccan man was illegally arrested by the seven officers; the man accused Montella of punching him several times while in custody and reported that the officer laughed during the torture. Montella later admitted that he carried out the torture after initially trying to accuse only his colleagues. However, many other cases of torture inside the police station and outside during arrests were reported, as in the case of a Nigerian man who was approached by Montella; a photo of the man was taken during the arrest, showing him covered with blood. Montella claimed that the man \"had a fall\" during the arrest; however, prosecutors did not believe Montella\\'s version of the events. A Brazilian woman accused marshal Orlando, one of the charged officers, of being forced to have sex with him through blackmail and intimidation, as the marshal threatened to have her deported back to Brazil. The woman was also beaten at the police station by Orlando; she reported that the seven officers consumed cocaine inside the police station several times, and orgies with prostitutes happened there; Orlando was the one who brought the drugs inside the station. Several prostitutes were also beaten and threatened by the officers. The seven officers were sentenced between three and twelve years in prison.. On 1 July 2021, 52 prison guards were arrested and suspended on the charges of aggravated torture, aggravated ill-treatment and causing multiple injuries to a group of prisoners, who had demanded better Coronavirus protections, at the Santa Maria Capua Vetere prison in Caserta on 6 April 2020. A video footage emerged in which there were shocking scenes of prisoners being kicked, slapped and beaten with truncheons. This happened after a riot erupted in the prison as inmates demanded face masks and Covid-19 tests in reaction to an outbreak of the virus. The inmates were allegedly made to strip, kneel and be beaten by guards who wore helmets to conceal their identity. Latvia. Latvia became an independent republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, consisting of a group of volunteers to protect public order. Policing during this period was quite successful and was assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.. From 1940 to 1991, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were overruled by the Communist regime, which brought in the Soviet militsiya. Due to Soviet ideals on policing that considered criminals to be the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist ideologies. During this time, an imbalance existed between police actions and citizens\\' rights. Despite the lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue, as ustrated by the case where the former nominal head of the militsiya (in practice - the secret police of the KGB of the Latvian SSR) Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment in this time period for genocide against the Latvian people.In 1991, the independence of the state of Latvia was restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the Law on Police on 5 June. This restructured the police into State, Security, and Local Government levels. The Law on Police reiterated ethical requirements, where police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to \"torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment\". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose among the Russian population living in Latvia; in 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality. This hostility towards Russians remained in the following years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after Latvia\\'s independence.. In 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies (LCHRES) found some instances of brutality and \"severe abuse\" within police authorities, especially on persons in custody. Reports showed high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004. For the Latvian community, this meant that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.. Reports from Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study where it set up an anonymous hotline. During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.. Since joining the European Union in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system several times. While the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities did not enact any of their 2007 recommendations. Their 2011 report outlined some cases of police brutality within the prison system, with allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly while being apprehended or at the police station (including during questioning).. Despite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for poor treatment is decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states \"a police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim. The use of spontaneous or -intentioned force, special facilities or weapon shall not be justified\", recognising that the authorities are conscious of police brutality, and given more time, it is likely that the figures will continue to decrease. Luxembourg. The Luxembourg Police force has 1,603 officers and is known as the \"Grand Ducal Police\". The Grand Ducal Police is the primary law enforcement agency in Luxembourg and has been operating since 1 January 2000, when the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (previous Luxembourg military) merged with the police force. Due to Luxembourg\\'s relatively small population of approximately 500,000 people, the Grand Ducal Police are in charge of several duties that are often separated by jurisdictions such as Border Control and Internal Military operations.Police brutality is not perceived to be a serious threat to society in Luxembourg. The European Union\\'s 2014 Anti-Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest incidents of reported police brutality within the European Union. Due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system, and transparency mechanisms, the public also have a deep trust in the Grand Ducal police force.. Laws in Luxembourg specifically distinguish between coercion and force in the 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force. This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this Act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers such as the use of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability, and measure to use force. To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality, numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (the term used for a common officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station. By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. The 2015 Human Rights Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg, suggesting that the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.. Although police brutality is almost nonexistent in Luxembourg, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any potential misconduct by the Grand Ducal Police. Malta. Malta\\'s Police Force (MPF) is one of the oldest in Europe, with the Maltese government taking over the force in 1921 following the grant of self-governance. There are approximately 1,900 members in the Force.Under the Police Act of 1961, Part V deals with the use of force, where\"police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary [...]\" (Article 96); however, according to Article 100, \"It shall be considered as an offence against discipline if a police officer uses force for considerations extraneous to those permitted by law and the circumstances of the case\". As such, Malta recognizes the illegality of police brutality and can prosecute offending officials on these grounds.. Malta is expected to abide by the 2001 European Code of Ethics as a member of the European Union, where \"the police may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective.\"Similarly, the Council of Europe (of which Malta is a member) follows the five principles developed by the European Court of Human Rights, where definition 16 states that police officers \"may use reasonable force when lawfully exercising powers\".In 2008, Lawrence Gonzi (The Minister for Justice and Home Affairs) called upon Martin Scicluna, a former civil servant and currently an expert on security issues at the Prime Minister\\'s Office, to conduct an independent inquiry into 24 March 2008 police brutality incident. The inquiry required the investigation of \"allegations of beatings carried out on detainees at Safi Detention Centre by members of the Detention Service on 24 March 2008 and to make any recommendations necessary in the light of [his] findings\". Following the results of the inquiry of Scicluna, made public by the Maltese Government, it was concluded that \"excessive force was used by Detention Service Personnel\".Scicluna made recommendations that \"appropriate [action] should be taken to reprimand the Detention Service officers involved in this operation and the relevant Senior NCOs for the acts of 25 excessive force used by some personnel in their charge\". Simultaneously, Home Affairs Minister Carm Mifsud Bonnici said \"95 percent of the members of the police force were doing their duties, but the remainder needed to be addressed\", which led to the establishment of the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) to \"maintain and safeguard the integrity of the Malta Police Force through an internal system of investigation that is objective, fair, equitable, impartial and just\", where complaints or allegations on the use of force can be monitored and responded to.. Although Malta has attempted to tackle the police brutality through the implementation of independent systems such as the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), the US Department of State 2010 report on Malta\\'s human rights found that \"authorities detained irregular immigrants under harsh conditions for up to 18 months during the review of their protected status.\" In addition, the 2013 US Department of State report found that although there were no government reports on the use of brutality in detention centers, on 2 December 2013 media reported the sentencing of two former prison guards to five years in prison and another two guards to three months in prison after finding them guilty of beating an escaped prisoner in 2008, illustrating the gradual development of the IAU in limiting the use of police brutality.After the IAU was implemented, the Human Rights Committee has raised questions on the use of force by state officials with respect to the countering of detention center riots, where police were accused of punching and striking detainees. An inquiry was consequently conducted in 2011 and 2012 following riots, resulting in criminal proceedings against the law enforcement officials responsible. In addition, Giacomo Santini and Tina Acketoft (The Chairs of the Migration and Equality Committees of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe) expressed \"grave concern at an increasing number of incidents of state violence against migrants and refugees\". They called upon Maltese authorities to conduct a rapid investigation emphasising the need to forbid violence against migrants and refugees, whether by state parties or by individuals.The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, concerning the conditions of migrants in detention, recommended that the \"State party take appropriate measures to improve detention conditions and refrain from resorting to excessive use of force to counter riots by immigrants in detention centers, and also to avoid such riot\". List of alleged cases. Netherlands. The Netherlands is signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights detailing the limits and responsibilities of police powers, and as such demonstrates a public commitment to the restricted legal use of police powers. These powers include the use of reasonable force to enable the effective discharge of duties, with the stipulation force be used proportionately and only as a last resort.The police force of the Netherlands is divided into 25 regional forces and one central force. A Regional Police Board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. Police accountability procedures include mandatory reporting of any on-duty incident that requires the use of force. The Rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. In 2007 the Rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were related to shootings.While Dutch society has a history of support for liberal values, it has been subject to practicing racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Van der Leun writes that suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident and perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command. This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, where a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage. Current political discourse in the Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far-right political ideologies in recent decades.A notable case in racial profiling and the use of police force occurred in June 2015 with the death of Aruban man Mitch Henriquez. Henriquez died of asphyxiation while in police custody after being suspected of carrying a firearm and being arrested at a music festival in The Hague. The first anniversary of his death in June 2019 provided a catalyst for protests against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European background. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, which led some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest. The five officers alleged to be involved in Hendriquez\\'s death have been suspended but have yet to be charged. Poland. The Polish police (Policja) force aims to \"serve and protect the people, and to maintain public order and security\". Polish laws prohibit torture or degrading treatment and set out punishment for police officers including demotion and removal from the police force. History. A key factor influencing the levels of police brutality in Poland has been the move from a communist state to a democracy. Force was particularly used by the ZOMO squads, which were elite units of Citizens\\' Militia (MO) during the Polish People\\'s Republic. As a result, the opposition branded ZOMO with the nickname \"Communist Gestapo\". It is argued that Poland\\'s transition has resulted in a more transparent system, reducing levels of police brutality. Although police brutality exists within Poland cases are much more likely to be handled by the criminal justice system with a greater chance for resolution through the courts.While there are still instances of police brutality, trust in the police has steadily increased in Poland from 62% to 75% between 2002 and 2008, demonstrating the improvement in trust between the police and the general public.. Although there is a more open police force within Poland, many organizations still have issues against police brutality. The 2013 United States Department of State report on Poland raised several concerns of police brutality; The report cited a case of police officers using violence to acquire a confession for armed robbery in 2012, though it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.In year 2020 Polish women started protesting against new restrictions in abortion law. In response Polish police started arresting, use of gas against protesters and even beating them on the streets. Government states that use of force was necessary, even though there was no reported example of aggression on the side of protesters. Issues with sports fans. In recent years one of the main sources of controversy concerning Polish police brutality has been the use of rubber bullets to disperse uncooperative crowds at sporting events.. In 1998, major riots occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game. Another set of riots occurred in 2015 in response to a pitch invasion during a football match. Although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit in the neck and later died at the hospital. A former police officer justified the use of weapons as a means to combat football hooliganism. Protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic. Issues with Roma. The Polish police also have a history of police brutality within the Roma community. There are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against the Roma by the police. The European Roma Rights Centre argues that investigations into police brutality cases are seldom carried out and that the police brutality against the Roma minority is systematic.One particular case of police brutality against the Romani people occurred in 1998 when the police took four Roma men to a field and beat them. The men that were beaten were hospitalised for broken bones and other injuries; they were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public. Portugal. Portugal is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world. The police force is divided into five main organisations, with the Polícia de Segurança Pública (PSP) having the most prominent urban presence. The PSP has a diverse range of duties and responsibilities, which include protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring democratic legality.. The use of weapons by Portuguese police is permitted only when: [...] absolutely necessary and when less dangerous means have proved ineffective, and provided that their use is proportionate to the circumstances.. This is restrictive on multiple counts; for example, police are not permitted to use their firearms when an offender is running away. Football hooliganism. Portuguese police have adopted an aggressive position in combating football hooliganism. Despite their means being considered disproportionate, the police view the heavy-handed nature of their tactics as a necessary and successful approach towards protecting the community and maintaining social order.. In 2015, a viral video showed a Benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. The footage, filmed by a local television station, showed Jose Magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers. Although the family appeared calm, Magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, while his father was punched in the face twice. More police rushed to the scene to shield the children aged nine and thirteen.. A statement released by the PSP acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack. The officer was later suspended for 90 days by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.The statement also defended policing the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. Riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in Lisbon as fans celebrated Benfica\\'s title victory. The harsh approach was described as sufficient, justified, and necessary to prevent the social disorder from escalating.In a similar incident in 2016, another football club, Sporting Lisbon, complained about \"barbaric\" police assaults on their fans. Racism. There have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal. In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between Portugal\\'s colonial past and modern police racism. According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001; however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.Racially-influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno Lopes was aggressively searched and physically abused. When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the Alfragide police station requesting information on Lopes\\' situation. Upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs. The policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained, mistreated, and mocked them for two days.17 police officers from the Alfragide police station were eventually sent to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging, and aggravated kidnapping. {{Update}} As of October 2018, the trial is ongoing, with victims being heard in court.The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has raised concerns about police mistreatment of minorities in Portugal in all of its reports on the country. In its fifth country report of 2018, ECRI mentions the Alfragide case in connection to the failure of IGAI (Inspeção-Geral da Administração Interna) or officers higher up in the chain of command to stop the abuses. IGAI is currently the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the Ministry of the Interior like the police forces. In its 2018 report, ECRI recommended that such work should be carried out by the country\\'s Ombudsman, an equality body, or by a new and (entirely) independent body that can be created for that purpose.Portuguese people of Roma descent have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. There are several examples publicized by the media: one case from 2007 involved a Roma man and his son. The two walked to the Nelas police station in Porto to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. Two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.An example of police brutality that occurred in 2012 is the night raid of a Roma campsite by the GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana), in Cabanelas, Vila Verde. Some of the people living in the camp, including children and women, were reportedly attacked by GNR officers. Six Roma that were detained in the operation allege that they were later tortured and humiliated in the GNR station of Amares; the GNR denied the accusations, while SOS Racismo promised to file a complaint against the force. The last remnant of overt institutional racism, in Portugal, is article 81 of GNR\\'s regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people, who in general are known to be mostly Roma; the regulation\\'s constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 1980s. Russia. Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of Vladimir Putin in 2012. More attention has been given to the frequency of police brutality shown on posted videos online. Then-president Dmitry Medvedev initiated reforms of the police force in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralising police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give due process to citizens. Proper investigations into police officials are still considered insufficient by Western standards.In 2012, Russia\\'s top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract false confessions from detainees. Police regulations require officers to meet quotas for solving crimes, which encourages false arrests to meet their numbers. In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian police were seen attacking protesters.In the early days, when Russia was part of the Soviet Union, the secret police and authorities used to detain people and send certain people to the gulags. Slovakia. Police brutality in Slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively enacted on the Romani minority. The nation-state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the Romani minority dating back to before the split of Czechoslovakia. It is widely known that the government practiced forced sterilisation of Romani women and the segregation of the Romani into walled-off settlements; these forms of discrimination have filtered down to the police force. Excessive use of force against the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations. The police force has been repeatedly condemned by several organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention and its treatment of suspects in custody.In 2001, a 51-year-old Romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the Mayor of Magnezitovce and his son who works as a police officer. The victim, Karol Sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten after being forcefully removed from his home. While the mayor\\'s son was immediately removed from the police force and the mayor was suspended from his position, the latter was reinstated four months later. In response to this incident, the Minister for Internal Affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality by including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around the effective use of coercion. However, police brutality toward the Roma minority remains a serious issue.. Video footage shot by law enforcement officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by police dogs, with at least two sustaining serious injuries. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour because the boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen; however, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law. The 10 law enforcement officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video inadmissible in court as it was obtained illegally. As the footage was the main piece of evidentiary support for the crime, without it a conviction could not be passed down.Human rights watchdog organisations have raised concerns around police selectivity in making recordings of raids after a raid in the settlement of Vrbica in 2015; the police claimed to have not thought the settlement would be problematic; this raid involved 15 men being seriously injured.It is often the experience of the Roma in regards to pressing charges for police brutality, a counter charge is often threatened by law enforcement in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges. It is generally an effective move as the hostile attitude toward the Roma in Slovakia is so entrenched that lawyers are often reluctant to represent Romani victims. Slovenia. Minority groups in Slovenia, particularly the Roma and any residents from the former Yugoslav Republic face discrimination and sometimes brutality by Slovenian police. The Roma are major targets because of their being stereotyped as an inherently criminal population. They often live in illegal settlements in very low socio-economic conditions, which contributes to their discrimination and their reputation as criminals. They are one of the ethnic minorities from former Yugoslavic states known as \"the erased\" who, after Slovenia declared of independence in 1991, lost all legal status, social, civil, and political rights. This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality. Their rights have not been fully restored yet. Due to their lack of rights and legal status, it is difficult to hold police officers accountable for offences committed against the Romani.. The police have been known to occasionally use excessive force against detainees in prisons, as well as foreigners and other minority groups, though no police officer has ever been arrested or charged. It is argued that authorities turn a blind eye to any allegations that arise because the victims are often from ethnic minorities, and there is a culture of racism within parts of the police force. When investigations are made, they are often ineffective.The worst case of police brutality was the November 2012 protests; political dissatisfaction spurred a series of protests in Maribor, Slovenia. For the most part, the protests were peaceful; the crowds chanted and behaved non-violently for about two hours on 26 November 2012 (also known as, \"the second Maribor uprising\"). However, the violence began when crowds moved towards an area with a heavy police presence. Police used excessive force to disperse the crowds, including tear gas, dragging and beating protesters, police dogs, and mounted police who indiscriminately charged into the crowd. Civilians, protesters, and journalists were all targeted. Authorities attempted to justify the use of force by claiming protesters were violent and the use of force was necessary and not excessive. Slovenian media sources reported that the protest only turned violent after the police started using physical force. This level of violence was unprecedented and entirely unexpected in Slovenia.Since 2003, Slovenian authorities have attempted to rectify this discrimination by introducing a two-day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community. The programme involved teaching the police about Roma culture and their language which helped to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension. The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding the treatment of minorities. It also helped to build trust between the Roma community and the police. Tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme; however, they have been greatly reduced. Spain. With the beginning and spread of several mass movements of protests in 1968, including various regions and cities of Spain united against Francisco Franco\\'s regime, the Francoist dictatorship of Spain repressed the protests and strikes in the country using police brutality and state violence.In post-Francoist Spain (1975–present), two notable demonstrations were the ones that occurred in Barcelona on 27 May 2011, and in Madrid on 25 September 2012. Video footage published online showed the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators on both occasions. Images show officers using handheld batons to repeatedly hit peaceful demonstrators (some of them in the face and neck), rubber bullets, pepper spray, and the injuries caused.Despite public outrage, the Spanish government did not make any attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public; the opposite happened instead: in July 2016, new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code were enforced which limited the right to freedom of assembly and gave police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a \"lack of respect\" towards them. The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers. Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and poor treatment of detainees in police custody.. Amnesty International and ACODI (Acción Contra la Discriminación) have both called out Spain for racial profiling and ethnic discrimination.. ACODI documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims feared police retaliation or believed their complaints would be ignored. This belief is not unfounded; in 2005, Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. Despite eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon\\'s assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.Under Spanish law, the police have the right to check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern. However, African and Latin American immigrants are most frequently targeted, often without a legitimate security concern. \"People who do not \\'look Spanish\\' can be stopped by police as often as four times a day,\" said Izza Leghtas, an Amnesty International researcher. Sweden. According to David Grobgeld of the Center for a Stateless Society, since the REVA (Legally Certain and Efficient Enforcement) project had been applied in Sweden in an attempt to deport illegal immigrants, it had exposed the brutal and illegal methods used by police. Officers have been shown to harass and racially profile non-white Swedes who often live in segregated suburbs. The marginalised such as the poor, homeless, people of colour, users of illicit drugs, and the mentally ill are facing Sweden as a Police State. This has resulted in social disobedience with ordinary people in Sweden updating others on Twitter and Facebook on the whereabouts of police. Examples. In 2013 police shot a man in his own home in front of his wife in the town of Husby, a suburb of Stockholm. The police alleged the man had been wielding a machete and threatening them with it. The Stockholm riots were set off after the Husby shooting, where more than 100 cars were torched. When the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. People said the police called them \"monkeys\" and used batons against them in the clash.In another incident in 2013, an African-born Swede was refused entry into a local club in Malmö for wearing traditional African clothes. The police picked him up and in the process of his arrest broke his arm and locked him in a cell for nearly six hours with no medical aid. Socially excluded groups have been targeted and the result of police investigations often means the police officers are not deemed to be at fault.According to Grobgeld, the common denominator for people on a special police list is being or married to a Romani person. A register of 4029 Romani people is kept by police. The police say the document is a register of criminals and their associates and is used to fight crime in Skåne County despite people being on it that have no connection with Skåne or any association with criminal people. According to Grobgeld, police target apparent ethnicity at Stockholm subways for ID-checks to see if they are illegal immigrants. The police claim that they are \"following orders\", the \"rule of law\" and \"democratic process\".In February 2016, a nine-year-old was accused of not paying for a railway ticket in Malmö. The police ordered the local security guards to stop the child. One guard tackled him to the ground and sat on him. He then pushed the child\\'s face into the pavement hard and covered his mouth. The child can be heard screaming and gasping on the video that has gone viral on the internet. The police then put him in handcuffs. Switzerland. 1999, Zurich: Khaled Abuzarifa died of suffocation after being bound and gagged by his police escort at the Zurich airport.. November 2016, Bex: Hervé Mandundu was shot several times and killed by police, who claim he tried to attack him with a knife. This account is disputed by his neighbors.. October 2017, Lausanne: Lamin Fatty was mistaken for another person with the same name and detained. He was found dead in his jail cell the following day.. February 2018, Lausanne: Mike Ben Peter was held to the ground by police for six minutes. He then collapsed and died of cardiac arrest twelve hours later. There were reports that he was repeatedly kicked by the police in his genital area, and an autopsy confirmed severe bruising in this region. The police officers involved were not suspended, but have been charged with negligent homicide in an ongoing case.. May 2001, Valais: Samson Chukwu died of suffocation as a police officer put his weight on the back of a face-down Chukwu. Authorities originally claimed he died of a heart attack, but an autopsy later showed that postural asphyxiation led to Chukwu\\'s death.. 2001, Bern: Cemal Gomec was attacked by police officers with batons to the head, irritant gas, a shock grenade, rubber bullets. A sedative is said to have led to cardiac arrest which led to his death a few days later. United Kingdom. In 2015 the United Kingdom employed approximately 126,818 police officers in the 43 police forces of England, Wales and the British Transport Police, the lowest number since March 2002. Legislation and treaties. The 1967 Criminal Law Act, the 2008 Common Law and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act, and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) set out the law and acceptable use of force in the UK. The use of unnecessary physical force is in principle an infringement of ECHR Article 3. The use of force should be \"reasonable\" in the circumstances. Physical force is considered appropriate if: it is absolutely necessary for a purpose permitted by law, and. the amount of force used is reasonable and proportionateThis requires a consideration of the degree of force used. Any excessive use of force by a police officer is unlawful and an officer could be prosecuted under criminal law. Findings and statistics. Since 2004/05, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) published complaint statistics reports for England and Wales. In the 2014/15 annual report, the IPCC reported that there were 17 deaths in or following police custody and only one fatal police shooting from 2014 to 2017. These figures more than doubled when the IPCC was first erected. The annual report for 2015/16 was published on 26 July 2016. A total of 37,105 complaints were recorded in 2014/15, marking a 6% increase to the previous year, and a 62% overall increase since 2004/05. Allegations of \"neglect or failure in duty\" accounted for 34% of all allegations recorded while \"other assault\" and \"oppressive conduct\" or harassment made up only 8% and 6% respectively. Public dissatisfaction and discrimination. Despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to file a complaint. The Metropolitan Police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 at 6,828 claims. However, young people and people from black or minority ethnic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.While instances of police brutality in the UK is comparatively less than its US counterpart, there are nonetheless high profile incidents that have received wide media coverage. Examples. In May 2013, 21-year-old Julian Cole was arrested outside a nightclub in Bedford by six police officers. The altercation left Cole in a vegetative state due to a severed spinal cord. Expert evidence indicated that Cole was struck with considerable force on his neck whilst his head was pulled back. Despite calls by the IPCC to suspend the officers, Bedfordshire chief constable Colette Paul refused to place the six police officers on restricted duties despite being under criminal investigation. The Bedfordshire police denied allegations that the use of excessive force on Cole was race-related.. On 20 February 2014, Bedfordshire Police Constables Christopher Thomas and Christopher Pitts, chased Faruk Ali before allegedly knocking him over and punching him in the face outside his family home. Ali was described as an autistic man who had the mental age of a five-year-old. The police officers, who were accused of laughing throughout the ordeal, were cleared of misconduct in public office by the Aylesbury Crown Court. Following an investigation by the IPCC, the officers were fired following breaches of standards of professional conduct including standards of honesty, integrity, authority, equality, and diversity.On 13 July 2016, 18-year-old Mzee Mohammed died in police custody after being detained by Merseyside police at a Liverpool shopping centre. Officers were called to the scene after Mzee was allegedly behaving aggressively and erratically while armed with a knife. After successfully detaining Mzee, the police called an ambulance after Mzee suffered a \"medical episode\" and was pronounced dead. Video evidence surfaced showing Mohammed surrounded by officers and paramedics, seemingly fully unconscious while being placed face down with his hands handcuffed behind his back. Questions remain about how appropriate medical condition could have been administered given how the handcuffs would restrict breathing. Mohammed is the 21st black person to die in police custody in six years. North America. Canada. There have been several high-profile cases of alleged police brutality, including the 2010 G20 Toronto summit protests, the 2012 Quebec student protests, the Robert Dziekański Taser incident, and the shooting of Sammy Yatim. The public incidents in which police judgments or actions have been called into question raised concerns about police accountability and governance.On 16 March 2014, 300 people were arrested in Montreal at a protest against police brutality. United States. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s, anti-war demonstrations, the War on Drugs, and the Global War on Terrorism. In 2014, the UN Committee against Torture condemned police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement in the US, and highlighted the \"frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals\". The United Nations\\' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent\\'s 2016 report noted that \"contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.\"Seven members of the United States Maryland military police were convicted for the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in Iraq. Detainees were abused within the prison by being forced to jump on their naked feet, being videotaped in sexually exploitative positions, having chains around their neck for photos, and being kept naked for days.The United States has developed a notorious reputation for cases of police brutality. The United States has a far higher number of police killings compared to other Western countries. U.S. police killed 1,093 people in 2016 and 1,146 people in 2015, and at least 1,176 people in 2022, the deadliest year on record. Mass shootings have killed 339 people since 2015, whereas police shootings over the same time span claimed the lives of 4,355 people. An FBI homicide report from 2012 observed that while black people represent 13% of the US population, they amounted to 31% of those killed by police, and were responsible for 48% of police murdered. It was found through Kaiser Family Foundation research that almost half of Black Americans believe they have been victimized by law enforcement. The FBI 2019 Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, Table 42 reports that black persons were responsible for 37% of all officers killed from 2012 through 2019.According to a 2021 study published in The Lancet, more than 30,000 people were killed by police in the United States between 1980 and 2018. Around 2,500 of those killed by police from 2015 to 2022 were fleeing. Examples. Breonna Taylor was killed at the age of 26 when police forced entry into the apartment as part of an investigation into drug dealing operations. Officers said that they announced themselves as police before forcing entry, but Walker said he did not hear any announcement, thought the officers were intruders, and fired a warning shot at them and hit Mattingly in the leg, and the officers fired 32 shots in return. Walker was unhurt but Taylor was hit by six bullets and died. On 23 September, a state grand jury found the shooting of Taylor justified but indicted officer Hankison on three counts of wanton endangerment for endangering Taylor\\'s neighbors with his shots.On 25 May 2020, George Floyd, an unarmed African American man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck for over nine minutes (9:29 seconds) while three other officers appeared to restrain his back and legs. In the video, it appears George Floyd screaming \"You are going to kill me man!\" Chauvin was charged with 2nd-degree murder; his three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. The colleagues of Derek Chauvin include Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao. Floyd\\'s murder, captured on video, triggered protests against racial discrimination across the US and the world. In June 2021, former officer Chauvin was found guilty of three counts of murder and manslaughter and received a sentence of 22.5 years in prison. South America. Argentina. Brazil. The police in Brazil have a history of violence against the lower classes. It dates back to the nineteenth century when it primarily served as an instrument to control slaves. In a mostly rural country, the police forces were heavily influenced by local large landowners known as \"colonels\".In the latter half of the twentieth century, the country was heavily urbanized, while over its last military dictatorship state governments became responsible for Brazilian police forces experiencing which became heavily militarized.The militarist approach to dealing with social issues led the country to its highest violence levels and in 2015 Brazil had more violent deaths than the Syrian Civil War, with most people fearing the police. More than 6,160 people were killed by the Brazilian police in 2018. In 2019, the state of Rio de Janeiro alone registered 1,814 killings by members of the police force in 2019, setting a new record. A significant portion of the officers involved had already been charged for crimes previously.Research released by the Forum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública (Brazilian Public Security Forum) in partnership with São Paulo University showed that the Brazilian police killed approximately 6,416 people in 2020. Black and Brown people are 78% of the dead - 5,000 people, most of them men, poor, and aged 14 to 30 years old. It is what Brazilian Black Movement name the genocide of Black Brazilian youth. Rio de Janeiro is the city with the highest rates. According to Rio\\'s Public Security Institute (ISP), in 2019, where 1,814 people were killed in legal police interventions, 1,423 were Black or Brown. The COVID-19 pandemic did not stop or diminish the killings, which increased 27,9% compared to 2019. An ISP report states that Rio\\'s police killed 741 people from January to May – the highest rate in 22 years.. The ISP research reveals the disparities between the number of COVID-19 mitigating actions (36) and police encounters (120) in the first months of the pandemic. Due to this absence of public health politics and the increase of lethal operations in favelas, 17 organizations from the Black movement, human rights, and favelas organizations joined a political party towards entered a petition called ADPF (Arguição de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental) 635, known as \"ADPF das Favelas\" (Favela\\'s ADPF) in Brazil\\'s Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal – STF) demanding actions towards minimizing police terror in the communities. In May 2020, they asked for the immediate suspension of police operations during the pandemic, indicating that continuing such operations would threaten life and dignity. In addition, they cited mortality rates, power abuse cases, and the propriety damages caused by the police raids during a deadly pandemic in poor neighborhoods.. On May 18, 2020, João Pedro Pinto, a 14 years old boy, was killed inside his family\\'s house. According to a witness, he lived in a place with a pool and a barbecue area, where he was with his cousins and friends when the police raid started. According to the survivors, the boys went to the covered area when they noticed that the police helicopter started to shoot. Moments later, the police invaded the place, which the boys informed: “There are only children here.” The police response was throwing two grenades that made the boys run into the house to protect themselves. João Pedro was shot in his belly by a rifle, his body was transported to a place 27 miles away from the crime scene, and the family had access to him after 17 hours. According to the reports and TV news, it was possible to count more than 70 bullet marks inside João Pedro\\'s house. This murder led people to protest in the streets and was the main argument for the ADPF 635 petition, supported by Supreme Courts Minister Edson Fachin in August of the same year.. Afterward, the Court unanimously voted to maintain the decision, which would only authorize operations in \"absolutely exceptional\" cases that needed to be justified for the Public Ministry of the State of Rio de Janeiro. The Supreme Court also stated that in case of authorized operations in the pandemic, \"Exceptional care should be taken, duly identified in writing by the competent authority, so as not to put in risk population\\' provision of public health services and the humanitarian aid activities.\" Even after the pandemic, it has prohibited using helicopters as a platform for shooting and terror, conducting operations near schools and hospitals, and using them as police operational bases. The crime scene must be preserved and must avoid body remotion (by the excuse of supposed rescue). The technical-scientific police must document evidence, reports, and autopsy exams to ensure the possibility of independent review; Investigations must meet the Minnesota Protocol requirements. It must be fast, effective, and complete well as independent, impartial, and transparent.. The decision was celebrated by the group as a mark in the history of justice and lives in favela\\'s struggle. The organizations that joined the political party (PSB – Socialist Brazilian Party) were Rio de Janeiro Public Defense, Fala Akari, Papo Reto Collective, Rede de Comunidades e Movimentos Contra a Violência, Mães de Manguinhos, Redes da Maré, Movimento Negro Unificado, Educafro, Iniciativa Direito à Memória e Justiça Racial, ISER, Justiça Global, Conectas e National Human Rights Concil. Other organizations as Observatório de Favelas, Maré Vive, Instituto Marielle Franco, Cesec, Grupo de Estudo dos Novos Legalismos/UFF e Fogo Cruzado contributed to the lawsuit.In August 2020, the research group named “Grupo de Estudos dos Novos Ilegalismos” (GENI) from Federal Fluminense University in Rio de Janeiro with other civil organizations, stated that after the suspension of police operations by the STF, the mortality rates decreased to 72.5%. Furthermore, the criminality rates also decreased: a  reduction of 47.7% in crimes against life, 37.9% in willful murder homicides, 39% in reduction in crimes against patrimonies, and less 32,1% in vehicle robbery. Nevertheless, the STF decision was not very well received by Rio de Janeiro\\'s police, who complained and accused the decision to make their work more difficult, even with the decrease of criminality. They also did not always obey the order and did raid without the requirements the law demanded. According to the organization Rede de Observatórios, in the first two months of the year, police killed 47 people, 20% more than the same period of 2020.On May 6, 2021, Rio de Janeiro police killed 28 people in Jacarezinho Favela in a raid that was considered a success by police forces and the state of Rio\\'s government. Immediately after the slaughter, human rights activists denounced illegal actions as alteration of the crime scene, invasion of houses, in addition to non-compliance with the protocol demanded by the STF. It is considered the biggest slaughter in the history of the city and is still under investigation. One month later, on June 08th, a young pregnant Black woman was killed by the police in another favela. Kathlen Romeu, 24 years old, four months pregnant, was walking with her grandmother when a police officer shot her. According to the Brazilian Bar Association\\'s Humans Rights Commission (OAB), the operation that killed Kathlen was illegal, and the police officer was hiding in a neighbor\\'s house to ambush criminals. According to the ISP and GENI Group, from January to September 2021, Rio de Janeiro police killed 811 people during their raids. Colombia. Protests against police brutality started in Bogotá, the country\\'s capital, following the death of Javier Ordóñez while in police custody on 9 September 2020. The unrest has since spread to many cities throughout Colombia. As of 12 September 2020, 13 people have died and over 400 have been injured as part of the protests. Chile. In recent years, Chile\\'s police force Carabineros de Chile has been under investigation because of various cases of power abuse and police brutality, particularly towards students participating in riots for better education and the indigenous Mapuche people; countless cases of violence were enacted on this group for allegedly committing crimes; it was later discovered that some Carabineros officers were responsible for these crimes and blamed Mapuches.. One of the recent cases involving the Mapuche was Camilo Catrillanca\\'s death. The first reports of his death came from the Carabineros who claimed that Camilo shot at a police officer and others while being investigated for allegedly stealing three cars. The Carabineros special forces team Comando Jungla was in the Araucanía Region searching for terrorists. After seeing Camilo \"attacking\" policemen with a gun in an attempt to escape, the Carabineros shot Camilo in the head and killed him. It was later discovered that this was not what happened; a partner of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he drove a tractor. Carabineros was asked why they did not have a recording of the officer being shot at by Camilo. The institution responded the officer destroyed the SD card because it had private photos and videos of his wife; most people were not satisfied with the answer. The policeman was later discharged and prosecuted.During the 2019–20 Chilean protests, Carabineros de Chile has caused hundreds of eye mutilations on protesters and random civilians with hardened rubber bullets and tear gas canisters. The most notorious cases are of the victims with complete loss of vision Gustavo Gatica and Fabiola Campillai. Venezuela. During the 2014 Venezuelan protests, multiple human rights organizations condemned the Venezuelan government for its handling of the protests as security forces had reportedly gone beyond typical practices of handling protests, with methods ranging from the use of rubber pellets and tear gas to instances of live ammunition and torture of arrested protestors, according to organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Hundreds of Venezuelans were tortured when detained by Venezuelan authorities.During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, the United Nations Human Rights Office denounced \"widespread and systematic use of excessive force\" against demonstrators, saying security forces and pro-government groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 73 protesters. The UN Human Rights Office described \"a picture of widespread and systematic use of excessive force and arbitrary detentions against demonstrators in Venezuela\". \"Witness accounts suggest that security forces, mainly the national guard, the national police and local police forces, have systematically used disproportionate force to instil fear, crush dissent and to prevent demonstrators from assembling, rallying and reaching public institutions to present petitions\".. The majority of individuals killed during protests died from gunshot wounds, with many resulting from the repression by Venezuelan authorities and assisting pro-government colectivos. A report by Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal documented at least six cases in which Venezuelan security forces raided residential areas and apartment buildings in Caracas and in four different states, usually near barricades built by residents; according to testimonies, officials bursted into houses without warrants, stealing personal belongings and food from residents, as well as beating and arresting them.A report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights specified that non-lethal weapons were used systematically to cause unnecessary injuries, explaining that security forces had fired tear gas canisters directly against protesters at short distances. Mónica Kräuter, a chemist and teacher of the Simón Bolívar University who has studied over a thousand tear gas canisters since 2014, has stated that security forces have fired expired tear gas which, according to her, \"breaks down into cyanide oxide, phosgenes and nitrogens that are extremely dangerous\". Groups such as the Venezuelan Observatory of Health have denounced the use of tear gas fired directly or nearby health centers and hospitals, as well as houses and residential buildings.In a 15 June statement, Human Rights Watch stated that high levels officials of the government, such as José Antonio Benavides Torres, the head of the Bolivarian National Guard; Vladimir Padrino López, the defense minister and the strategic operational commander of the Armed Forces; Néstor Reverol, the interior minister, Carlos Alfredo Pérez Ampueda, director of the Bolivarian National Police; Gustavo González López, the national intelligence director, and Siria Venero de Guerrero, the military attorney general, were responsible for the human rights violations and abuses performed by Venezuelan security forces during the protests. Venezuelan officials have praised authorities for their actions and denied any wrongdoing.. Human rights groups have stated that Venezuelan authorities have used force to gain confessions. Amnesty International maintains that the government has a \"premeditated policy\" to commit violent and lethal acts against protesters, stating that there is \"a planned strategy by the government of President Maduro to use violence and illegitimate force against the Venezuelan population to neutralize any criticism\". The Wall Street Journal reported that a young men had already been tortured at an army base when soldiers piled them into two jeeps and transported them to a wooded area just outside the Venezuelan capital. Foro Penal stated that \"most of the detainees are beaten once they are arrested, while they are being transferred to a temporary detention site where they are to be brought before a judge\", giving one instance with \"a group of 40 people arrested for alleged looting, 37 reported that they were beaten before their hair was forcefully shaved off their heads\". In other examples of abuses, \"15 reported that they were forced to eat pasta with grass and excrement. The regime\\'s officials forced dust from tear gas canisters up their noses to pry open their mouths. They then shoved the pasta with excrement in their mouths and made them swallow it\".

Their rights have not been fully restored yet.[284]Due to their lack of rights and legal status, it is difficult to hold police officers accountable for offences committed against the Romani.The police have been known to occasionally use excessive force against detainees in prisons, as well as foreigners and other minority groups, though no police officer has ever beenarrested or charged.[283][284] It is argued that authorities turn a blind eye to any allegations that arise because the victims are often from ethnic minorities, and there is a culture of racismwithin parts of the police force.[283] When investigations are made, they are often ineffective.[285]\\', \"There have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality inPortugal.[259] In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.[260]Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between Portugal\\'s colonial past and modern police racism.[261] According to activists, police have killed 14young black men since 2001? however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.[25\", \\'Recent protests over disputed labor laws have revealed the extreme nature of police brutality in France, as many videos have surfaced in themedia depicting police using disproportionate force on protesters.

Such a plan was required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.[91]\", \\'Israel [ edit ]This section is an excerpt from Racism in Israel § Police brutality. [ edit ]In April 2015 an Ethiopian soldier in the IDF was the victim of an unprovoked and allegedly racist attack by an Israeli policeman and the attack was caught on video. The soldier, DamasPakedeh, was arrested and accused of attacking the policeman. He believes the incident was racially motivated and that if the video had not been taken, he would have been punished.Likud MK Avraham Neguise called on National Police Chief Yohanan Danino to prosecute the police officer and volunteer, saying they engaged in \"a gross violation of the basic law ofrespecting others and their liberty by those who are supposed to protect us\". The Jerusalem Post notes that in 2015 \"there have been a series of reports in the Israeli press about allegedacts of police brutality against Ethiopian Israelis, with many in the community saying they are unfairly targeted and treated more harshly than other citizens\".[44][45] The incident of policebrutality with Pakedeh and alleged brutality of officials from Israel\\\\\\'s Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration with Walla Bayach, an Israeli of Ethiopian descent,brought the Ethiopian community to protest.

      "{'input': ' Naming. In Afghanistan, the war is usually called the Soviet war in Afghanistan (Pashto: په افغانستان کې شوروی جګړه, romanized: Pah Afghanistan ke Shuravi Jagera; Dari: جنگ شوروی در افغانستان, romanized: Jang-e Shuravi dar Afghanestan). In Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, it is usually called the Afghan war (Russian: Афганская война; Ukrainian: Війна в Афганістані; Belarusian: Афганская вайна; Uzbek: Afgʻon urushi); it is sometimes simply referred to as \"Afgan\" (Russian: Афган), with the understanding that this refers to the war (just as the Vietnam War is often called \"Vietnam\" or just \"\\'Nam\" in the United States). It is also known as the Afghan jihad, especially by the non-Afghan volunteers of the Mujahideen. Background. Russian interest in Central Asia. In the 19th century, the British Empire was fearful that the Russian Empire would invade Afghanistan and use it to threaten the large British colonies in India. This regional rivalry was called the \"Great Game\". In 1885, Russian forces seized a disputed oasis south of the Oxus River from Afghan forces, which became known as the Panjdeh Incident. The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian Afghan Boundary Commission of 1885–87. The Russian interest in Afghanistan continued through the Soviet era, with billions in economic and military aid sent to Afghanistan between 1955 and 1978.Following Amanullah Khan\\'s ascent to the throne in 1919 and the subsequent Third Anglo-Afghan War, the British conceded Afghanistan\\'s full independence. King Amanullah afterwards wrote to Russia (now under Bolshevik control) desiring for permanent friendly relations. Vladimir Lenin replied by congratulating the Afghans for their defence against the British, and a treaty of friendship between Afghanistan and Russia was finalized in 1921. The Soviets saw possibilities in an alliance with Afghanistan against the United Kingdom, such as using it as a base for a revolutionary advance towards British-controlled India.The Red Army intervened in Afghanistan to suppress the Islamic Basmachi movement in 1929 and 1930, supporting the ousted king Amanullah, as part of the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929). The Basmachi movement had originated in a 1916 revolt against Russian conscription during World War I, bolstered by Turkish general Enver Pasha during the Caucasus campaign. Afterwards, the Soviet Army deployed around 120,000–160,000 troops in Central Asia, a force similar to the peak strength of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in size. By 1926–1928, the Basmachis were mostly defeated by the Soviets, and Central Asia was incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1929, the Basmachi rebellion reignited, associated with anti-forced collectivization riots. Basmachis crossed over into Afghanistan under Ibrahim Bek, which gave a pretext for the Red Army interventions in 1929 and 1930. Soviet–Afghan relations post-1920s. The Soviet Union (USSR) had been a major power broker and influential mentor in Afghan politics, its involvement ranging from civil-military infrastructure to Afghan society. Since 1947, Afghanistan had been under the influence of the Soviet government and received large amounts of aid, economic assistance, military equipment training and military hardware from the Soviet Union. Economic assistance and aid had been provided to Afghanistan as early as 1919, shortly after the Russian Revolution and when the regime was facing the Russian Civil War. Provisions were given in the form of small arms, ammunition, a few aircraft, and (according to debated Soviet sources) a million gold rubles to support the resistance during the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. In 1942, the USSR again moved to strengthen the Afghan Armed Forces by providing small arms and aircraft, and establishing training centers in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR. Soviet-Afghan military cooperation began on a regular basis in 1956, and further agreements were made in the 1970s, which saw the USSR send advisers and specialists. The Soviets also had interests in the energy resources of Afghanistan, including oil and natural gas exploration from the 1950s and 1960s. The USSR began to import Afghan gas from 1968 onwards. Afghanistan-Pakistan border. In the 19th century, with the Czarist Russian forces moving closer to the Pamir Mountains, near the border with British India, civil servant Mortimer Durand was sent to outline a border, likely in order to control the Khyber Pass. The demarcation of the mountainous region resulted in an agreement, signed with the Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan, in 1893. It became known as the Durand Line.In 1947, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Mohammed Daoud Khan, rejected the Durand Line, which was accepted as an international border by successive Afghan governments for over half a century.The British Raj also came to an end, and the Dominion of Pakistan gained independence from British India and inherited the Durand Line as its frontier with Afghanistan.. Under the regime of Daoud Khan, Afghanistan had hostile relations with both Pakistan and Iran. Like all previous Afghan rulers since 1901, Daoud Khan also wanted to emulate Emir Abdur Rahman Khan and unite his divided country.. To do that, he needed a popular cause to unite the Afghan people divided along tribal lines, and a modern, well equipped Afghan army which would be used to suppress anyone who would oppose the Afghan government. His Pashtunistan policy was to annex Pashtun areas of Pakistan, and he used this policy for his own benefit.Daoud Khan\\'s irredentist foreign policy to reunite the Pashtun homeland caused much tension with Pakistan, a state that allied itself with the United States. The policy had also angered the non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan, and similarly, the Pashtun population in Pakistan were also not interested in having their areas being annexed by Afghanistan. In 1951, the U.S. State Department urged Afghanistan to drop its claim against Pakistan and accept the Durand Line. 1960s–1970s: Proxy war. In 1954, the United States began selling arms to its ally Pakistan, while refusing an Afghan request to buy arms, out of fear that the Afghans would use the weapons against Pakistan. As a consequence, Afghanistan, though officially neutral in the Cold War, drew closer to India and the Soviet Union, which were willing to sell them weapons. In 1962, China defeated India in a border war, and as a result, China formed an alliance with Pakistan against their common enemy, India, pushing Afghanistan even closer to India and the Soviet Union.. In 1960 and 1961, the Afghan Army, on the orders of Daoud Khan following his policy of Pashtun irredentism, made two unsuccessful incursions into Pakistan\\'s Bajaur District. In both cases, the Afghan army was routed, suffering heavy casualties. In response, Pakistan closed its consulate in Afghanistan and blocked all trade routes through the Pakistan–Afghanistan border. This damaged Afghanistan\\'s economy and Daoud\\'s regime was pushed towards closer alliance with the Soviet Union for trade. However, these stopgap measures were not enough to compensate the loss suffered by Afghanistan\\'s economy because of the border closure. As a result of continued resentment against Daoud\\'s autocratic rule, close ties with the Soviet Union and economic downturn, Daoud Khan was forced to resign by the King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah. Following his resignation, the crisis between Pakistan and Afghanistan was resolved and Pakistan re-opened the trade routes. After the removal of Daoud Khan, the King installed a new prime minister and started creating a balance in Afghanistan\\'s relation with the West and the Soviet Union, which angered the Soviet Union.Ten years later, in 1973, Mohammed Daoud Khan, supported by Soviet-trained Afghan army officers, seized power from the King in a bloodless coup, and established the first Afghan republic. Following his return to power, Daoud revived his Pashtunistan policy and for the first time started proxy warring against Pakistan by supporting anti-Pakistani groups and providing them with arms, training and sanctuaries. The Pakistani government of prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was alarmed by this. The Soviet Union also supported Daoud Khan\\'s militancy against Pakistan as they wanted to weaken Pakistan, which was an ally of both the United States and China. However, it did not openly try to create problems for Pakistan as that would damage the Soviet Union\\'s relations with other Islamic countries, hence it relied on Daoud Khan to weaken Pakistan. They had the same thought regarding Iran, another major U.S. ally. The Soviet Union also believed that the hostile behaviour of Afghanistan against Pakistan and Iran could alienate Afghanistan from the west, and Afghanistan would be forced into a closer relationship with the Soviet Union. The pro-Soviet Afghans (such as the People\\'s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)) also supported Daoud Khan hostility towards Pakistan, as they believed that a conflict with Pakistan would promote Afghanistan to seek aid from the Soviet Union. As a result, the pro-Soviet Afghans would be able to establish their influence over Afghanistan.In response to Afghanistan\\'s proxy war, Pakistan started supporting Afghans who were critical of Daoud Khan\\'s policies. Bhutto authorized a covert operation under MI\\'s Major-General Naseerullah Babar. In 1974, Bhutto authorized another secret operation in Kabul where the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Air Intelligence of Pakistan (AI) extradited Burhanuddin Rabbani, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud to Peshawar, amid fear that Rabbani, Hekmatyar and Massoud might be assassinated by Daoud. According to Baber, Bhutto\\'s operation was an excellent idea and it had hard-hitting impact on Daoud and his government, which forced Daoud to increase his desire to make peace with Bhutto. Pakistan\\'s goal was to overthrow Daoud\\'s regime and establish an Islamist theocracy in its place. The first ever ISI operation in Afghanistan took place in 1975, supporting militants from the Jamiat-e Islami party, led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, attempting to overthrow the government. They started their rebellion in the Panjshir valley, but lack of support along with government forces easily defeating them made it a failure, and a sizable portion of the insurgents sought refuge in Pakistan where they enjoyed the support of Bhutto\\'s government.The 1975 rebellion, though unsuccessful, shook President Daoud Khan and made him realize that a friendly Pakistan was in his best interests. He started improving relations with Pakistan and made state visits there in 1976 and 1978. During the 1978 visit, he agreed to stop supporting anti-Pakistan militants and to expel any remaining militants in Afghanistan. In 1975, Daoud Khan established his own party, the National Revolutionary Party of Afghanistan, and outlawed all other parties. He then started removing members of its Parcham wing from government positions, including the ones who had supported his coup, and started replacing them with familiar faces from Kabul\\'s traditional government elites. Daoud also started reducing his dependence on the Soviet Union. As a consequence of Daoud\\'s actions, Afghanistan\\'s relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated. In 1978, after witnessing India\\'s nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, Daoud Khan initiated a military buildup to counter Pakistan\\'s armed forces and Iranian military influence in Afghan politics. Saur Revolution of 1978. The Marxist People\\'s Democratic Party of Afghanistan\\'s strength grew considerably after its foundation. In 1967, the PDPA split into two rival factions, the Khalq (Masses) faction headed by Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Parcham (Flag) faction led by Babrak Karmal. Symbolic of the different backgrounds of the two factions were the fact that Taraki\\'s father was a poor Pashtun herdsman while Karmal\\'s father was a Tajik general in the Royal Afghan Army. More importantly, the radical Khalq faction believed in rapidly transforming Afghanistan, by violence if necessary, from a feudal system into a Communist society, while the moderate Parcham faction favored a more gradualist and gentler approach, arguing that Afghanistan was simply not ready for Communism and would not be for some time. The Parcham faction favored building up the PDPA as a mass party in support of the Daoud Khan government, while the Khalq faction were organized in the Leninist style as a small, tightly organized elite group, allowing the latter to enjoy ascendancy over the former. In 1971, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul reported that there had been increasing leftist activity in the country, attributed to disillusionment of social and economic conditions, and the poor response from the Kingdom\\'s leadership. It added that the PDPA was \"perhaps the most disgruntled and organized of the country’s leftist groups.\". Intense opposition from factions of the PDPA was sparked by the repression imposed on them by Daoud\\'s regime and the death of a leading PDPA member, Mir Akbar Khyber. The mysterious circumstances of Khyber\\'s death sparked massive anti-Daoud demonstrations in Kabul, which resulted in the arrest of several prominent PDPA leaders. On 27 April 1978, the Afghan Army, which had been sympathetic to the PDPA cause, overthrew and executed Daoud along with members of his family. The Finnish scholar Raimo Väyrynen wrote about the so-called \"Saur Revolution\": \"There is a multitude of speculations on the real nature of this coup. The reality appears to be that it was inspired first of all by domestic economic and political concerns and that the Soviet Union did not play any role in the Saur Revolution\". After this the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) was formed. Nur Muhammad Taraki, General Secretary of the People\\'s Democratic Party of Afghanistan, became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the newly established Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. On 5 December 1978, a treaty of friendship was signed between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. \"Red Terror\" of the revolutionary government. After the revolution, Taraki assumed the leadership, Prime Ministership and General Secretaryship of the PDPA. As before in the party, the government never referred to itself as \"communist\". The government was divided along factional lines, with Taraki and Deputy Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin of the Khalq faction pitted against Parcham leaders such as Babrak Karmal. Though the new regime promptly allied itself to the Soviet Union, many Soviet diplomats believed that the Khalqi plans to transform Afghanistan would provoke a rebellion from the general population that was socially and religiously conservative. Immediately after coming to power, the Khalqis began to persecute the Parchamis, not the least because the Soviet Union favored the Parchami faction whose \"go slow\" plans were felt to be better suited for Afghanistan, thereby leading the Khalqis to eliminate their rivals so the Soviets would have no other choice but to back them. Within the PDPA, conflicts resulted in exiles, purges and executions of Parcham members. The Khalq state executed between 10,000 and 27,000 people, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison, prior to the Soviet intervention. Political scientist Olivier Roy estimated between 50,000 and 100,000 people disappeared during the Taraki–Amin period.. There is only one leading force in the country – Hafizullah Amin. In the Politburo, everybody fears Amin.. During its first 18 months of rule, the PDPA applied a Soviet-style program of modernizing reforms, many of which were viewed by conservatives as opposing Islam. Decrees setting forth changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam, particularly by the powerful landowners harmed economically by the abolition of usury (although usury is prohibited in Islam) and the cancellation of farmers\\' debts. The new government also enhanced women\\'s rights, sought a rapid eradication of illiteracy and promoted Afghanistan\\'s ethnic minorities, although these programs appear to have had an effect only in the urban areas. By mid-1978, a rebellion started, with rebels attacking the local military garrison in the Nuristan region of eastern Afghanistan and soon civil war spread throughout the country. In September 1979, Deputy Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin seized power, arresting and killing Taraki. More than two months of instability overwhelmed Amin\\'s regime as he moved against his opponents in the PDPA and the growing rebellion. Affairs with the USSR after the revolution. Even before the revolutionaries came to power, Afghanistan was \"a militarily and politically neutral nation, effectively dependent on the Soviet Union.\" A treaty, signed in December 1978, allowed the Democratic Republic to call upon the Soviet Union for military support. Following the Herat uprising, the first major sign of anti-regime resistance, General Secretary Taraki contacted Alexei Kosygin, chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, and asked for \"practical and technical assistance with men and armament\". Kosygin was unfavorable to the proposal on the basis of the negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country, and he rejected all further attempts by Taraki to solicit Soviet military aid in Afghanistan. Following Kosygin\\'s rejection, Taraki requested aid from Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet head of state, who warned Taraki that full Soviet intervention \"would only play into the hands of our enemies – both yours and ours\". Brezhnev also advised Taraki to ease up on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime.In 1979, Taraki attended a conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back, he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal was present at the meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki\\'s Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price; however, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki\\'s rule as well as later during Amin\\'s short rule.. Lenin taught us to be merciless towards the enemies of the revolution, and millions of people had to be eliminated in order to secure the victory of the October Revolution.. Taraki and Amin\\'s regime even attempted to eliminate Parcham\\'s leader Babrak Karmal. After being relieved of his duties as ambassador, he remained in Czechoslovakia in exile, fearing for his life if he returned as the regime requested. He and his family were protected by the Czechoslovak StB; files from January 1979 revealed information that Afghanistan sent KHAD spies to Czechoslovakia to find and assassinate Karmal. Initiation of the rebellion. In 1978, the Taraki government initiated a series of reforms, including a radical modernization of the traditional Islamic civil law, especially marriage law, aimed at \"uprooting feudalism\" in Afghan society. The government brooked no opposition to the reforms and responded with violence to unrest. Between April 1978 and the Soviet Intervention of December 1979, thousands of prisoners, perhaps as many as 27,000, were executed at the notorious Pul-e-Charkhi prison, including many village mullahs and headmen. Other members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment and intelligentsia fled the country.Large parts of the country went into open rebellion. The Parcham Government claimed that 11,000 were executed during the Amin/Taraki period in response to the revolts. The revolt began in October among the Nuristani tribes of the Kunar Valley in the northeastern part of the country near the border with Pakistan, and rapidly spread among the other ethnic groups. By the spring of 1979, 24 of the 28 provinces had suffered outbreaks of violence. The rebellion began to take hold in the cities: in March 1979 in Herat, rebels led by Ismail Khan revolted. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were killed and wounded during the Herat revolt. Some 100 Soviet citizens and their families were killed. By August 1979, up to 165,000 Afghans had fled across the border to Pakistan. The main reason the revolt spread so widely was the disintegration of the Afghan army in a series of insurrections. The numbers of the Afghan army fell from 110,000 men in 1978 to 25,000 by 1980. The U.S. embassy in Kabul cabled to Washington the army was melting away \"like an ice floe in a tropical sea\". According to scholar Gilles Dorronsoro, it was the violence of the state rather than its reforms that caused the uprisings. Pakistan–U.S. relations and rebel aid. Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send materiel assistance to the Islamist rebels. Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq\\'s ties with the U.S. had been strained during Jimmy Carter\\'s presidency due to Pakistan\\'s nuclear program and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \"repair our relationships with Pakistan\" in light of the unrest in Iran. According to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Robert Gates, \"the Carter administration turned to CIA ... to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979.\" In March 1979, \"CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC [Special Coordination Committee]\" of the United States National Security Council. At a 30 March meeting, U.S. Department of Defense representative Walter B. Slocombe \"asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, \\'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?\\'\" When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: \"Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck.\" Yet a 5 April memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: \"Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries. The risk was that a substantial U.S. covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"In May 1979, U.S. officials secretly began meeting with rebel leaders through Pakistani government contacts. After additional meetings Carter signed two presidential findings in July 1979 permitting the CIA to spend $695,000 on non-military assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") and on a propaganda campaign targeting the Soviet-backed leadership of the DRA, which (in the words of Steve Coll) \"seemed at the time a small beginning.\" Soviet deployment, 1979–1980. The Amin government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. They requested Soviet troops to provide security and to assist in the fight against the mujahideen (\"Those engaged in jihad\") rebels. After the killing of Soviet technicians in Herat by rioting mobs, the Soviet government sold several Mi-24 helicopters to the Afghan military, and increased the number of military advisers in the country to 3,000. On 14 April 1979, the Afghan government requested that the USSR send 15 to 20 helicopters with their crews to Afghanistan, and on 16 June, the Soviet government responded and sent a detachment of tanks, BMPs, and crews to guard the government in Kabul and to secure the Bagram and Shindand air bases. In response to this request, an airborne battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A. Lomakin, arrived at Bagram on 7 July. They arrived without their combat gear, disguised as technical specialists. They were the personal bodyguards for General Secretary Taraki. The paratroopers were directly subordinate to the senior Soviet military advisor and did not interfere in Afghan politics. Several leading politicians at the time such as Alexei Kosygin and Andrei Gromyko were against intervention.. After a month, the Afghan requests were no longer for individual crews and subunits, but for regiments and larger units. In July, the Afghan government requested that two motorized rifle divisions be sent to Afghanistan. The following day, they requested an airborne division in addition to the earlier requests. They repeated these requests and variants to these requests over the following months right up to December 1979. However, the Soviet government was in no hurry to grant them. Based on information from the KGB, Soviet leaders felt that Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin\\'s actions had destabilized the situation in Afghanistan. Following his initial coup against and killing of Taraki, the KGB station in Kabul warned Moscow that Amin\\'s leadership would lead to \"harsh repressions, and as a result, the activation and consolidation of the opposition.\"The Soviets established a special commission on Afghanistan, comprising the KGB chairman Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev from the Central Committee and Dmitry Ustinov, the Minister of Defence. In late April 1979, the committee reported that Amin was purging his opponents, including Soviet loyalists, that his loyalty to Moscow was in question and that he was seeking diplomatic links with Pakistan and possibly the People\\'s Republic of China (which at the time had poor relations with the Soviet Union). Of specific concern were Amin\\'s supposed meetings with the U.S. chargé d\\'affaires, J. Bruce Amstutz, which were used as a justification for the invasion by the Kremlin.. Information forged by the KGB from its agents in Kabul provided the last arguments to eliminate Amin. Supposedly, two of Amin\\'s guards killed the former General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin himself was portrayed as a CIA agent. The latter is widely discredited, with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and maintaining the pro-Soviet line. Soviet General Vasily Zaplatin, a political advisor of Premier Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of General Secretary Taraki\\'s ministers were responsible for the destabilization. However, Zaplatin failed to emphasize this in discussions and was not heard.During meetings between General Secretary Taraki and Soviet leaders in March 1979, the Soviets promised political support and to send military equipment and technical specialists, but upon repeated requests by Taraki for direct Soviet intervention, the leadership adamantly opposed him; reasons included that they would be met with \"bitter resentment\" from the Afghan people, that intervening in another country\\'s civil war would hand a propaganda victory to their opponents, and Afghanistan\\'s overall inconsequential weight in international affairs, in essence realizing they had little to gain by taking over a country with a poor economy, unstable government, and population hostile to outsiders. However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May–December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops. The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government to retain power much longer; the effects of the Iranian Revolution that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics; Taraki\\'s murder and replacement by Amin, who the Soviet leadership believed had secret contacts within the American embassy in Kabul and \"was capable of reaching an agreement with the United States\"; however, allegations of Amin colluding with the Americans have been widely discredited and it was revealed in the 1990s that the KGB actually planted the story; and the deteriorating ties with the United States after NATO\\'s two-track missile deployment decision in response to Soviet nuclear presence in Eastern Europe and the failure of Congress to ratify the SALT II treaty, creating the impression that détente was \"already effectively dead.\"The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote in 1989: \"The simplest explanation is probably the best. They got sucked into Afghanistan much as the United States got sucked into Vietnam, without clearly thinking through the consequences, and wildly underestimating the hostility they would arouse\". By the fall of 1979, the Amin regime was collapsing with morale in the Afghan Army having fallen to rock-bottom levels, while the mujahideen had taken control of much of the countryside. The general consensus amongst Afghan experts at the time was that it was not a question of if, but when the mujahideen would take Kabul.In October 1979, a KGB Spetsnaz force Zenith covertly dispatched a group of specialists to determine the potential reaction from local Afghans to a presence of Soviet troops there. They concluded that deploying troops would be unwise and could lead to war, but this was reportedly ignored by the KGB chairman Yuri Andropov. A Spetsnaz battalion of Central Asian troops, dressed in Afghan Army uniforms, was covertly deployed to Kabul between 9 and 12 November 1979. They moved a few days later to the Tajbeg Palace, where Amin was moving to.In Moscow, Leonid Brezhnev was indecisive and waffled as he usually did when faced with a difficult decision. The three decision-makers in Moscow who pressed the hardest for an invasion in the fall of 1979 were the troika consisting of Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko; the Chairman of KGB, Yuri Andropov, and the Defense Minister Marshal Dmitry Ustinov. The principal reasons for the invasion were the belief in Moscow that Amin was a leader both incompetent and fanatical who had lost control of the situation, together with the belief that it was the United States via Pakistan who was sponsoring the Islamist insurgency in Afghanistan. Andropov, Gromyko and Ustinov all argued that if a radical Islamist regime came to power in Kabul, it would attempt to sponsor radical Islam in Soviet Central Asia, thereby requiring a preemptive strike. What was envisioned in the fall of 1979 was a short intervention under which Moscow would replace radical Khalqi Communist Amin with the moderate Parchami Communist Babrak Karmal to stabilize the situation. Contrary to the contemporary view of Brzezinski and the regional powers, access to the Persian Gulf played no role in the decision to intervene on the Soviet side.The concerns raised by the Chief of the Soviet Army General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov who warned about the possibility of a protracted guerrilla war, were dismissed by the troika who insisted that any occupation of Afghanistan would be short and relatively painless. Most notably, though the diplomats of the Narkomindel at the Embassy in Kabul and the KGB officers stationed in Afghanistan were well informed about the developments in that country, such information rarely filtered through to the decision-makers in Moscow who viewed Afghanistan more in the context of the Cold War rather than understanding Afghanistan as a subject in its own right. The viewpoint that it was the United States that was fomenting the Islamic insurgency in Afghanistan with the aim of destabilizing Soviet-dominated Central Asia tended to downplay the effects of an unpopular Communist government pursuing policies that the majority of Afghans violently disliked as a generator of the insurgency and strengthened those who argued some sort of Soviet response was required to a supposed \"outrageous American provocation.\" It was assumed in Moscow that because Pakistan (an ally of both the United States and China) was supporting the mujahideen that therefore it was ultimately the United States and China who were behind the rebellion in Afghanistan.. Amin\\'s revolutionary government had lost credibility with virtually all of the Afghan population. A combination of chaotic administration, excessive brutality from the secret police, unpopular domestic reforms, and a deteriorating economy, along with public perceptions that the state was atheistic and anti-Islamic, all added to the government\\'s unpopularity. After 20 months of Khalqist rule, the country deteriorated in almost every facet of life. The Soviet Union believed that without intervention, Amin\\'s government would have been disintegrated by the resistance and the country would have been \"lost\" to a regime most likely hostile to the USSR. Soviet Army intervention and Palace coup. On 31 October 1979, Soviet informants under orders from the inner circle of advisors around Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev relayed information to the Afghan Armed Forces for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment. Meanwhile, telecommunications links to areas outside of Kabul were severed, isolating the capital. The Soviet 40th army launched its initial incursion into Afghanistan on 25 December under the pretext of extending \"international aid\" to its puppet Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Subsequently, on December 27, Soviet troops arrived at Kabul airport, causing a stir among the city\\'s residents. Simultaneously, Amin moved the offices of the General Secretary to the Tajbeg Palace, believing this location to be more secure from possible threats. According to Colonel General Tukharinov and Merimsky, Amin was fully informed of the military movements, having requested Soviet military assistance to northern Afghanistan on 17 December. His brother and General Dmitry Chiangov met with the commander of the 40th Army before Soviet troops entered the country, to work out initial routes and locations for Soviet troops.. On 27 December 1979, 700 Soviet troops dressed in Afghan uniforms, including KGB and GRU special forces officers from the Alpha Group and Zenith Group, occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target, the Tajbeg Palace. The operation began at 19:00, when the KGB-led Soviet Zenith Group destroyed Kabul\\'s communications hub, paralyzing Afghan military command. At 19:15, the assault on Tajbeg Palace began; as planned, General Secretary Hafizullah Amin was assassinated. Simultaneously, other key buildings were occupied (e.g., the Ministry of Interior at 19:15). The operation was fully complete by the morning of 28 December 1979.. The Soviet military command at Termez, Uzbek SSR, announced on Radio Kabul that Afghanistan had been liberated from Amin\\'s rule. According to the Soviet Politburo, they were complying with the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness, and Amin had been \"executed by a tribunal for his crimes\" by the Afghan Revolutionary Central Committee. That committee then installed former Deputy Prime Minister Babrak Karmal as head of government, who had been demoted to the relatively insignificant post of ambassador to Czechoslovakia following the Khalq takeover, and announced that it had requested Soviet military assistance.Soviet ground forces, under the command of Marshal Sergey Sokolov, entered Afghanistan from the north on 27 December. In the morning, the 103rd Guards \\'Vitebsk\\' Airborne Division landed at the airport at Bagram and the deployment of Soviet troops in Afghanistan was underway. The force that entered Afghanistan, in addition to the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, was under command of the 40th Army and consisted of the 108th and 5th Guards Motor Rifle Divisions, the 860th Separate Motor Rifle Regiment, the 56th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, and the 36th Mixed Air Corps. Later on the 201st and 68th Motor Rifle Divisions also entered the country, along with other smaller units. In all, the initial Soviet force was around 1,800 tanks, 80,000 soldiers and 2,000 AFVs. In the second week alone, Soviet aircraft had made a total of 4,000 flights into Kabul. With the arrival of the two later divisions, the total Soviet force rose to over 100,000 personnel. International positions on Soviet invasion. The invasion of a practically defenseless country was shocking for the international community, and caused a sense of alarm for its neighbor Pakistan. Foreign ministers from 34 Muslim-majority countries adopted a resolution which condemned the Soviet intervention and demanded \"the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops\" from the Muslim nation of Afghanistan. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution protesting the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan by a vote of 104–18. According to political scientist Gilles Kepel, the Soviet intervention or invasion was viewed with \"horror\" in the West, considered to be a fresh twist on the geo-political \"Great Game\" of the 19th century in which Britain feared that Russia sought access to the Indian Ocean, and posed a threat to Western security, explicitly violating the world balance of power agreed upon at Yalta in 1945.The general feeling in the United States was that inaction against the Soviet Union could encourage Moscow to go further in its international ambitions. President Jimmy Carter placed a trade embargo against the Soviet Union on shipments of commodities such as grain, while also leading a 66-nation boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The invasion, along with other concurrent events such as the Iranian Revolution and the hostage stand-off that accompanied it showed the volatility of the wider region for U.S. foreign policy. Massive Soviet military forces have invaded the small, nonaligned, sovereign nation of Afghanistan, which had hitherto not been an occupied satellite of the Soviet Union. [...] This is a callous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. [...] If the Soviets are encouraged in this invasion by eventual success, and if they maintain their dominance over Afghanistan and then extend their control to adjacent countries, the stable, strategic, and peaceful balance of the entire world will be changed. This would threaten the security of all nations including, of course, the United States, our allies, and our friends.. Carter also withdrew the SALT-II treaty from consideration before the Senate, recalled the US Ambassador Thomas J. Watson from Moscow, and suspended high-technology exports to the Soviet Union.China condemned the Soviet coup and its military buildup, calling it a threat to Chinese security (both the Soviet Union and Afghanistan shared borders with China), that it marked the worst escalation of Soviet expansionism in over a decade, and that it was a warning to other Third World leaders with close relations to the Soviet Union. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping warmly praised the \"heroic resistance\" of the Afghan people. Beijing also stated that the lacklustre worldwide reaction against Vietnam (in the Sino-Vietnamese War earlier in 1979) encouraged the Soviets to feel free invading Afghanistan.The Warsaw Pact Soviet satellites (excluding Romania) publicly supported the intervention; however a press account in June 1980 showed that Poland, Hungary and Romania privately informed the Soviet Union that the invasion was a damaging mistake.. Military aidWeapons supplies were made available through numerous countries. Before the Soviet intervention, the insurgents received support from the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya and Kuwait, albeit on a limited scale. After the intervention, aid was substantially increased. The United States purchased all of Israel\\'s captured Soviet weapons clandestinely, and then funnelled the weapons to the Mujahideen, while Egypt upgraded its army\\'s weapons and sent the older weapons to the militants. Turkey sold their World War II stockpiles to the warlords, and the British and Swiss provided Blowpipe missiles and Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns respectively, after they were found to be poor models for their own forces. China provided the most relevant weapons, likely due to their own experience with guerrilla warfare, and kept meticulous record of all the shipments. The US, Saudi and Chinese aid combined totaled between $6 billion and $12 billion.. State of the Cold WarIn the wider Cold War, drastic changes were taking place in Southwestern Asia concurrent with the 1978–1979 upheavals in Afghanistan that changed the nature of the two superpowers. In February 1979, the Iranian Revolution ousted the American-backed Shah from Iran, losing the United States as one of its most powerful allies. The United States then deployed twenty ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea including two aircraft carriers, and there were constant threats of war between the U.S. and Iran.American observers argued that the global balance of power had shifted to the Soviet Union following the emergence of several pro-Soviet regimes in the Third World in the latter half of the 1970s (such as in Nicaragua and Ethiopia), and the action in Afghanistan demonstrated the Soviet Union\\'s expansionism.March 1979 marked the signing of the U.S.-backed peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. The Soviet leadership saw the agreement as giving a major advantage to the United States. A Soviet newspaper stated that Egypt and Israel were now \"gendarmes of the Pentagon\". The Soviets viewed the treaty not only as a peace agreement between their erstwhile allies in Egypt and the US-supported Israelis but also as a military pact. In addition, the US sold more than 5,000 missiles to Saudi Arabia, and the USSR\\'s previously strong relations with Iraq had recently soured, as in June 1978 it began entering into friendlier relations with the Western world and buying French and Italian-made weapons, though the vast majority still came from the Soviet Union, its Warsaw Pact satellites, and China.. The Soviet intervention has also been analyzed with the model of the resource curse. The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran saw a massive increase in the scarcity and price of oil, adding tens of billions of dollars to the Soviet economy, as it was the major source of revenue for the USSR that spent 40–60% of its entire federal budget (15% of the GDP) on the military. The oil boom may have overinflated national confidence, serving as a catalyst for the invasion. The Politburo was temporarily relieved of financial constraints and sought to fulfill a long-term geopolitical goal of seizing the lead in the region between Central Asia and the Gulf. December 1979 – February 1980: Occupation and national unrest. The first phase of the war began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and first battles with various opposition groups. Soviet troops entered Afghanistan along two ground routes and one air corridor, quickly taking control of the major urban centers, military bases and strategic installations. However, the presence of Soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country. On the contrary, it exacerbated nationalistic sentiment, causing the rebellion to spread further. Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan\\'s new leadership, charged the Soviets with causing an increase in the unrest, and demanded that the 40th Army step in and quell the rebellion, as his own army had proved untrustworthy. Thus, Soviet troops found themselves drawn into fighting against urban uprisings, tribal armies (called lashkar), and sometimes against mutinying Afghan Army units. These forces mostly fought in the open, and Soviet airpower and artillery made short work of them.The Soviet occupation provoked a great deal of fear and unrest amongst a wide spectrum of the Afghan populace. The Soviets held the view that their presence would be accepted after having rid Afghanistan of the \"tyrannical\" Khalq regime, but this was not to be. In the first week of January 1980, attacks against Soviet soldiers in Kabul became common, with roaming soldiers often assassinated in the city in broad daylight by civilians. In the summer of that year, numerous members of the ruling party would be assassinated in individual attacks. The Soviet Army quit patrolling Kabul in January 1981 after their losses due to terrorism, handing the responsibility over to the Afghan army. Tensions in Kabul peaked during the 3 Hoot uprising on 22 February 1980, when the Soviet soldiers murdered hundreds of protesters. The city uprising took a dangerous turn once again during the student demonstrations of April and May 1980, in which scores of students were killed by soldiers and PDPA sympathizers.The opposition to the Soviet presence was great nationally, crossing regional, ethnic, and linguistic lines. Never before in Afghan history had this many people been united in opposition against an invading foreign power. In Kandahar a few days after the invasion, civilians rose up against Soviet soldiers, killing a number of them, causing the soldiers to withdraw to their garrison. In this city, 130 Khalqists were murdered between January and February 1980.According to the Mitrokhin Archive, the Soviet Union deployed numerous active measures at the beginning of the intervention, spreading disinformation relating to both diplomatic status and military intelligence. These efforts focused on most countries bordering Afghanistan, on several international powers, the Soviet\\'s main adversary, the United States, and neutral countries. The disinformation was deployed primarily by \"leaking\" forged documents, distributing leaflets, publishing nominally independent articles in Soviet-aligned press, and conveying reports to embassies through KGB residencies. Among the active measures pursued in 1980–1982 were both pro- and anti-separatist documents disseminated in Pakistan, a forged letter implying a Pakistani-Iranian alliance, alleged reports of U.S. bases on the Iranian border, information regarding Pakistan\\'s military intentions filtered through the Pakistan embassy in Bangkok to the Carter Administration, and various disinformation about armed interference by India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, Jordan, Italy, and France, among others. Operations against the guerrillas, 1980–1985. The war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the Afghan mujahideen, which the Soviet Army soldiers called \\'Dushman,\\' meaning \\'enemy\\', divided into small groups and waged a guerrilla war in the mountains. Almost 80 percent of the country was outside government control. Soviet troops were deployed in strategic areas in the northeast, especially along the road from Termez to Kabul. In the west, a strong Soviet presence was maintained to counter Iranian influence. Incidentally, special Soviet units would have also performed secret attacks on Iranian territory to destroy suspected Mujahideen bases, and their helicopters then got engaged in shootings with Iranian jets. Conversely, some regions such as Nuristan, in the northeast, and Hazarajat, in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.. Periodically the Soviet Army undertook multi-divisional offensives into Mujahideen-controlled areas. Between 1980 and 1985, nine offensives were launched into the strategically important Panjshir Valley, but government control in the area did not improve. Heavy fighting also occurred in the provinces neighbouring Pakistan, where cities and government outposts were constantly besieged by the Mujahideen. Massive Soviet operations would regularly break these sieges, but the Mujahideen would return as soon as the Soviets left. In the west and south, fighting was more sporadic, except in the cities of Herat and Kandahar, which were always partly controlled by the resistance.. The Soviets did not initially foresee taking on such an active role in fighting the rebels and attempted to play down their role there as giving light assistance to the Afghan army. However, the arrival of the Soviets had the opposite effect as it incensed instead of pacified the people, causing the Mujahideen to gain in strength and numbers. Originally the Soviets thought that their forces would strengthen the backbone of the Afghan army and provide assistance by securing major cities, lines of communication and transportation. The Afghan army forces had a high desertion rate and were loath to fight, especially since the Soviet forces pushed them into infantry roles while they manned the armored vehicles and artillery. The main reason that the Afghan soldiers were so ineffective, though, was their lack of morale, as many of them were not truly loyal to the communist government but simply wanting a paycheck.. Once it became apparent that the Soviets would have to get their hands dirty, they followed three main strategies aimed at quelling the uprising. Intimidation was the first strategy, in which the Soviets would use airborne attacks and armored ground attacks to destroy villages, livestock and crops in trouble areas. The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information, as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the guerrillas and limit their options. Classic search and destroy operations were implemented using Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed. To complement their brute force approach to weeding out the insurgency, the Soviets used KHAD (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the Mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government militia. While it is impossible to know exactly how successful the KHAD was in infiltrating Mujahideen groups, it is thought that they succeeded in penetrating a good many resistance groups based in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. KHAD is thought to have had particular success in igniting internal rivalries and political divisions amongst the resistance groups, rendering some of them completely useless because of infighting. The KHAD had some success in securing tribal loyalties but many of these relationships were fickle and temporary. Often KHAD secured neutrality agreements rather than committed political alignment. The Sarandoy, a KHAD-controlled government militia, had mixed success in the war. Large salaries and proper weapons attracted a good number of recruits to the cause, even if they were not necessarily \"pro-communist\". The problem was that many of the recruits they attracted were in fact Mujahideen who would join up to procure arms, ammunition and money while also gathering information about forthcoming military operations.In 1985, the size of the LCOSF (Limited Contingent of Soviet Forces) was increased to 108,800 and fighting increased throughout the country, making 1985 the bloodiest year of the war. However, despite suffering heavily, the Mujahideen were able to remain in the field, mostly because they received thousands of new volunteers daily, and continued resisting the Soviets. Reforms of the Karmal administration. Babrak Karmal, after the invasion, promised reforms to win support from the population alienated by his ousted predecessors. A temporary constitution, the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, was adopted in April 1980. On paper, it was a democratic constitution including \"right of free expression\" and disallowing \"torture, persecution, and punishment, contrary to human dignity\". Karmal\\'s government was formed of his fellow Parchamites along with (pro-Taraki) Khalqists, and a number of known non-communists/leftists in various ministries.Karmal called his regime \"a new evolutionary phase of the glorious April Revolution,\" but he failed at uniting the PDPA. In the eyes of many Afghans, he was still seen as a \"puppet\" of the Soviet Union. Mujahideen insurrection. In the mid-1980s, the Afghan resistance movement, assisted by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt, the People\\'s Republic of China and others, contributed to Moscow\\'s high military costs and strained international relations. The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan as an integral Cold War struggle, and the CIA provided assistance to anti-Soviet forces through the Pakistani intelligence services, in a program called Operation Cyclone.Pakistan\\'s North-West Frontier Province became a base for the Afghan resistance fighters and the Deobandi ulama of that province played a significant role in the Afghan \\'jihad\\', with Darul Uloom Haqqania becoming a prominent organisational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters. As well as money, Muslim countries provided thousands of volunteer fighters known as \"Afghan Arabs\", who wished to wage jihad against the atheist communists. Notable among them was a young Saudi named Osama bin Laden, whose Arab group eventually evolved into al-Qaeda. Despite their numbers, the contribution has been called a \"curious sideshow to the real fighting,\" with only an estimated 2000 of them fighting \"at any one time\", compared with about 250,000 Afghan fighters and 125,000 Soviet troops. Their efforts were also sometimes counterproductive, as in the March 1989 battle for Jalalabad. Instead of being the beginning of the collapse of the Afghan Communist government forces after their abandonment by the Soviets, the Afghan communists rallied to break the siege of Jalalabad and to win the first major government victory in years, provoked by the sight of a truck filled with dismembered bodies of Communists chopped to pieces after surrendering by radical non-Afghan salafists eager to show the enemy the fate awaiting the infidels. \"This success reversed the government\\'s demoralization from the withdrawal of Soviet forces, renewed its determination to fight on, and allowed it to survive three more years.\"Maoist guerrilla groups were also active, to a lesser extent compared to the religious Mujahideen. Perhaps the most notable of these groups was the Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan (SAMA), which launched skilled guerrilla attacks and controlled some territory north of Kabul in the early years of the war. The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders Faiz Ahmad and Mulavi Dawood in 1986, both committed by the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin Mujahideen faction.. Afghanistan\\'s resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional warlords. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of Mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.. Olivier Roy estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which Mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by Ahmad Shah Massoud of the Panjshir valley north of Kabul. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of Tajik-dominated areas to Afghanistan\\'s northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.. Roy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in Mujahideen organization. In the Pashtun areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal lashkar (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the Mujahideen besieged towns, such as Khost in Paktia province in July 1983. But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower—customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest—proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.Mujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or gendarmerie who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the Persian- and Turkic-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered pirs (saints) for leadership. Extensive Sufi and maraboutic networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.The Mujahideen favoured sabotage operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging power lines, knocking out pipelines and radio stations, blowing up government office buildings, air terminals, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the Mujahideen would often launch 800 rockets per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 shelling attacks on government targets. The Mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The Mujahideen used land mines heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children. They concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking convoys, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the Ministry of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread power failure darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young communist party members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30 km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On 4 September 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.. Mujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, shooting out of automobiles, laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.. In May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet Army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government. Raids inside Soviet territory. In an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey\\'s executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations. The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in spring 1985. In April 1987, three separate teams of Afghan rebels were directed by the ISI to launch coordinated raids on multiple targets across the Soviet border and extending, in the case of an attack on an Uzbek factory, as deep as over 16 kilometres (10 mi) into Soviet territory. In response, the Soviets issued a thinly-veiled threat to invade Pakistan to stop the cross-border attacks, and no further attacks were reported. Media reaction. International journalistic perception of the war varied. Major American television journalists were sympathetic to the Mujahideen. Most visible was CBS News correspondent Dan Rather, who in 1982 accused the Soviet Union of genocide, comparing them to Hitler. Rather was embedded with the Mujahideen for a 60 Minutes report. In 1987, CBS produced a full documentary special on the war.Reader\\'s Digest took a highly positive view of the Mujahideen, a reversal of their usual view of Islamic fighters. The publication praised their martyrdom and their role in entrapping the Soviets in a Vietnam War-style disaster.Leftist journalist Alexander Cockburn was unsympathetic, criticizing Afghanistan as \"an unspeakable country filled with unspeakable people, sheepshaggers and smugglers, who have furnished in their leisure hours some of the worst arts and crafts ever to penetrate the occidental world. I yield to none in my sympathy to those prostrate beneath the Russian jackboot, but if ever a country deserved rape it\\'s Afghanistan.\" Robert D. Kaplan on the other hand, thought any perception of Mujahideen as \"barbaric\" was unfair: \"Documented accounts of mujahidin savagery were relatively rare and involved enemy troops only. Their cruelty toward civilians was unheard of during the war, while Soviet cruelty toward civilians was common.\" Lack of interest in the Mujahideen cause, Kaplan believed, was not the lack of intrinsic interest to be found in a war between a small, poor country and a superpower where a million civilians were killed, but the result of the great difficulty and unprofitability of media coverage. Kaplan noted that \"none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war\", and television cameramen venturing to follow the Mujahideen \"trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved\". In October 1984, the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told Agence France Presse \"that journalists traveling with the mujahidin \\'will be killed. And our units in Afghanistan will help the Afghan forces to do it.\\'\" Unlike Vietnam and Lebanon, Afghanistan had \"absolutely no clash between the strange and the familiar\", no \"rock-video quality\" of \"zonked-out GIs in headbands\" or \"rifle-wielding Shiite terrorists wearing Michael Jackson T-shirts\" that provided interesting \"visual materials\" for newscasts. Soviet exit and change of Afghan leadership, 1985–1989. Foreign diplomatic efforts. As early as 1983, Pakistan\\'s Foreign Ministry began working with the Soviet Union to provide them an exit from Afghanistan, initiatives led by Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan and Khurshid Kasuri. Despite an active support for insurgent groups, Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Soviets in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the possibility of setting up an interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah, but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq due to his stance on the issue of the Durand line.:\\u200a247–248\\u200a In 1984–85, Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan paid state visits to China, Saudi Arabia, Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop a framework. On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Col. General Boris Gromov, who, at the time, was the commander of the 40th Army. April 1985 – January 1987: Exit strategy. The first step of the Soviet Union\\'s exit strategy was to transfer the burden of fighting the Mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces, with the aim of preparing them to operate without Soviet help. During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing artillery, air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.. Under Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d\\'état, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security (KHAD) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with desertions, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.. The decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched Mujahideen positions in the Arghandab District, but the Mujahideen managed to hold their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties. In the spring of 1986, an offensive into the Paktia Province briefly occupied the Mujahideen base at Zhawar at the cost of heavy losses. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and other Muslim-majority countries. Two Heritage Foundation foreign policy analysts, Michael Johns and James A. Phillips, championed Ahmed Shah Massoud as the Afghan resistance leader most worthy of US support under the Reagan Doctrine. May 1986–1988: Najibullah and his reforms. The government of President Karmal, a puppet regime, was largely ineffective. It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime\\'s efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal\\'s inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\" Karmal\\'s consoliation plan only involved those who had not raised arms against the regime, and even demanded Soviet troops to seal the border with Pakistan before any negotiations with Mujahideen. Eventually, the Soviet Union decided to dispose of Karmal from the leadership of Afghanistan.. In May 1986, Mohammed Najibullah, former chief of the Afghan secret police (KHAD), was elected General Secretary and later as President of the Revolutionary Council. The relatively young new leader wasn\\'t known that well to the Afghan population at the time, but he made swift reforms to change the country\\'s situation and win support as devised by experts of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. An eloquent speaker in both the Pashto and Dari languages, Najibullah engaged with elders and presented both himself and the state as Islamic, sometimes backing his speeches with excerpts from the Qur\\'an. A number of prisoners were released, while the night curfew in Kabul that had been in place since 1980 was finally lifted. He also moved against pro-Karmal Parchamites, who were expelled from the Revolutionary Council and the Politburo.President Najibullah launched the \"National Reconciliation\" program at the start of 1987, the goal of which was to unite the nation and end the war that had enveloped the nation for seven years. He expressed willingness to negotiate with the Mujahideen resistance, allow parties other than the PDPA to be active, and indicated that exiled King Zahir Shah could be part of the process. A six-month ceasefire also began in December 1986. His administration was also more open to foreign visitors outside the Soviet bloc. In November 1987, Najibullah convened a loya jirga selected by the authorities which successfully passed a new constitution for Afghanistan, creating a presidential system with an elective bicameral parliament. The constitution declared \"the sacred religion of Islam\" the official religion, guaranteed the democratic rights of the individual, made it legal to form \"political parties\", and promoted equality between the various tribes and nationalities. Despite high expectations, the new policy only had limited impact in regaining support from the population and the resistance, partly because of the high distrust and unpopularity of the PDPA and KHAD, as well as Najibullah\\'s loyalty to Moscow.As part of the new structure, national parliamentary elections were held in 1988 to elect members of the new National Assembly, the first such elections in Afghanistan in 19 years. Negotiations for a coalition. Ex-king Zahir Shah remained a popular figure to most Afghans. Diego Cordovez of the UN also recognized the king as a potential key to a political settlement to the war after the Soviet troops would leave. Polls in 1987 showed that he was a favored figure to lead a potential coalition between the DRA regime and Mujahideen factions, as well as an opposition to the unpopular but powerful guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was strongly against the King\\'s return. Pakistan however was against this and refused to grant the ex-king a visa for potential negotiations with Mujahideen. Pakistan\\'s President Zia ul-Haq and his supporters in the military were determined to put a conservative Islamic ally in power in Kabul. April 1988: The Geneva Accords. Following lengthy negotiations, the Geneva Accords was signed in 1988 between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Supported by the Soviet Union and the United States respectively, the two Asian countries agreed to refrain from any form of interference in each other\\'s territory. They also agreed to give Afghan refugees in Pakistan to voluntarily return. The two superpowers agreed to halt their interference in Afghanistan, which included a Soviet withdrawal.The United Nations set up a special mission to oversee the process. In this way, President Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow\\'s moves toward withdrawal. Among other things the Geneva Accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal. The agreement on withdrawal held, and on 15 February 1989, the last Soviet troops departed on schedule from Afghanistan. January 1987 – February 1989: Withdrawal. The promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev to General Secretary in 1985 and his \\'new thinking\\' on foreign and domestic policy was likely an important factor in the Soviets\\' decision to withdraw. Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union\\'s economy and image with the Glasnost and Perestroika policies. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the U.S. in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev\\'s biggest mistakes. Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place. At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there. The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of Mongolia in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea to the point of an all-out withdrawal in 1988. This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government\\'s decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy – from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.In the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who had not withdrawn yet.. By mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. Sibghatullah Mojaddedi was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then-Vice President of the United States George H. W. Bush, achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.. In September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down two Iranian AH-1J Cobra helicopters which had intruded into Afghan airspace.Operation Magistral was one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets, a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between the towns of Gardez and Khost. This operation did not have any lasting effect on the outcome of the conflict nor on the soiled political and military status of the Soviets in the eyes of the West, but was a symbolic gesture that marked the end of their widely condemned presence in the country with a victory.The first half of the Soviet contingent was withdrawn from 15 May to 16 August 1988, and the second from 15 November to 15 February 1989. In order to ensure a safe passage, the Soviets had negotiated ceasefires with local Mujahideen commanders. The withdrawal was generally executed peacefully except for the operation \"Typhoon\". General Yazov, the Defense Minister of Soviet Union, ordered the 40th Army to violate the agreement with Ahmed Shah Massoud, who commanded a large force in the Panjshir Valley, and attack his relaxed and exposed forces. The Soviet attack was initiated to protect Najibullah, who did not have a ceasefire in effect with Massoud, and who rightly feared an offensive by Massoud\\'s forces after the Soviet withdrawal. General Gromov, the 40th Army Commander, objected to the operation, but reluctantly obeyed the order. \"Typhoon\" began on 23 January and continued for three days. To minimize their own losses, the Soviets abstained from close-range fight. Instead, they used long-range artillery, surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles. Numerous civilian casualties were reported. Massoud had not threatened the withdrawal to this point, and did not attack Soviet forces after they breached the agreement. Overall, the Soviet attack represented a defeat for Massoud\\'s forces, who lost 600 fighters killed and wounded.After the withdrawal of the Soviets, the DRA forces were left fighting alone and had to abandon some provincial capitals, and it was widely believed that they would not be able to resist the Mujahideen for long. However, in the spring of 1989 DRA forces inflicted a major defeat on the Mujahideen at Jalalabad. The United States, having achieved its goal of forcing the Soviet Union\\'s withdrawal from Afghanistan, gradually disengaged itself from the country. Causes of withdrawal. Some of the causes of the Soviet Union\\'s withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to the Afghanistan regime\\'s eventual defeat include. The Soviet Army of 1980 was trained and equipped for large scale, conventional warfare in Central Europe against a similar opponent, i.e. it used armored and motor-rifle formations. This was notably ineffective against small scale guerrilla groups using hit-and-run tactics in the rough terrain of Afghanistan. Also, the Soviet Army\\'s large formations were not mobile enough to engage small groups of Mujahideen fighters that easily merged back into the terrain. The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from \"tactical initiative\", essential in counter insurgency, because it \"tended to upset operational timing\".. The Soviets used large-scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily cleared those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants. The biggest shortcoming here, though, was the fact that once the Soviets engaged the enemy with force, they failed to hold the ground, as they withdrew once their operation was completed. The killing of civilians further alienated the population from the Soviets, with bad long-term effects.. The Soviets did not have enough men to fight a counter-insurgency war (COIN), and their troops had low morale. The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000, but the bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Soviets did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.. Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets overly relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces. Although their special forces and recon infantry units performed very well in combat against the Mujahideen, they would have better served in intelligence gathering.. The concept of a \"war of national liberation\" against a Soviet-sponsored \"revolutionary\" regime was so alien to the Soviet dogma that the leadership could not \"come to grips\" with it. This led to, among other things, a suppression by the Soviet media for several years of the truth about how bad the war was going, which caused a backlash when it was unable to hide it further. Fall of Najibullah government, 1992. After the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the government of Mohammad Najibullah remained in power until April 15, 1992. Najibullah stepped down that day as Mujahideen guerrilla forces moved into Kabul. He attempted to fly to India under the protection of the U.N., but was blocked from leaving at the airport. He then took refuge at a United Nations compound in Kabul. After a bloody, four-year power struggle between different factions of the victorious anti-Najibullah forces, the Taliban took Kabul. They stormed the U.N. compound on September 26, 1996. They eventually tortured and killed Najibullah. Aerial engagements. Afghan and Soviet warplanes in Pakistani airspace. Soviet Union and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force jet fighters and bombers would occasionally cross into Pakistani airspace to target Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. To counter the Soviet jets, the United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan. These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles, and thus they were required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons. On 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 jets intercepted two Su-22M3K belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace. Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was a major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. On 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot. In 1987, the Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged garrisons like the one in Khost. On 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an An-26 cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft. In the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transport helicopters, and another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989. Also in 1987, two PAF F-16 jets ambushed four Mig-23 which were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that the F-16 was shot down by a Mig-23, though the Soviet Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.On 8 August 1988, Colonel Alexander Rutskoy was leading a group of Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in Miramshah, Pakistan. His fighter jet was intercepted and shot down by two PAF F-16. Colonel Alexander Rustkoy landed in Pakistani territory and was captured. He was later exchanged back to the Soviet Union. A month later, around twelve Mig-23 crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure into ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets. The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s, and the Sidewinder fired by one of the F-16s damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to return home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both the Mig-23 were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft were lost that day. The last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988, in which one Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by a Pakistani Air Force jet.During the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan\\'s airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF. In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, an Su-25, and an An-24 while losing only one F-16. Stinger missiles and the \"Stinger effect\". Whether the introduction of the personal, portable, infrared-homing surface-to-air \"Stinger\" missile in September 1986 was a turning point in the war is disputed.. Many Western military analysts credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war. Some military analysts considered it a \"game changer\" and coined the term \"Stinger effect\" to describe it.Congressman Charlie Wilson claimed that before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets, but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one.However, these statistics are based on Mujahideen self-reporting, which is of unknown reliability. A Russian general claimed the United States \"greatly exaggerated\" Soviet and Afghan aircraft losses during the war. According to Soviet figures, in 1987–1988, only 35 aircraft and 63 helicopters were destroyed by all causes. The Pakistan Army fired twenty-eight Stingers at enemy aircraft without a single kill.Many Russian military analysts tend to be dismissive of the impact of the Stinger. Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev decided to withdraw from Afghanistan a year before the Mujahideen fired their first Stinger missiles; Gorbachev was motivated by U.S. sanctions, not military losses. The Stingers did make an impact at first but within a few months flares, beacons, and exhaust baffles were installed to disorient the missiles, while night operation and terrain-hugging tactics tended to prevent the rebels from getting a clear shot. By 1988 the Mujahideen had all but stopped firing them. Stingers also forced Soviet helicopters and ground attack planes to bomb from higher altitudes with less accuracy, but did not bring down many more aircraft than Chinese heavy machine guns and other less sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry. Gorbachev stated in an interview in 2010 that the Stinger did not influence his decision-making process. War crimes. Human Rights Watch concluded that the Soviet Red Army and its communist-allied Afghan Army perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian areas for attack, and killing and torturing prisoners. Several historians and scholars went further, stating that the Afghans were victims of genocide by the Soviet Union. These include American professor Samuel Totten, Australian professor Paul R. Bartrop, scholars from Yale Law School including W. Michael Reisman and Charles Norchi, writer and human rights advocate Rosanne Klass, and scholar Mohammed Kakar.Helen Fein notes that charges of the U.S. committing genocide during the Vietnam War were repeated by several prominent intellectuals, yet comparatively little attention was paid to the allegations of Soviet genocide against the Afghan people. However, Fein argues that the claims against the Soviets have considerably stronger evidentiary support. Fein states that 9% of the Afghan population perished under Soviet occupation (compared to 3.6% of the 1960 population of Vietnam during the U.S. war and approximately 10% of non-Jewish Poles during the Nazi occupation of Poland) and almost half were displaced, with one-third of Afghans fleeing the country. (By contrast, the sustained refugee flows out of Vietnam occurred after the 1975 defeat of South Vietnam, although millions of Vietnamese were internally displaced by the war.) Furthermore, statements by Soviet soldiers and DRA officials (e.g., \"We don\\'t need the people, we need the land!\"; \"if only 1 million people were left in the country, they would be more than enough to start a new society\") and the actual effect of Soviet military actions suggest that depopulation of rural, predominantly Pashtun areas was carried out deliberately in order to deprive the mujahideen of support: 97% of all refugees were from rural areas; Pashtuns decreased from 39% to 22% of the population. The U.S. likely committed war crimes in Vietnam through inconsistent application of its rules of engagement and disproportionate bombardment, but it at least attempted to hold individual soldiers accountable for murder, especially in the case of the only confirmed large-scale massacre committed by U.S. troops (the Mỹ Lai massacre). By contrast, Fein cites two dozen \"corroborated\" massacres perpetrated by the Soviets in Afghanistan, which went unpunished, adding that in some instances \"Soviet defectors have said that there were sanctions against not killing civilians.\" This policy went beyond collective punishment of villages thought to house mujahideen insurgents—which could itself be a war crime—extending even to the targeting of refugee caravans. Fein concludes that regardless of motive, the Soviets evinced an \"intent to destroy the Afghan people\" and plausibly violated sections a, b, c, and e of Article II of the 1951 Genocide Convention. Massacres. The army of the Soviet Union killed large numbers of Afghans to suppress their resistance. In one notable incident the Soviet Army committed mass killing of civilians in the summer of 1980. To separate the Mujahideen from the local populations and eliminate their support, the Soviet army killed many civilians, drove many more Afghans from their homes, and used scorched-earth tactics to prevent their return. They used booby traps, mines, and chemical substances throughout the country. The Soviet army indiscriminately killed combatants and non-combatants to terrorize local populations into submission. The provinces of Nangarhar, Ghazni, Laghman, Kunar, Zabul, Kandahar, Badakhshan, Logar, Paktia and Paktika witnessed extensive depopulation programmes by the Soviet forces. Rape. The Soviet forces abducted Afghan women in helicopters while flying in the country in search of Mujahideen. In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama. Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them. Women who were taken and raped by Soviet soldiers were considered \\'dishonoured\\' by their families if they returned home. Deserters from the Soviet Army in 1984 also reported the atrocities by Soviet troops on Afghan women and children, including rape. Wanton destruction. Irrigation systems, crucial to agriculture in Afghanistan\\'s arid climate, were destroyed by aerial bombing and strafing by Soviet or government forces. In the worst year of the war, 1985, well over half of all the farmers who remained in Afghanistan had their fields bombed, and over one quarter had their irrigation systems destroyed and their livestock shot by Soviet or government troops, according to a survey conducted by Swedish relief experts. Everything was the target in the country, from cities, villages, up to schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, factories and orchards. Soviet tactics included targeting areas which showed support for the Mujahideen, and forcing the populace to flee the rural territories the communists were unable to control. Half of Afghanistan\\'s 24,000 villages were destroyed by the end of the war. Use of chemical weapons. There have also been numerous reports of illegal chemical weapons, including mycotoxins, being used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, often indiscriminately against civilians. Torture. Amnesty International concluded that the communist-controlled Afghan government used widespread torture against inmates (officials, teachers, businessmen and students suspected of having ties to the rebels) in interrogation centers in Kabul, run by the KHAD, who were beaten, subjected to electric shocks, burned with cigarettes and that some of their hair was pulled out. Some died from these harsh conditions. Women of the prisoners were forced to watch or were locked up in the cells with the corpses. The Soviets were accused of supervising these tortures. Looting. The Soviet soldiers were looting from the dead in Afghanistan, including stealing money, jewelry and clothes. During the Red Army withdrawal in February 1989, 30 to 40 military trucks crammed with Afghan historical treasures crossed into the Soviet Union, under orders from General Boris Gromov. He cut an antique Tekke carpet stolen from Darul Aman Palace into several pieces, and gave it to his acquaintances. Foreign involvement. Pro-Mujahideen. The Afghan mujahideen were backed primarily by Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom making it a Cold War proxy war. Out of the countries that supported the Mujahideen, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia offered the greatest financial support. However, private donors and religious charities throughout the Muslim world—particularly in the Persian Gulf—raised considerably more funds for the Afghan rebels than any foreign government; Jason Burke recounts that \"as little as 25 per cent of the money for the Afghan jihad was actually supplied directly by states.\" Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in the war effort and matched the United States\\' contributions dollar-for-dollar in public funds. Saudi Arabia also gathered an enormous amount of money for the Afghan mujahideen in private donations that amounted to about $20 million per month at their peak.Other countries that supported the Mujahideen were Egypt and China. Iran on the other hand only supported the Shia Mujahideen, namely the Persian speaking Shiite Hazaras in a limited way. One of these groups was the Tehran Eight, a political union of Afghan Shi\\'a. They were supplied predominately by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, but Iran\\'s support for the Hazaras nevertheless frustrated efforts for a united Mujahideen front. Pakistan. Shortly after the intervention, Pakistan\\'s military ruler General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq called for a meeting of senior military members and technocrats of his military government. At this meeting, General Zia-ul-Haq asked the Chief of Army Staff General Khalid Mahmud Arif and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Muhammad Shariff to lead a specialized civil-military team to formulate a geo-strategy to counter the Soviet aggression. At this meeting, the Director-General of the ISI at that time, Lieutenant-General Akhtar Abdur Rahman advocated for an idea of covert operation in Afghanistan by arming the Islamic extremist. As for Pakistan, the Soviet war with Islamist mujahideen was viewed as retaliation for the Soviet Union\\'s long unconditional support of regional rival, India, notably during the 1965 and the 1971 wars, which led to the loss of Pakistani territory to the new state of Bangladesh.After the Soviet deployment, Pakistan\\'s military ruler General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq started accepting financial aid from the Western powers to aid the Mujahideen. In 1981, following the election of US President Ronald Reagan, aid for the Mujahideen through Zia\\'s Pakistan significantly increased, mostly due to the efforts of Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson and CIA officer Gust Avrakotos.The Pakistan Navy were involved in the covert war coordinating foreign weapons being funnelled into Afghanistan. Some of the navy\\'s high-ranking admirals were responsible for storing those weapons in their depots.. ISI allocated the highest percentage of covert aid to warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar leader of the Hezb-e-Islami faction. This was based on his record as an effective anti-Soviet military commander in Afghanistan. The other reason was that Hekmatyar and his men had \"almost no grassroots support and no military base inside Afghanistan\", and thus more \"dependent on Zia-ul-Haq\\'s protection and financial largesse\" than other Mujahideen factions. In retaliation for Pakistan\\'s assistance to the insurgents, the KHAD Afghan security service, under leader Mohammad Najibullah, carried out (according to the Mitrokhin Archives and other sources) a large number of operations against Pakistan. In 1987, 127 incidents resulted in 234 deaths in Pakistan. In April 1988, an ammunition depot outside the Pakistani capital of Islamabad was blown up killing 100 and injuring more than 1000 people. The KHAD and KGB were suspected in the perpetration of these acts. Soviet fighters and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force bombers occasionally bombed Pakistani villages along the Pakistani-Afghan border. The target of Soviet and Afghan fighters and bombers were Afghan refugees camps on Pakistan side of the border. These attacks are known to have caused at least 300 civilian deaths and extensive damage. Sometimes they got involved in shootings with the Pakistani jets defending the airspace.Many secular Pakistanis outside of the government were worried about fundamentalists guerrillas in Afghanistan, such as Hekmatyar, receiving such a high amount of aid, would lead to bolster conservative Islamic forces in Pakistan and its military.Pakistan took in millions of Afghan refugees (mostly Pashtun) fleeing the Soviet occupation. Although the refugees were controlled within Pakistan\\'s largest province, Balochistan under then-martial law ruler General Rahimuddin Khan, the influx of so many refugees – believed to be the largest refugee population in the world – spread into several other regions.. All of this had a heavy impact on Pakistan and its effects continue to this day. Pakistan, through its support for the Mujahideen, played a significant role in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet military personnel from Afghanistan. United States. In the late 1970s, Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send material assistance to the Islamist rebels. Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq\\'s ties with the U.S. had been strained during Jimmy Carter\\'s presidency due to Pakistan\\'s nuclear program. Carter told National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \"repair our relationships with Pakistan\" in light of the unrest in Iran. Carter insisted that this \"Soviet aggression\" could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to US influence in the Persian Gulf region. The U.S. was also worried about the USSR gaining access to the Indian Ocean by coming to an arrangement with Pakistan. The Soviet air base outside of Kandahar was only thirty minutes flying time by strike aircraft or naval bomber to the Persian Gulf. It \"became the heart of the southernmost concentration of Soviet soldier\" in the 300-year history of Russian expansion in central Asia.Brzezinski, known for his hardline policies on the Soviet Union, became convinced by mid-1979 that the Soviets were going to invade Afghanistan regardless of U.S. policy due to the Carter administration\\'s failure to respond aggressively to Soviet activity in Africa. Despite the risk of unintended consequences, support for the Mujahideen could be an effective way to prevent Soviet aggression beyond Afghanistan (particularly in Brzezinski\\'s native Poland). In July 1979, Carter signed two presidential findings permitting the CIA to spend $695,000 on non-military assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") and on a propaganda campaign targeting the Soviet-backed leadership of the DRA, which (in the words of Steve Coll) \"seemed at the time a small beginning.\" Pakistan\\'s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was used as an intermediary for most of these activities to disguise the sources of support for the resistance in a program called Operation Cyclone.The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Stansfield Turner and the CIA\\'s Directorate of Operations (DO) contemplated sending lethal arms from U.S. stocks to the mujahideen as early as late August 1979, but this idea was ultimately not implemented until after the Soviet invasion in December. The first shipment of U.S. weapons intended for the Mujahideen reached Pakistan on 10 January 1980.. Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson became obsessed with the Afghan cause. In 1982 he visited the Pakistani leadership, and was taken to a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp to see first hand the conditions and the Soviet atrocities. After his visit he was able to leverage his position on the House Committee on Appropriations to encourage other Democratic congressmen to vote for CIA Afghan war money. Wilson teamed with CIA manager Gust Avrakotos and formed a team of a few dozen insiders who greatly enhanced support for the Mujahideen. With Ronald Reagan as president he then greatly expanded the program as part of the Reagan Doctrine of aiding anti-Soviet resistance movements abroad. To execute this policy, Reagan deployed CIA Special Activities Division paramilitary officers to equip the Mujahideen forces against the Soviet Army. Avrakotos hired Michael G. Vickers, the CIA\\'s regional head who had a close relationship with Wilson and became a key architect of the strategy. The program funding was increased yearly due to lobbying by prominent U.S. politicians and government officials, such as Wilson, Gordon J. Humphrey, Fred Iklé, and William J. Casey. Under the Reagan administration, U.S. support for the Afghan Mujahideen evolved into a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy, called the Reagan Doctrine, in which the U.S. provided military and other support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua.The CIA gave the majority of their weapons and finances to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar\\'s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin who also received the lion\\'s share of aid from the Saudis. There was recurrent contact between the CIA and Afghan commanders, especially by agent Howard Hart, and Director of Central Intelligence William J. Casey personally visited training camps on several occasions. There was also direct Pentagon and State Department involvement which led to several major Mujahideen being welcomed to the White House for a conference in October 1985. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar declined the opportunity to meet with Ronald Reagan, but Mohammad Yunus Khalis and Abdul Haq were hosted by the president. CIA agents are also known to have given direct cash payments to Jalaluddin Haqqani.The arms included FIM-43 Redeye and 9K32 Strela-2 shoulder-fired, antiaircraft weapons that they initially used against Soviet helicopters. Michael Pillsbury, a Pentagon official, and Vincent Cannistraro pushed the CIA to supply the Stinger missile to the rebels. This was first supplied in 1986; Wilson\\'s good contact with Zia was instrumental in the final go-ahead for the Stinger introduction. The first Hind helicopter was brought down later that year. The CIA eventually supplied nearly 500 Stingers (some sources claim 1,500–2,000) to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, and 250 launchers. The impact of the Stinger on the outcome of the war is contested, nevertheless some saw it more of a \"force multiplier\" and a morale booster.. Overall financially the U.S. offered two packages of economic assistance and military sales to support Pakistan\\'s role in the war against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. By the war\\'s end more than $20 billion in U.S. funds were funnelled through Pakistan. In total, the combined U.S., Saudi, and Chinese aid to the mujahideen is valued at between $6–12 billion. Controversially $600 million went to Hekmatyar\\'s Hezb-i-Islami party which had the dubious distinction of never winning a significant battle during the war. They also killed significant numbers of Mujahideen from other parties, and eventually took a virulently anti-Western line. Cyclone nevertheless was one of the CIA\\'s longest and most expensive covert operations.The full significance of the U.S. sending aid to the Mujahideen prior to the intervention is debated among scholars. Some assert that it directly, and even deliberately, provoked the Soviets to send in troops. According to Coll\\'s dissenting analysis, however: \"Contemporary memos—particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion—make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail. ... Given this evidence and the enormous political and security costs that the invasion imposed on the Carter administration, any claim that Brzezinski lured the Soviets into Afghanistan warrants deep skepticism.\" A 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History found that \"a Soviet military intervention was neither sought nor desired by the Carter administration ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\" Historian Elisabeth Leake adds, \"the original provision was certainly inadequate to force a Soviet armed intervention. Instead it adhered to broader US practices of providing limited covert support to anti-communist forces worldwide\".The US attempted to buy back the Stinger missiles, with a $55 million program launched in 1990 to buy back around 300 missiles (US$183,300 each). United Kingdom. Throughout the war, Britain played a significant role in support of the US and acted in concert with the U.S. government. While the US provided far more in financial and material terms to the Afghan resistance, the UK played more of a direct combat role – in particular the Special Air Service — supporting resistance groups in practical manners. This turned out to be Whitehall\\'s most extensive covert operation since the Second World War.. Unlike the U.S., British aid to the Afghan resistance began before the Soviet invasion was actually launched, working with chosen Afghani forces during the Afghan government\\'s close ties to the Soviet Union in the late seventies. Within three weeks of the invasion this was stepped up – cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong sent a note to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State Peter Carrington and \"C\", the head of MI6 arguing the case for military aid to \"encourage and support resistance\". Support was approved by the British government who then authorised MI6 to conduct operations in the first year of the Soviet occupation, coordinated by MI6 officers in Islamabad in liaison with the CIA and the ISI.. Thatcher visited Pakistan in October 1981 and met President Zia-ul-Haq, toured the refugee camps close to the Afghan border and then gave a speech telling the people that the hearts of the free world were with them and promised aid. The Kremlin responded to the whole incident by blasting Thatcher\\'s \"provocation aimed at stirring up anti-Soviet hysteria.\" Five years later two prominent Mujahideen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdul Haq, met Thatcher in Downing Street.MI6 helped the CIA by activating long-established British networks of contacts in Pakistan. MI6 supported the hardline Islamic group Jamiat-e Islami commanded by Ahmad Shah Massoud commander in the Panjshir Valley. With comparatively little support from Pakistan\\'s ISI and the CIA the British were the primary means of support for Massoud. Despite the CIA\\'s doubts on him he nevertheless became a key MI6 ally and would become an effective fighter. They sent an annual mission of two of their officers as well as military instructors to Massoud and his fighters. They stayed for three weeks or more in the mountains moving supplies to Massoud under the noses of the Pakistanis who insisted on maintaining control. The team\\'s most important contribution was help with organisation and communication via radio equipment. The Cheltenham-based GCHQ intercepted and translated Soviet battle plan communications which was then relayed to the Afghan resistance. MI6 also helped to retrieve crashed Soviet helicopters from Afghanistan – parts of which were carried on mules.In the Spring of 1986, Whitehall sent weapons clandestinely to some units of the Mujahideen, and made sure their origins were open to speculation. The most notable of these was the Blowpipe missile launchers. These had proved a failure in the Falklands War and had been mothballed by the British army, but were available on the international arms market. Around fifty Launchers and 300 Missiles were delivered and the system nevertheless proved ineffective; thirteen missiles were fired for no hits and it was eventually supplanted by the US Stinger missile. The mujahideen were also sent hundreds of thousands of old British army small arms, mostly Lee Enfield rifles, some of which were purchased from old Indian Army stocks. They also included limpet mines which proved the most successful, destroying Soviet barges on their side of the Amu River.In 1983 the Special Air Service were sent in to Pakistan and worked alongside their SSG, whose commandos guided guerrilla operations in Afghanistan in the hope officers could impart their learned expertise directly to the Afghans. Britain also directly trained Afghan forces, much of which was contracted out to private security firms, a policy cleared by the British Government. The main company was Keenie Meenie Services (KMS Ltd) led by former SAS officers. In 1985 they helped train Afghans in sabotage, reconnaissance, attack planning, arson, how to use explosive devices and heavy artillery such as mortars. One of these men was a key trainer, a former senior officer in the royal Afghan army, Brigadier General Rahmatullah Safi – he trained as many as 8,000 men. As well as sending Afghan commando units to secret British bases in Oman to train; KMS even sent them to Britain. Disguised as tourists, selected junior commanders in the Mujahideen were trained in three week cycles in Scotland, northern and southern England on SAS training grounds.The UK\\'s role in the conflict entailed direct military involvement not only in Afghanistan, but the Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union. MI6 organised and executed \"scores\" of psyop attacks in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, on Soviet troop supplies which flowed from these areas. These were the first direct Western attacks on the Soviet Union since the 1950s. MI6 also funded the spread of radical and anti-Soviet Islamic literature in the Soviet republics. China. During the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and the USSR resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing for the opponent\\'s enemies. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King\\'s rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China\\'s then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the Mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack. At the same time relations with the United States had cooled considerably that by 1980 Washington had begun to supply China with a variety of weapons. They even reached an agreement of two joint tracking and listening stations in Xinjiang.China may have given support to Tajik and Kazakh insurgents even before the 1978 coup. But the Chinese also requested before the Soviet intervention that Pakistan not permit Chinese arms it had received to be sent to the Afghan guerrillas.The Chinese People\\'s Liberation Army provided training, arms organisation and financial support. Anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers and machine guns, valued at hundreds of millions, were given to the Mujahideen by the Chinese. Throughout the war Chinese military advisers and army troops trained upwards of several thousand Mujahideen inside Xinjiang and along the Pakistani border. Overall, Chinese aid exceeded $400 million. Pro-Soviet. Prior to the Soviet Union\\'s move on Afghanistan the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet\\'s allies, were not consulted. Eastern European troops did not take part in the invasion or occupation of Afghanistan. In the end, the Soviets would have nothing more than limited political support from the Warsaw Pact countries. Romania went further and broke with its Warsaw Pact allies and abstained when the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops. The only other communist country, North Korea, also refused to endorse the invasion partly because China was supporting the Mujahideen, so they had to create a fine political balance between them and the Soviets. The allies of the Soviet Union that gave support to the intervention were Angola, East Germany, Vietnam and India. According to a report in the Times, forces of Bulgaria, Cuba and Czechoslovakia fought the rebels as well. East Germany. East Germany is reported to have supported the communist government of Afghanistan. East Germany is said to have hosted Mohammad Najibullah for about four weeks. India. India, a close ally of the Soviet Union, endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and by the end of the hostilities, offered to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan government. India did not condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan as India was excessively dependent on the Soviet Union for its military and security, and it has been said that \"the failure of the Indian government to publicly condemn the invasion, its support of the Soviet puppet regime of Kabul, and its hostile vision of the resistance have created major stumbling blocks in Afghan-Indian relations.\" India also opposed a UN resolution condemning the intervention. Impact. Soviet personnel strengths and casualties. Between 25 December 1979, and 15 February 1989, a total of 620,000 soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000–104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other KGB sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of MVD Internal Troops, and police forces. A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue collar jobs.. The total official fatalities of the Soviet Armed Forces, frontier, and internal security troops came to 14,453. Other estimates give a figure of 26,000 killed Soviet soldiers. Soviet Army formations, units, and HQ elements lost 13,833, KGB sub-units lost 572, MVD formations lost 28, and other ministries and departments lost 20 men. During this period 312 servicemen were missing in action or taken prisoner; 119 were later freed, of whom 97 returned to the USSR and 22 went to other countries.. Of the troops deployed, 53,753 were wounded, injured, or sustained concussion and 415,932 fell sick. A high proportion of casualties were those who fell ill. This was because of local climatic and sanitary conditions, which were such that acute infections spread rapidly among the troops. There were 115,308 cases of infectious hepatitis, 31,080 of typhoid fever, and 140,665 of other diseases. Of the 11,654 who were discharged from the army after being wounded, maimed, or contracting serious diseases, 10,751 men, were left disabled.Material losses were as follows:. 451 aircraft (includes 333 helicopters). 147 tanks. 1,314 IFV/APCs. 433 artillery guns and mortars. 11,369 cargo and fuel tanker trucks.In early 1987 a CIA report estimated that, from 1979 to 1986, the Soviet military spent 18 billion rubles on the war in Afghanistan (not counting other costs incurred to the Soviet state such as economic and military aid to the DRA). The CIA noted that this was the equivalent of US$50 billion ($115 billion in 2019 USD). The report credited the relatively low cost to the small size of the Soviet deployment and the fact that the supply lines to Afghanistan were very short (in some cases, easier and cheaper than internal USSR lines). Military aid to the DRA\\'s armed forces totaled 9.124 billion rubles from 1980 to 1989 (peaking at 3.972 billion rubles in 1989). Financial and economic aid were also significant; by 1990, 75% of the Afghan state\\'s income came from Soviet aid. Casualties and destruction in Afghanistan. Civilian death and destruction from the war was massive and detrimental. Estimates of Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 to 2,000,000. By one estimate, at least 800,000 Afghans were killed during the Soviet occupation. 5 million Afghans fled to Pakistan and Iran, 1/3 of the prewar population of the country, and another 2 million were displaced within the country, making it one of the largest refugee crises in history. In the 1980s, half of all refugees in the world were Afghan. In his report, Felix Ermacora, the UN Special Rapporteur to Afghanistan, enumerated 32,755 killed civilians, 1,834 houses and 74 villages destroyed, and 3,308 animals killed in the first nine months of 1985. Data cited by the World Bank shows that Afghanistan\\'s population declined from 13.4 million (1979) to 11.8 million (1989) during the decade of Soviet occupation.R. J. Rummel, an analyst of political killings, estimated that Soviet forces were responsible for 250,000 democidal killings during the war and that the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan was responsible for 178,000 democidal killings. He also assumed that overall a million people died during the war. There were also a number of reports of large scale executions of hundreds of civilians by Soviet and DRA soldiers. Noor Ahmed Khalidi calculated that 876,825 Afghans were killed up until 1987. Historian John W. Dower somewhat agrees with this estimate, citing 850,000 civilian fatalities, while the military fatalities \"certainly totaled over 100,000\". Marek Sliwinski estimated the number of war deaths to be much higher, at a median of 1.25 million, or 9% of the entire pre-war Afghan population. Scholars John Braithwaite and Ali Wardak accept this in their estimate of 1.2 million dead Afghans. However, Siddieq Noorzoy presents an even higher figure of 1.71 million deaths during the Soviet-Afghan war. Overall, between 6.5%–11.5% of Afghanistan\\'s population is estimated to have perished in the war. Anti-government forces were also responsible for some casualties. Rocket attacks on Kabul\\'s residential areas caused more than 4,000 civilian deaths in 1987 according to the UN\\'s Ermacora.Along with fatalities were 1.2 million Afghans disabled (Mujahideen, government soldiers and noncombatants) and 3 million maimed or wounded (primarily noncombatants).. The population of Afghanistan\\'s second largest city, Kandahar, was reduced from 200,000 before the war to no more than 25,000 inhabitants, following a months-long campaign of carpet bombing and bulldozing by the Soviets and Afghan communist soldiers in 1987. Land mines had killed 25,000 Afghans during the war and another 10–15 million land mines, most planted by Soviet and government forces, were left scattered throughout the countryside. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated in 1994 that it would take 4,300 years to remove all the Soviet land mines in Afghanistan, which continued to kill hundreds of people on yearly basis.A great deal of damage was done to the civilian children population by land mines. A 2005 report estimated 3–4% of the Afghan population were disabled due to Soviet and government land mines. In the city of Quetta, a survey of refugee women and children taken shortly after the Soviet withdrawal found child mortality at 31%, and over 80% of the children refugees to be unregistered. Of children who survived, 67% were severely malnourished, with malnutrition increasing with age.Critics of Soviet and Afghan government forces describe their effect on Afghan culture as working in three stages: first, the center of customary Afghan culture, Islam, was pushed aside; second, Soviet patterns of life, especially amongst the young, were imported; third, shared Afghan cultural characteristics were destroyed by the emphasis on the so-called Soviet nationalities system, with the outcome that the country was split into different ethnic groups, with no language, religion, or culture in common.The Geneva Accords of 1988, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in early 1989, left the Afghan government in ruins. The accords had failed to address adequately the issue of the post-occupation period and the future governance of Afghanistan. The assumption among most Western diplomats was that the Soviet-backed government in Kabul would soon collapse; however, this was not to happen for another three years. During this time the Interim Islamic Government of Afghanistan (IIGA) was established in exile. The exclusion of key groups such as refugees and Shias, combined with major disagreements between the different Mujahideen factions, meant that the IIGA never succeeded in acting as a functional government.Before the war, Afghanistan was already one of the world\\'s poorest countries. The prolonged conflict left Afghanistan ranked 170 out of 174 in the UNDP\\'s Human Development Index, making Afghanistan one of the least developed countries in the world.. Once the Soviets withdrew, US interest in Afghanistan slowly decreased over the following four years, much of it administered through the DoD Office of Humanitarian Assistance, under the then Director of HA, George M. Dykes III. With the first years of the Clinton Administration in Washington, DC, all aid ceased. The US decided not to help with reconstruction of the country, instead handing the interests of the country over to US allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Pakistan quickly took advantage of this opportunity and forged relations with warlords and later the Taliban, to secure trade interests and routes. The ten years following the war saw much ecological and agrarian destruction—from wiping out the country\\'s trees through logging practices, which has destroyed all but 2% of forest cover country-wide, to substantial uprooting of wild pistachio trees for the exportation of their roots for therapeutic uses, to opium agriculture.Captain Tarlan Eyvazov, a soldier in the Soviet forces during the war, stated that the Afghan children\\'s future is destined for war. Eyvazov said, \"Children born in Afghanistan at the start of the war... have been brought up in war conditions, this is their way of life.\" Eyvazov\\'s theory was later strengthened when the Taliban movement developed and formed from orphans or refugee children who were forced by the Soviets to flee their homes and relocate their lives in Pakistan. The swift rise to power, from the young Taliban in 1996, was the result of the disorder and civil war that had warlords running wild because of the complete breakdown of law and order in Afghanistan after the departure of the Soviets.The CIA World Fact Book reported that as of 2004, Afghanistan still owed $8 billion in bilateral debt, mostly to Russia, however, in 2007 Russia agreed to cancel most of the debt. Refugees. 5.5 million Afghans were made refugees by the war—a full one third of the country\\'s pre-war population—fleeing the country to Pakistan or Iran. Another estimate states 6.2 million refugees. By the end of 1981, the UN High Commission for Refugees reported that Afghans represented the largest group of refugees in the world.A total of 3.3 million Afghan refugees were housed in Pakistan by 1988, some of whom continue to live in the country up until today. Of this total, about 100,000 were based in the city of Peshawar, while more than 2 million were located in other parts of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (then known as the North-West Frontier Province). At the same time, close to two million Afghans were living in Iran. Over the years Pakistan and Iran have imposed tighter controls on refugees which have resulted in numerous returnees. In 2012 Pakistan banned extensions of visas to foreigners. Afghan refugees have also settled in India and became Indian citizens over time. Some also made their way into North America, the European Union, Australia, and other parts of the world. The photo of Sharbat Gula placed on National Geographic cover in 1985 became a symbol both of the 1980s Afghan conflict and of the refugee situation. Effect on Afghan society. The legacy of the war introduced a culture of guns, drugs and terrorism in Afghanistan. The traditional power structure was also changed in favor of the powerful Mujahideen militias.. “In present-day Afghanistan the groups of clergy, community elders, intelligentsia, and the military cannot be seen.”. The militarization transformed the society in the country, leading to heavily armed police, private bodyguards, and openly armed civil defense groups becoming the norm in Afghanistan both during the war and decades thereafter.The war also altered the ethnic balance of power in the country. While Pashtuns were historically politically dominant since the modern foundation of the Durrani Empire in 1747, many of the well-organized pro-Mujahideen or pro-government groups consisted of Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras. With Pashtuns increasingly politically fragmented, their influence on the state was challenged. Aftermath. Weakening of the Soviet Union. According to scholars Rafael Reuveny and Aseem Prakash, the war contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union by undermining the image of the Red Army as invincible, undermining Soviet legitimacy, and by creating new forms of political participation. On the other hand, the costs for the Soviet Union were not overwhelmingly large compared to other commitments. The CIA estimated in 1987 that the  costs amounted to about 2.5 percent of the Soviet military spending per year. According to historian Sergey Radchenko there is no evidence that the Afghanistan war bankrupted the USSR. The Soviet Union spent about $7.5 billion between 1984 and 1987 but this number was negligible compared to the annual military budget of roughly $128 billion. The decision to withdraw was made based on a number of political factors. The studies about the dissolution of the Soviet Union by historians Stephen Kotkin and Vladislav Zubok identify mainly internal reasons for the collapse and mention the Afghanistan war only in passing.The war created a cleavage between the party and the military in the Soviet Union, where the efficacy of using the Soviet military to maintain the USSR\\'s overseas interests was now put in doubt. In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army\\'s defeat. Some Russian leaders began to doubt the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Hungary in 1956, and East Germany in 1953). As the war was viewed as \"a Soviet war fought by non Soviets against Afghans\", outside of the Soviet Union it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afgantsy), which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press and media, which continued under glasnost. Civil war. The war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. General Secretary Mohammed Najibullah\\'s government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992. Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the Mujahideen\\'s weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah\\'s government successfully defended itself against Mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 proposed a peace plan in cooperation with the leader of Afghanistan, Mohammad Najibullah, for the joint cutoff of Soviet and American aid to the government and guerrillas respectively, to result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations. Najibullah sought American cooperation in achieving a political solution. However the newly elected administration of George H. W. Bush rejected the plan, expecting to win the war through battle. Almost immediately after the Soviet withdrawal, the Mujahideen attacked the eastern city of Jalalabad in a plan instigated by Hamid Gul of Pakistan\\'s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). Both the Americans and Pakistanis expected Jalalabad to rapidly fall to the guerrillas and lead to a final victorious attack in Kabul. The Afghan Army proved their capability without Soviet troops as they managed to restrain the Mujahideen attack, resulting in a major defeat for the Mujahideen.The victory at Jalalabad gave Najibullah\\'s government confidence that it could achieve a political solution, specifically one involving former communists and moderates from the opposition. Along with the Afghan and Soviet governments, China also publicly said that it supported the creation of a \"broad-based\" government, and Iran also supporting a negotiated peaceful solution – both China and Iran being guerrilla-backing countries. But the United States and Pakistan remained committed to a military solution. In addition, the Afghan government could claim that Jalalabad\\'s bombardment, in which thousands of civilians lost their lives and much of the city damaged, was masterminded by the United States and Pakistan, using American weaponry.In December 1990, the United States and the Soviet Union came close to an agreement to end arms supplies to the sides in the civil war, but a date could not be agreed. Two years after the Soviet withdrawal, the guerrillas only gained one provincial capital, Tarinkot, and its surrender was arranged by local tribal leaders. However, in March 1991, the guerrillas managed to win over a city for the first time: Khost, which was nicknamed \"Little Russia\" due to the city\\'s high support of local communist officials. However the guerrillas were unable to fully defeat the Afghan Army as expected by the United States and Pakistan, and neither could the Najibullah government win on the battlefield. This situation ended following the 1991 August Coup in the Soviet Union – according to Russian publicist Andrey Karaulov, the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia\\'s refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Boris Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo. The defection of General Abdul Rashid Dostam and his Uzbek militia, in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah\\'s control of the state. In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the Mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.. Civil war continued when the former Mujahideen guerrillas, which were never under a united command during the period from 1979 to 1992, failed to create a functioning unity government in 1992. The civil war continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the 1990s, eventually leading to Taliban rule.Grain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure. Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline. During the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Afghanistan\\'s natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage. Restoration of gas production has been hampered by internal strife and the disruption of traditional trading relationships following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Extremism and international terrorism. Following the Soviet withdrawal, some of the foreign volunteers (including Osama bin Laden\\'s al-Qaeda) and young Afghan refugees, went on to continue violent jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan and abroad. Some of the thousands of Afghan Arabs who left Afghanistan went on to become \"capable leaders, religious ideologues and military commanders,\" who played \"vital roles\" as insurgents or terrorists in places such as Algeria, Egypt, Bosnia and Chechnya. Tens of thousands of Afghan refugee children in Pakistan were educated in madrassas \"in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor\", and went on to fill the ranks and leadership of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Sipah-e-Sahaba in Pakistan. The groups embodied new varieties of Political Islam – \"Salafi jihadism\" among the foreign volunteers, and a \"hybrid\" Deobandi jihadism among the madrassa-educated.Afghanistan\\'s General Secretary Najibullah, before his ouster by the Mujahideen in 1992, told a visiting US academic that \"Afghanistan in extremist hands would be a center of instability.\" It has been claimed that the chaos could have been avoided had the Bush administration been willing to support the Najibullah and Soviet proposals of a coalition government with the guerrillas, instead of a total military solution. Najibullah also told the International Herald Tribune that \"if fundamentalism comes to Afghanistan, war will continue for many years. Afghanistan will be turned into a center of terrorism.\". As many as 35,000 non-Afghan Muslim fighters went to Afghanistan between 1982 and 1992. Thousands more came and did not fight but attended schools with \"former and future fighters\".. These \"Afghan-Arabs\" had a marginal impact on the jihad against the Soviets, but a much greater effect after the Soviets left and in other countries. (After the Soviets left, training continued and \"tens of thousands\" from \"some 40 nations\" came to prepare for armed insurrections \"to bring the struggle back home\". ). The man instrumental not only in generating international support but also in inspiring these volunteers to travel to Afghanistan for the jihad was a Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood cleric, Abdullah Azzam. Touring the Muslim world and the United States, he inspired young Muslims with stories of miraculous deeds, such as Mujahideen who defeated vast columns of Soviet troops virtually single-handedly, angels riding into battle on horseback, and falling bombs intercepted by birds.When back in the volunteer camps and training centers that he helped set up around Peshawar, Pakistan, Azzam exercised a \"strong influence\". He preached the importance of jihad: \"those who believe that Islam can flourish [and] be victorious without Jihad, fighting, and blood are deluded and have no understanding of the nature of this religion\"; of not compromising: \"Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues\"; and that Afghanistan was only the beginning: jihad would \"remain an individual obligation\" for Muslims until all other formerly-Muslim lands—\"Palestine, Bukhara, Lebanon, Chad, Eritrea, Somalia, the Philippines, Burma, South Yemen, Tashkent, Andalusia\"—were reconquered. The volunteers also influenced each other. Many \"unexpected\" religious-political ideas resulted from the \"cross-pollination\" during the \"great gathering\" of Islamists from dozens of countries in the camps and training centers. One in particular was a \"variant of Islamist ideology based on armed struggle and extreme religious vigour\", known as Salafi jihadism.When the Soviet Union fell shortly after their withdrawal from Afghanistan, the volunteers were \"exultant\", believing that—in the words of Osama bin Laden—the credit for \"the dissolution of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,\" (Soviet economic troubles and United States aid to Mujahideen notwithstanding). They eagerly sought to duplicate their jihad in other countries. Three such countries were Bosnia, Algeria and Egypt. In Bosnia the Salafi jihadist Afghan Arabs fought against Bosnian Serb and Croat militias but failed to establish a Salafi state. In Algeria and Egypt thousand of volunteers returned and fought but were even less successful. In Algeria Salafi jihadist helped lead and fight for the GIA, deliberately killing thousands of civilians. In Egypt the Al-Gama\\'a al-Islamiyya killed more than a thousand people between 1990 and 1997 but also failed to overthrow the government. Spread of extremism in Pakistan. Among the approximately three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, thousands of children were educated in madrasa boarding schools financed by aid from the US and Gulf monarchies. Since that aid was distributed according to the conservative Islamist ideological criteria of Pakistan\\'s President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and Saudi Arabia (and ignoring native Afghan traditions), the schools were part of networks of the favored Hizb-e-Islami party and the Pakistan Deobandi.  (Iran provided similar help to Shia Islamist groups and punishments to moderate Shia nationalist Afghans.). Cut off from families and local traditions, the madrassa students were \"educated to put Deobandi doctrines into action through obedience to the fatwas produced in the madrassas in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor.\" As the Afghan students came of age, they formed \"the mainstay\" of the Taliban in Afghanistan and of the anti-Shia Sipah-e-Sahaba Sunni terror group in Pakistan. But unlike the traditionally non-violent Deobandi, this \"hybrid movement\" embraced the violence of jihad, and unlike the Islamists of Hizb-e-Islami they were uninterested in \"islamizing modernity\" of western knowledge or in western knowledge at all. The culture of religious purification, absolute obedience to leaders, and disinterest in anything else, is thought to explain the willingness of Hizb-e-Islami-trained soldiers to bombard Kabul with artillery and kill thousands of civilians, reassured by their commander that the civilians they killed would \"be rewarded\" in heaven if they were \"good Muslims\".. From 2008 to 2014 \"thousands of Shia\" have been killed by Sunni extremists according to Human Rights Watch. \"Blowback\" of the U.S.. Blowback, or unintended consequences of funding the Mujahideen, was said to have come to the United States in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the September 11 attacks. In the 1993 bombing, all of the participants in the bombing \"either had served in Afghanistan or were linked to a Brooklyn-based fund-raising organ for the Afghan jihad\" that was later \"revealed to be al-Qaeda\\'s de facto U.S. headquarters\". Principals in the 2001 attack – Osama Bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – had both fought in Afghanistan, and bin Laden was a lieutenant of Abdullah Azzam. His group, al-Qaeda, returned to Afghanistan to take refuge with the Taliban after being expelled from Sudan. Before the 9/11 attack, al-Qaeda had bombed two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, and nearly sank the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. However, no direct U.S. aid to Bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established. Media and popular culture. Within Afghanistan, war rugs were a popular form of carpet designs woven by victims of the war. Perception in Afghanistan. The war has left a controversial legacy for Afghan people. The Mujahideen Victory Day is an annual holiday in Afghanistan on 28 April, however it is a controversial event to Afghans. Some Afghans honor the fighters and sacrifice made by the Mujahideen to defeat a major power, but others view the victory as a prelude to the brutal 1990s civil war that divided the country politically and ethnically.Many Afghans see their victory in the war as a source of pride. Atta Muhammad Nur, a former commander of the Mujahideen, says that the war was a victory for Afghans but also the former Soviet bloc for bringing \"freedom\" to peoples and states oppressed by Moscow. However, other Afghans hold the view that the infighting that followed and the rise of the Taliban undermined the victory in the war. Role of the United States. Pro-Mujahideen Afghans had seen the United States as the main power to help their cause in the Soviet–Afghan War. However, after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a growing number of Afghans started blaming the United States for miseries. This was cited as a result of continued American arming and funding of rebels against the pro-Soviet administration in Kabul. Throughout 1989 and 1990, many rebel rocket attacks were fired, nowhere near military targets, that killed dozens of Afghan civilians. Many Afghans also reportedly felt that the U.S. caused the rise of the Taliban by sending billions of dollars in funding for the rebels while leaving the country in Pakistan\\'s hands after 1992. One Afghan ex-prisoner who was affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Kabul told the Chicago Tribune in 2001: Afghan people have good memories of the Americans. During the Russian invasion everybody knows that America helped us to get the Russians out. But when Russia collapsed, they had no more interest and they left us alone Perception in the former Soviet Union. The war left a long legacy in the former Soviet Union and following its collapse. Along with losses, it brought physical disabilities and widespread drug addiction throughout the USSR.The remembrance of Soviet soldiers killed in Afghanistan and elsewhere internationally are commemorated annually on 15 February in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Veterans of the war are often referred to as афганцы (Afgantsy) in Russian. Russian Federation. Commemorating the intervention of 25 December 1979, in December 2009, veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan were honoured by the Duma or Parliament of the Russian Federation. On 25 December, the lower house of the parliament defended the Soviet war in Afghanistan on the 30th anniversary of its start, and praised the veterans of the conflict. Differing assessments of the war \"mustn\\'t erode the Russian people\\'s respect for the soldiers who honestly fulfilled their duty in implementing tasks to combat international terrorism and religious extremists\".Duma member Semyon Bagdasarov (socialist A Just Russia) advocated that Russia had to reject Western calls for stronger assistance to the US-led ISAF-coalition in Afghanistan and also had to establish contacts with the \"anti-Western forces\"; the Taliban, in case they regain power.In November 2018, Russian lawmakers from the ruling United Russia and Communist parties jointly approved a draft resolution seeking to justify the Soviet–Afghan War as well as declare null and void the 1989 resolution passed by the Congress of People\\'s Deputies of the Soviet Union which condemned the invasion. Communist lawmaker Nikolay Kharitonov hailed the decision as a victory for \"historical truth\". Russia\\'s actions were criticized as historical revisionism. Ukraine. About 25 percent of Soviet servicemen in Afghanistan were Ukrainian, numbering 160,000 of which more than 3,000 died and dozens more went missing. Uzbekistan. The war affected many families in post-Soviet Uzbekistan who had lost children. Some 64,500 young men from the Uzbek SSR were drafted in the war. At least 1,522 were killed and more than 2,500 left disabled. The former Uzbekistani president Islam Karimov described the Afghan war as a \"major mistake\" of the Soviet Union. Belarus. The Soviet–Afghan War has caused grief in the memories of Belarusians, but remains a topic rarely discussed in public. It was the last war the country took part in prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 28,832 Belarusian natives were involved in the campaign and 732 died. Most casualties were under 20 years old.The Soviet invasion is considered by many Belarusians as a shameful act, and some veterans have refused to accept medals. Many veterans have had cold relations with the Belarusian regime of Alexander Lukashenko, accusing the government of depriving them of benefits. One Afghanistan veteran, Mikalaj Autukhovich, is considered a political prisoner of the present regime of Belarus. Moldova. Around 12,500 residents of the Moldavian SSR served during the war. Of those, 301 Moldovans died in the war. The Union of Veterans of the War in Afghanistan of the Republic of Moldova is a veteran\\'s group based in Moldova that advocates for the well-being of veterans. On 15 May 2000, after the Government\\'s initiative to abolish benefits for veterans of the war in Afghanistan, sympathizers went to Great National Assembly Square. In 2001, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, which came to power, radically changed the position of all veterans in the country. 15 February is celebrated as the Day of Commemoration of those killed in the War in Afghanistan.

      "{'input': ' History. Origins. The Stowe gardens and estate are located close to the village of Stowe in Buckinghamshire, England. John Temple, a wealthy wool farmer, purchased the manor and estate in 1589. Subsequent generations of Temples inherited the estate, but it was with the succession of Sir Richard Temple that the gardens began to be developed, after the completion of a new house in 1683.Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, inherited the estate in 1697, and in 1713 was given the title Baron Cobham. During this period, both the house and the garden were redesigned and expanded, with leading architects, designers and gardeners employed to enhance the property. The installation of a variety of temples and classical features was illustrated the Temple family\\'s wealth and status. The temples are also considered as a humorous reference to the family motto: TEMPLA QUAM DILECTA (\\'How beautiful are the Temples\\'). 1690s to 1740s. In the 1690s, Stowe had a modest early Baroque parterre garden, but it has not survived, as it was altered and adapted as the gardens were progressively remodelled. Within a relatively short time, Stowe became widely renowned for its magnificent gardens created by Lord Cobham. Created in three main phases, the gardens at Stowe show the development of garden design in 18th-century England. They are also the only gardens where Charles Bridgeman, William Kent, and Capability Brown all made significant contributions to the character and design.From 1711 to c.1735 Charles Bridgeman was the garden designer, whilst John Vanbrugh was the architect from c.1720 until his death in 1726. They designed an English Baroque park, inspired by the work of London, Wise and Switzer. After Vanbrugh\\'s death James Gibbs took over as architect in September 1726. He also worked in the English Baroque style. Bridgeman was notable for the use of canalised water at Stowe.In 1731 William Kent was appointed to work with Bridgeman, whose last designs are dated 1735. After Bridgeman, Kent took over as the garden designer. Kent had already created the noted garden at Rousham House, and he and Gibbs built temples, bridges, and other garden structures, creating a less formal style of garden. Kent\\'s masterpiece at Stowe is the innovative Elysian Fields, which were \"laid out on the latest principles of following natural lines and contours\". With its Temple of Ancient Virtue that looks across to his Temple of British Worthies, Kent\\'s architectural work was in the newly fashionable Palladian style.In March 1741, Capability Brown was appointed head gardener and he lived in the East Boycott Pavilion. He had first been employed at Stowe in 1740, to support work on the water schemes on site. Brown worked with Gibbs until 1749 and with Kent until the latter\\'s death in 1748. Brown departed in the autumn of 1751 to start his independent career as a garden designer. At that time, Bridgeman\\'s octagonal pond and 11-acre (4.5 ha) lake were extended and given a \"naturalistic\" shape. A Palladian bridge was added in 1744, probably to Gibbs\\'s design. Brown also reputedly contrived a Grecian Valley which, despite its name, was an abstract composition of landform and woodland. He also developed the Hawkwell Field, with Gibbs\\'s most notable building, the Gothic Temple, within. The Temple is one of the properties leased from the National Trust by The Landmark Trust, who maintain it as a holiday home. As Loudon remarked in 1831, \"nature has done little or nothing; man a great deal, and time has improved his labours\". 1740s to 1760s. Earl Temple, who had inherited Stowe from his uncle Lord Cobham, turned to a garden designer called Richard Woodward after Brown left. Woodward had worked at Wotton House, the Earl\\'s previous home. The work of naturalising the landscape started by Brown was continued under Woodward and was accomplished by the mid-1750s.At the same time Earl Temple turned his attention to the various temples and monuments. He altered several of Vanburgh\\'s and Gibbs\\'s temples to make them conform to his taste for Neoclassical architecture. To accomplish this he employed Giovanni Battista Borra from July 1750 to c.1760. Also at this time several statues and temples were relocated within the garden, including the Fane of Pastoral Poetry.Earl Temple made further alterations in the gardens from the early 1760s with alteration to both planting and structure, and several older structures were removed, including the Witches House. Several designs for this period are attributed to his cousin Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford. Camelford\\'s most notable design was the Corinthian Arch. 1770s onwards. Famed as a highly fashionable garden, by 1777 some visitors, such as the 2nd Viscount Palmerston, complained that the gardens were \"much behind the best modern ones in points of good taste\".The next owner of Stowe, the Marquess of Buckingham, made relatively few changes to the gardens, as his main contribution to the Stowe scheme was the completion of Stowe House\\'s interior. Vincenzo Valdrè was his architect and built a few new structures such as The Menagerie, with its formal garden and the Buckingham Lodges at the southern end of the Grand Avenue, and most notably the Queen\\'s Temple. 19th-century Stowe. The last significant changes to the gardens were made by the next two owners of Stowe, the 1st and 2nd Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos. The former succeeded in buying the Lamport Estate in 1826, which was immediately to the east of the gardens, adding 17 acres (6.9 ha) to the south-east of the gardens to form the Lamport Gardens.From 1840 the 2nd Duke\\'s gardener Mr Ferguson created rock structures and water features in the new Lamport Gardens. The architect Edward Blore was also employed to build the Lamport Lodge and Gates as a carriage entrance, and also remodelled the Water Stratford Lodge at the start of the Oxford Avenue.In 1848 the 2nd Duke was forced to sell the house, the estate and the contents in order to begin to pay off his debts. The auction by Christie\\'s made the name of the auction house. In 1862, the third Duke of Buckingham and Chandos returned to Stowe and began to repair several areas of the gardens, including planting avenues of trees. In 1868 the garden was re-opened to the public. 20th century. The remaining estate was sold in 1921 and 1922. In 1923 Stowe School was founded, which saved the house and garden from destruction. Until 1989 the landscape garden was owned by Stowe School, who undertook some restoration work, including the development of a restoration plan in the 1930s. The first building to be restored was the Queen\\'s Temple, repairs to which were funded by a public appeal launched by the future Edward VIII. In the 1950s repairs were made to the Temple of Venus, the Corinthian Arch and the Rotondo. Stowe Avenue was replanted in 1960.. In the 1960s significant repairs were made to buildings, such as the Lake Pavilions and the Pebble Alcove. Other works included replanting several avenues, repairs to two-thirds of the buildings, and the reclamation of six of the lakes (only the Eleven Acre Lake was not tackled). As a result of this the school was recognised for its contribution to conservation and heritage with awards in 1974 and 1975.The National Trust first became significantly involved in Stowe in 1965, when John Workman was invited to compile a plan for restoration. In 1967, 221 acres were covenanted to the National Trust and in 1985 the trust purchased Oxford Avenue, the first time it had bought land to enhance a site not under its ownership. In 1989 much of the garden and the park was donated to the National Trust, after generous donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and an anonymous benefactor, which enabled an endowment for repairs to be created. In 1993 the National Trust successfully completed an appeal for £1 million, with the aim of having the garden restored by 2000. Parallel to fund-raising, extensive garden, archaeological and biological surveys were undertaken. Further repairs were undertaken to many monuments in the 1990s. The Stowe Papers, some 350,000 documents relating to the estate, are in the collection of the Huntington Library. 21st century. In 2012 the restoration of the historic New Inn was finished, providing enhanced visitor services. In 2015, the National Trust began a further programme of restoration, which included the recreation of the Queens Theatre, the return of many statues to former locations in the Grecian Valley, and the return of the Temple of Modern Virtue to the Elysian Fields.Accommodating the requirements of a 21st-century school within a historic landscape continues to create challenges. In the revised Buckinghamshire, in the Pevsner Buildings of England series published in 2003, Elizabeth Williamson wrote of areas of the garden being \"disastrously invaded by school buildings.\" In 2021, plans for a new Design, Technology and Engineering block in Pyramid Wood provoked controversy. The school\\'s plans were supported by the National Trust but opposed by Buckinghamshire County Council’s own planning advisors, as well as a range of interest groups including The Gardens Trust. Despite objections from the council’s independent advisor, and an appeal to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the plans were approved in 2022. Layout. Approaching Stowe Gardens. In 2012, with the renovation and re-opening of the New Inn, visitors to Stowe Gardens have returned to using the historic entrance route to the site which was used by tourists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Most will drive between the Buckingham Lodges, before approaching the site along the Grand Avenue and turning right in front of the Corinthian Arch.Significant monuments on the route in, include: The Buckingham Lodges. The Buckingham Lodges are 2.25 miles south-southeast of the centre of the House. Probably designed by Vincenzo Valdrè and dated 1805, they flank the southern entrance to the Grand Avenue. The Grand Avenue. The Grand Avenue, from Buckingham to the south and the Oxford Avenue from the south-west, which leads to the forecourt of the house. The Grand Avenue was created in the 1770s; it is 100 ft (30 m) in width and one and half miles in length, and was lined originally with elm trees. The elms succumbed in the 1970s to Dutch elm disease and were replaced with alternate beech & chestnut trees. The Corinthian Arch. Designed in 1765 by Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, Lord Temple\\'s cousin, the arch is built from stone and is 60 ft (18 m) in height and 60 ft (18 m) wide. It is modelled on ancient Roman triumphal arches. This is located at the northern end of the Grand Avenue 0.8 miles south-southeast of the centre of the House and is on the top of a hill. The central arch is flanked on the south side by paired Corinthian pilasters and on the north side by paired Corinthian engaged columns. The arch contains two four-storey residences. The flanking Tuscan columns were added in 1780. The New Inn. Situated about 330 ft (100 m) to the east of the Corinthian Arch, the inn was built in 1717 specifically to provide accommodation for visitors to the gardens. It was expanded and rebuilt in several phases.  The inn housed a small brewery, a farm and dairy. It closed in the 1850s, then being used as a farm, smithy and kennels for deer hounds.The building was purchased in a ruinous condition by the National Trust in 2005. In 2010 work started on converting it into the new visitor centre, and since 2011 this has been the entrance for visitors to the gardens. Visitors had formerly used the Oxford Gates. The New Inn is linked by the Bell Gate Drive to the Bell Gate next to the eastern Lake Pavilion, so called because visitors used to have to ring the bell by the gate to gain admittance to the property. Ha-ha. The main gardens, enclosed within the ha-has (sunken or trenched fences) over four miles (6 km) in length, cover over 400 acres (160 ha). Gallery of features when approaching Stowe. Octagon lake. One of the first areas of the garden that visitors may encounter is the Octagon Lake and the features associated with it. The lake was originally designed as a formal octagonal pool, with sharp corners, as part of the seventeenth century formal gardens. Over the years, the shape of the pond was softened, gradually harmonising it within Stowe\\'s increasingly naturalistic landscape.Monuments and structures in this area include: The Chatham Urn. This is a copy of the large stone urn known as the Chatham Vase carved in 1780 by John Bacon. It was placed in 1831 on a small island in the Octagon Lake. It is a memorial to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham former Prime Minister, who was a relative of the Temple family. The original was sold in 1848 and is now at Chevening House. Congreve\\'s Monument. Built of stone designed by Kent in 1736, this is a memorial to the playwright William Congreve. It is in the form of a pyramid with an urn carved on one side with Apollo\\'s head, pan pipes and masks of comedy and tragedy; the truncated pyramid supports the sculpture of an ape looking at itself in a mirror, beneath are these inscriptions: The Lake Pavilions. These pavilions have moved location during their history. They were designed by Vanbrugh in 1719, they are on the edge of the ha-ha flanking the central vista through the park to the Corinthian Arch. They were moved further apart in 1764 and their details made neo-classical by the architect Borra. Raised on a low podium they are reached by a flight of eight steps, they are pedimented of four fluted Doric columns in width by two in depth, with a solid back wall and with coffered plaster ceiling. Behind the eastern pavilion is the Bell Gate. This was used by the public when visiting the gardens in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Artificial Ruins & The Cascade. Constructed in the 1730s the cascade links the Eleven Acre Lake which is higher with the Octagon Lake. The ruins are a series of arches above the cascade purposefully built to look ruinous. The Wooden Bridge. This crosses the mouth of the River Styx where it emptied into the Octagon Lake. Rebuilt in 2012 by the National Trust in oak, it recreates a long lost bridge. The Pebble Alcove. Built of stone before 1739 probably to the designs of Kent. It takes the form of an exedra enclosed by a stone work surmounted by a pediment. The exedra is decorated with coloured pebbles, including the family coat of arms below which is the Temple family motto TEMPLA QUAM DELECTA (How Beautiful are thy Temples). Gallery of features near the Octagon Lake. South vista. The south vista includes the tree-flanked sloping lawns to the south of the House down to the Octagon Lake and a mile and a half beyond to the Corinthian Arch beyond which stretches the Grand Avenue of over a mile and a half to Buckingham. This is the oldest area of the gardens. There were walled gardens on the site of the south lawn from the 1670s that belonged to the old house. These gardens were altered in the 1680s when the house was rebuilt on the present site. They were again remodelled by Bridgeman from 1716. The lawns with the flanking woods took on their current character from 1741 when \\'Capability\\' Brown re-landscaped this area.The buildings in this area are: The Doric Arch. Built of stone erected in 1768 for the visit of Princess Amelia, probably to the design of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, is a simple arch flanked by fluted Doric pilasters, with an elaborate entablature with triglyphs and carved metopes supporting a tall attic. This leads to the Elysian fields. Apollo and the Nine Muses. Arranged in a semicircle near the Doric Arch there used to be statues of Apollo and the Nine Muses removed sometime after 1790. These sculptures were created by John Nost and were originally positioned along the south vista. In 2019 the ten plinths 5 each side of the Doric Arch were recreated, and statues of the Nine Muses placed on them. Statue of George II. On the western edge of the lawn, the statue was rebuilt in 2004 by the National Trust. This is a monument to King George II, originally built in 1724 before he became king. The monument consists of an unfluted Corinthian column on a plinth over 30 ft (9.1 m) high that supports the Portland stone sculpture of the King which is a copy of the statue sold in 1921. The pillar has this inscription from Horace\\'s Ode 15, Book IV: The Elysian fields. The Elysian Fields is an area to the immediate east of the South Vista; designed by William Kent, work started on this area of the gardens in 1734. The area covers about 40 acres (16 ha). It consists of a series of buildings and monuments surrounding two narrow lakes, called the River Styx, which step down to a branch of the Octagon Lake. The banks are planted with deciduous and evergreen trees. The adoption of the name alludes to Elysium, and the monuments in this area are to the \\'virtuous dead\\' of both Britain and ancient Greece.The buildings in this area are: Saint Mary\\'s Church. In the woods between the House and the Elysian Fields is Stowe parish church. This is the only surviving structure from the old village of Stowe. Dating from the 14th century, the building consists of a nave with aisles and a west tower, a chancel with a chapel to the north and an east window c. 1300 with reticulated tracery.Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown was married in the church in 1744. The church contains a fine Laurence Whistler etched glass window in memory of The Hon. Mrs. Thomas Close-Smith of Boycott Manor, eldest daughter of the 11th Lady Kinloss, who was the eldest daughter of the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. Thomas Close-Smith himself was the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1942, and died in 1946. Caroline Mary, his wife, known as May, died in 1972. The Temple of Ancient Virtue. Built in 1737 to the designs of Kent, in the form of a Tholos, a circular domed building surrounded by columns. In this case they are unfluted Ionic columns, 16 in number, raised on a podium. There are twelve steps up to the two arched doorless entrances. Above the entrances are the words Priscae virtuti (to Ancient Virtue).  Within are four niches one between the two doorways. They contain four life size sculptures (plaster copies of the originals by Peter Scheemakers paid for in 1737, they were sold in 1921). They are Epaminondas (general), Lycurgus (lawmaker), Homer (poet) and Socrates (philosopher). The Temple of British Worthies. Designed by Kent and built 1734–1735. Built of stone, it is a curving roofless exedra with a large stone pier in the centre surmounted by a stepped pyramid containing an oval niche that contains a bust of Mercury, a copy of the original. The curving wall contains six niches either side of the central pier, with further niches on the two ends of the wall and two more behind. At the back of the Temple is a chamber with an arched entrance, dedicated to Signor Fido, a greyhound.The niches are filled by busts, half of which were carved by John Michael Rysbrack for a previous building in the gardens. They portray John Milton, William Shakespeare, John Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Francis Bacon, Elizabeth I, William III and Inigo Jones. The other eight are by Peter Scheemakers, which were commissioned especially for the Temple. These represent Alexander Pope, Sir Thomas Gresham, King Alfred the Great, The Black Prince, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Drake, John Hampden and Sir John Barnard (Whig MP and opponent of the Whig Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole).. The choice of who was considered a \\'British Worthy\\' was very much influenced by the Whig politics of the family, the chosen individuals falling into two groups, eight known for their actions and eight known for their thoughts and ideas. The only woman to be included was Elizabeth I. The inscription above her bust, which praises her leadership, reads: Who confounded the Projects, and destroyed the Power, that threatened to oppress the Liberties of Europe... and, by a wise, a moderate, and a popular Government, gave Wealth, Security, and Respect to England The Shell Bridge. Designed by Kent, and finished by 1739, is actually a dam disguised as a bridge of five arches and is decorated with shells. The Grotto. Probably designed by Kent in the 1730s, is located at the head of the serpentine \\'river Styx\\' that flows through the Elysian Fields. There are two pavilions, one ornamented with shells the other with pebbles and flints. In the central room is a circular recess in which are two basins of white marble. In the upper is a marble statue of Venus rising from her bath, and water falls from the upper into the lower basin, there passing under the floor to the front, where it falls into the river Styx. A tablet of marble is inscribed with these lines from Milton: The Seasons Fountain. Probably erected in 1805, built from white statuary marble. Spring water flows from it, and the basic structure appears to be made from an 18th-century chimneypiece. It used to be decorated with Wedgwood plaques of the four seasons and had silver drinking cups suspended on either side. it was the first structure to be reconstructed under National Trust ownership. The Grenville Column. Originally erected in 1749 near the Grecian Valley, it was moved to its present location in 1756; Earl Temple probably designed it. It commemorates one of Lord Cobham\\'s nephews, Captain Thomas Grenville RN. He was killed in 1747 while fighting the French off Cape Finisterre aboard HMS Defiance under the command of Admiral Anson.The monument is based on an Ancient Roman naval monument, a rostral column, one that is carved with the prows of Roman galleys sticking out from the shaft. The order used is Tuscan, and is surmounted by a statue of Calliope holding a scroll inscribed Non nisi grandia canto (Only sing of heroic deeds); there is a lengthy inscription in Latin added to the base of the column after it was moved. The Cook Monument. Built in 1778 as a monument to Captain James Cook; it takes the form of a stone globe on a pedestal. It was moved to its present position in 1842. The pedestal has a carved relief of Cook\\'s head in profile and the inscription Jacobo Cook/MDCCLXXVIII. The Gothic Cross. Erected in 1814 from Coade stone on the path linking the Doric Arch to the Temple of Ancient Virtue. It was erected by the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos as a memorial to his mother Lady Mary Nugent. It was demolished in the 1980s by a falling elm tree. The National Trust rebuilt the cross in 2016 using several of the surviving pieces of the monument. The Marquess of Buckingham\\'s Urn. Sited behind the Temple of British Worthies, erected in 1814 by the 1st Duke in memory of his father, the urn was moved to the school precincts in 1931. A replica urn was created and erected in 2018. Gallery of features around the Elysian fields. Hawkwell Field. Hawkwell Field lies to the east of the Elysian Fields, and is also known as The Eastern Garden. This area of the gardens was developed in the 1730s & 1740s, an open area surrounded by some of the larger buildings all designed by James Gibbs.The buildings in this area are: The Queen\\'s Temple. Originally designed by Gibbs in 1742 and was then called the Lady\\'s Temple. This was designed for Lady Cobham to entertain her friends. But the building was extensively remodelled in 1772–1774 to give it a neo-classical form.Further alterations were made in 1790 by Vincenzo Valdrè. These commemorated the recovery of  George III from madness with the help of Queen Charlotte after whom the building was renamed.The main floor is raised up on a podium, the main façade consists of a portico of four fluted Composite columns, these are approached by a balustraded flight of steps the width of the portico. The facade is wider than the portico, the flanking walls having niches containing ornamental urns. The large door is fully glazed.The room within is the most elaborately decorated of any of the garden\\'s buildings. The Scagliola Corinthian columns and pilasters are based on the Temple of Venus and Roma, the barrel-vaulted ceiling is coffered. There are several plaster medallions around the walls, including: Britannia Deject, with this inscription Desideriis icta fidelibus Quaerit Patria Caesarem (For Caesar\\'s life, with anxious hopes and fears Britannia lifts to Heaven a nation\\'s tears); Britannia with a palm branch sacrificing to Aesculapius with this inscription O Sol pulcher! O laudande, Canam recepto Caesare felix (Oh happy days! with rapture Britons sing the day when Heavenrestore their favourite King!); Britannia supporting a medallion of the Queen with the inscription Charlottae Sophiae Augustae, Pietate erga Regem, erga Rempublicam Virtute et constantia, In difficillimis temporibus spectatissimae D.D.D. Georgius M. de Buckingham MDCCLXXXIX. (To the Queen, Most respectable in the most difficult moments, for her attachment and zeal for the public service, George Marquess of Buckingham dedicates this monument).Other plaster decoration on the walls includes: 1. Trophies of Religion, Justice and Mercy, 2. Agriculture and Manufacture, 3. Navigation and Commerce and 4. War. Almost all the decoration was the work of Charles Peart except for the statue of Britannia by Joseph Ceracchi.. In 1842 the 2nd Duke of Buckingham inserted in the centre of the floor the Roman mosaic found at nearby Foscott. The Temple has been used for over 40 years by the school as its Music School. The Gothic Temple. Designed by James Gibbs in 1741 and completed about 1748, this is the only building in the gardens built from ironstone, all the others use a creamy-yellow limestone. The building is triangular in plan of two storeys with a pentagonal shaped tower at each corner, one of which rises two floors higher than the main building, while the other two towers have lanterns on their roofs. Above the door is a quote from Pierre Corneille\\'s play Horace: Je rends grace aux Dieux de n\\'estre pas Roman (I thank the gods I am not a Roman).The interior includes a circular room of two storeys covered by a shallow dome that is painted to mimic mosaic work including shields representing the Heptarchy. Dedicated \\'To the Liberty of our Ancestors\\'. To quote John Martin Robinson: \\'to the Whigs, Saxon and Gothic were interchangeably associated with freedom and ancient English liberties: trial by jury (erroneously thought to have been founded by King Alfred at a moot on Salisbury Plain), Magna Carta, parliamentary representation, all the things which the Civil War and Glorious Revolution had protected from the wiles of Stuart would-be absolutism, and to the preservation of which Lord Cobham and his \\'Patriots\\' were seriously devoted.The Temple was used in the 1930s by the school as the Officer Training Corps armoury. It is now available as a holiday let through the Landmark Trust. The Temple of Friendship. Built of stone in 1739 to the designs of Gibbs. It is located in the south-east corner of the garden. Inscribed on the exterior of the building is AMICITIAE S (sacred to friendship). It was badly damaged by fire in 1840 and remains a ruin.Built as a pavilion to entertain Lord Cobham\\'s friends it was originally decorated with murals by Francesco Sleter including on the ceiling Britannia, the walls having allegorical paintings symbolising friendship, justice and liberty. There was a series of ten white marble busts on black marble pedestals around the walls of Cobham (this bust with that of Lord Westmoreland is now in the V&A Museum) and his friends: Frederick, Prince of Wales; Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield; George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton; Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland; William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham; Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst; Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple; Alexander Hume-Campbell, 2nd Earl of Marchmont; John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower. Dated 1741, three were carved by Peter Scheemakers: Cobham, Prince Frederick & Lord Chesterfield, the rest were carved by Thomas Adye. All the busts were sold in 1848.The building consisted of a square room rising through two floors surmounted by a pyramidal roof with a lantern. The front has a portico of four Tuscan columns supporting a pediment, the sides have arcades of one arch deep by three wide also supporting pediments. The arcades and portico with the wall behind are still standing. The Palladian Bridge. This is a copy of the bridge at Wilton House in Wiltshire, which was itself based in a design by Andrea Palladio. The main difference from the Wilton version, which is a footbridge, is that the Stowe version is designed to be used by horse-drawn carriages so is set lower with shallow ramps instead of steps on the approach. It was completed in 1738 probably under the direction of Gibbs. Of five arches, the central wide and segmental with carved keystone, the two flanking semi-circular also with carved keystones, the two outer segmental. There is a balustraded parapet, the middle three arches also supporting an open pavilion. Above the central arch this consists of colonnades of four full and two half columns of unfluted Roman Ionic order. Above the flanking arches there are pavilions with arches on all four sides. These have engaged columns on their flanks and ends of the same order as the colonnade which in turn support pediments. The roof is of slate, with an elaborate plaster ceiling. It originally crossed a stream that emptied from the Octagon Lake, and when the lake was enlarged and deepened, made more natural in shape in 1752, this part of the stream became a branch of the lake. The Saxon Deities. These are sculptures by John Michael Rysbrack of the seven deities that gave their names to the days of the week. Carved from Portland stone in 1727. They were moved to their present location in 1773. (The sculptures are copies of the originals that were sold in 1921–1922). For those, like the Grenville family, who followed Whig politics, the terms \\'Saxon\\' and \\'Gothic\\' represented supposedly English liberties, such as trial by jury.The sculptures are arranged in a circle. Each sculpture (with the exception of Sunna a half length sculpture) is life size, the base of each statue has a Runic inscription of the god\\'s name, and stands on a plinth. They are: Sunna (Sunday), Mona (Monday), Tiw (Tuesday), Woden (Wednesday), Thuner (Thursday), Friga (Friday) and a Saxon version of Seatern (Saturday).The original Sunna & Thuner statues are in the V&A Museum, the original Friga stood for many years in Portmeirion but was sold at auction in 1994 for £54,000, the original Mona is in the Buckinghamshire County Museum. Gallery of features in the Hawkwell Field. The Grecian valley. Is to the north of the Eastern Garden. Designed by Capability Brown and created from 1747 to 1749, this is Brown\\'s first known landscape design. An L-shaped area of lawns covering about 60 acres (24 ha), was formed by excavating 23,500 cu yd (18,000 m3) of earth by hand and removed in wheelbarrows with the original intention of creating a lake. Mature Lime and Elm trees were transplanted from elsewhere on the estate to create a mature landscape. Other tree species that Brown used in this and other areas of the gardens include: cedar, yew, beech, sycamore, larch & Scots pine. As of 2020 there was large London plane tree in the Grecian Valley, that was potentially planted by Capability Brown.The buildings in this area are: Temple of Concord and Victory. The designer of this, the largest of the garden buildings, is unknown, although both Earl Temple and Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford have been suggested as the architect. It is a highly significant, since it is the first building in England whose design intentionally imitate Greek architecture; it was originally known as the \\'Grecian Temple\\'. Earl Temple was a member of the Society of Dilettanti, a group made up of members of the aristocracy who pursued the study of art and architecture.Built from stone, between 1747 and 1749, the building is located where the two legs of the valley meet. It is raised on a podium with a flight of steps up to the main entrance, the cella and pronaos is surrounded by a peristyle of 28 fluted Roman Ionic columns, ten on the flanks and six at each end. The main pediment contains a sculpture by Peter Scheemakers of Four-Quarters of the World bringing their Various Products to Britannia. There are six statues acroterion of cast lead painted to resemble stone on both the east and west pediments. In the frieze of the entablature are the words CONCORDIAE ET VICTORIAE.The sculpture on the building dates from the 1760s when it was converted into a monument to the British victory in the Seven Years\\' War. The ceiling of the peristyle is based on an engraving by Robert Wood of a ceiling in Palmyra. Within the pronaos and cella are 16 terracotta medallions commemorating British Victories in the Seven Years\\' War, these were designed by James \"Athenian\" Stuart, each one is inscribed with the name of the battle: Quebec; Martinico & c.; Louisbourg; Guadeloupe & c.; Montreal; Pondicherry & c.; the naval battle of Belleisle; the naval Battle of Lagos; Crevelt & Minden; Fellinghausen; Goree and Senegal; Crown Point, Niagara and Quesne; Havannah and Manila; Beau Sejour, Cherburgh and Belleisle.The wooden doors are painted a Prussian blue with gilded highlights on the mouldings. Above the door is an inscription by Valerius Maximus: The interior end wall of the cella has an aedicule containing a statue of Liberty. Above is this inscription: The six statues from the roof were sold in 1921. When the school built its chapel in the late 1920s, 16 of the 28 columns from this Temple were moved to the new building, being replaced with plain brickwork. From 1994 to 1996 the National Trust undertook restoration works to create replacement columns with which to restore the Temple. The Fane of Pastoral Poetry. Located in a grove of trees at the eastern end of the Grecian Valley, at the north-east corner of the gardens, the structure is a small belvedere designed by James Gibbs in 1729. It was moved to its present position in the 1760s; it originally stood where Queen Caroline\\'s statue stands. It is square in plan with chamfered corners that, built of stone, each side is an open arch, herma protrude from each chamfered corner. It is surmounted by an octagonal lead dome. The Circle of the Dancing Faun. Located near the north-east end of the valley near the Fane of Pastoral Poetry, the Dancing Faun commanded the centre of a circle of five sculptures of shepherds and shepherdesses, all of the sculptures had been sold. Two of these statues were located in Buckingham and restored in 2009 to their original place in the garden. In 2016 the Faun supported by the so-called Saxon Altar and the other three statues were recreated. The Cobham Monument. To the south of the Grecian Valley is the tallest structure in the gardens rising 115 ft. Built 1747–49 of stone, probably designed by Brown, who adapted a design by Gibbs. It consists of a square plinth with corner buttresses surmounted by Coade stone lions holding shields added in 1778. The column itself is octagonal with a single flute on each face, with a molded doric capital and base. On which is a small belvedere of eight arches with a dome supporting the sculpture of Lord Cobham, the probable sculptor of which was Peter Scheemakers.The present statue is a recreation made in 2001 after the original was struck by lightning in 1957. A spiral staircase rises through the column to the belvedere providing an elevated view of the gardens. Lord Cobham\\'s Walk is a tree-lined avenue that stretches from the Pillar north-east to the edge of the gardens. Statues surrounding the Grecian Valley. The National Trust is creating copies of the statues that used to be found around the edge of the Grecian Valley, and is adding them as and when funds can be raised to cover the cost. The sculptures included Samson and the Philistine recreated in 2015, and several of the twelve Labours of Hercules – so far only Hercules and Antaeus has been recreated (in 2016), and a statue of a gladiator in 2017.In 2018 a replacement of the statue of Thalia holding a scroll with the words Pastorum Carmina Canto on it was erected near the Fane of Pastoral Poetry; the statue is based on a work by John Nost. In 2019 a copy of the Grecian Urn sold in 1921 and now at Trent Park in north London has been erected near the Circle of the Dancing Faun. Gallery of features in the Grecian valley. Western gardens. To the immediate west of the South Vista are the Western Gardens, which include the Eleven-Acre Lake. This area of the gardens was developed from 1712 to 1770s when it underwent its final landscaping. The Eleven-acre lake was extended and given a natural shape in 1762. In the woods to the north-west in 2017 the National Trust recreated the lost sculpture of the Wrestlers. In 2018 the paths surrounding the sculpture were recreated and the Labyrinth around them replanted with 3,500 shrubs including magnolia, laurel, box, yew, spindle and hazel. Within the labyrinth are an outdoor skittle alley and a rustic swing.Also in this area in the woods to the north of the lake but on the east side is the Sleeping Wood designed by Bridgeman, at the heart of which use to stand the Sleeping Parlour being built in 1725 to a design by Vanbrugh, this was inspired by Charles Perrault\\'s tale of Sleeping Beauty.. Pegg\\'s Terrace is a raised avenue of trees that follows the line of the south ha-ha between the Lake Pavilions and the Temple of Venus. Warden Hill Walk, also a raised avenue of trees, is on the western edge of the gardens, the southern part of which serves as a dam for the Eleven Acre Lake, links The Temple of Venus to the Boycott Pavilions.The buildings in this area are: The Rotondo. Designed by Vanbrugh and built 1720–1721, this is a circular temple, consisting of ten unfluted Roman Ionic columns raised up on a podium of three steps. The dome was altered by Borra in 1773–1774 to give it a lower profile. In the centre is a statue of Venus raised on a tall decorated plinth, which is replacement for the original and is gilt. The building was modelled on the temple of Venus at Knidos. Statue of Queen Caroline. This takes the form of a Tetrapylon, a high square plinth surmounted by four fluted Roman Ionic columns supporting an entablature which in turn supports the statue of Queen Caroline. On its pedestal is inscribed Honori, Laudi, Virtuti Divae Carolinae (To honour, Praise and Virtue of the Divine Caroline). According to the authors of National Trust\\'s 1997 guidebook, it was probably designed by Vanbrugh. It stands on the mound left by a former ice house. The Temple of Venus. Dated 1731 this was the first building in the gardens designed by William Kent. Located in the south-west corner of the gardens on the far side of the Eleven-Acre Lake. The stone building takes the form of one of Palladio\\'s villas, the central rectangular room linked by two quadrant arcades to pavilions. According to Michael Bevington, it was an early example of architecture being inspired by that of Roman baths.The main pedimented facade has an exedra screened by two full and two half Roman Ionic columns, there are two niches containing busts either side of the door of Cleopatra & Faustina, the exedra is flanked by two niches containing busts of Nero and Vespasian all people known for their sexual appetites. The end pavilions have domes. Above the door is carved VENERI HORTENSI \"to Venus of the garden\".The interior according to the 1756 Seeley Guidebook was decorated with murals painted by Francesco Sleter the centre of the ceiling had a painting of a naked Venus and the smaller Compartments were painted with a \"variety of intrigues\". The walls had paintings with scenes from Spenser\\'s The Faerie Queene. The paintings were destroyed in the late 18th century.The ceiling frieze had this inscription from the Pervigilium Veneris: The Hermitage. Designed c.1731 by Kent, heavily rusticated and with a pediment containing a carving of panpipes within a wreath, and a small tower to the right of the entrance. It never housed a hermit. Dido\\'s Cave. Little more than an alcove, probably built in the 1720s, originally decorated with a painting of Dido and Aeneas. In c.1781 the dressed stone facade was replaced with tufa by the Marchioness of Buckingham. Her son the 1st Duke of Buckingham turned it into her memorial by adding the inscription Mater Amata, Vale! (Farewell beloved Mother). The designer is unknown. The Boycott Pavilions. Built of stone and designed by James Gibbs, the eastern one was built in 1728 and the western in 1729. They are named after the nearby vanished hamlet of Boycott. Located on the brow of a hill overlooking the river Dad, they flank the Oxford drive. Originally both were in the form of square planned open belvederes with stone pyramidal roofs. In 1758 the architect Giovanni Battista Borra altered them, replacing them with the lead domes, with a round dormer window in each face and an open roof lantern in the centre. The eastern pavilion was converted into a three-storey house in 1952. Gallery of features in the Western Gardens. The Lamport Gardens. Lying to the east of the Eastern Gardens, this was the last and smallest area just 17 acres (6.9 ha) added to the gardens. Named after the vanished hamlet of Lamport, the gardens were created from 1826 by Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and his gardener James Brown. From 1840, 2nd Duke of Buckingham\\'s gardener, Mr Ferguson, and the architect Edward Blore, adapted it as an ornamental rock and water garden. Originally the garden was stocked with exotic birds including emus.The buildings in this area are: The Chinese House. The Chinese House is known to date from 1738 making it the first known building in England built in the Chinese style. It is made of wood and painted on canvas inside and out by Francesco Sleter. Originally it was on stilts in a pond near the Elysian Fields. In 1751 it was moved from Stowe and reconstructed first at Wotton House, the nearby seat of the Grenville family. In 1951 it then moved to Harristown, Kildare. Its construction set a new fashion in landscape gardening for Chinese-inspired structures.It was purchased by the National Trust in 1996 and returned and placed in its present position. The Chinoiserie Garden Pavilion at Hamilton Gardens in New Zealand is based on Stowe\\'s Chinese House. Parkland. Surrounding the gardens, the park originally covered over 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) and stretched north into the adjoining county of Northamptonshire. In what used to be the extreme north-east corner of the park, about 2.5 mi (4.0 km) from the house over the county border lies Silverstone Circuit. This corner of the park used to be heavily wooded, known as Stowe Woods, with a series of avenues cut through the trees, over a mile of one of these avenues (or riding) still survives terminated in the north by the racing circuit and aligned to the south on the Wolfe Obelisk though there is a gap of over half-mile between the two. It is here that one can find the remains of the gardener\\'s treehouse, an innovative design comprising wood and textiles.There is a cascade of 25 ft (7.6 m) high leading out of the Eleven Acre Lake by a tunnel under the Warden Hill Walk on the western edge of the garden, into the Copper Bottom Lake that was created in the 1830s just to the south-west of the gardens. The lake was originally lined with copper to waterproof the porous chalk into which the lake was dug.The house\\'s kitchen garden, extensively rebuilt by the 2nd Duke, was located at Dadford about 2/3 of mile north of the house. Only a few remains of the three walled gardens now exist, but originally they were divided into four and centred around fountains. There is evidence of the heating system: cast iron pipes used to heat greenhouses, which protected the fruit and vegetables, including then-exotic fruits.Stowe School had given the National Trust a protective covenant over the gardens in 1967, but the first part they actually acquired was the 28 acres (11 ha) of the Oxford Avenue in 1985, purchased from the great-great-grandson of the 3rd Duke, Robert Richard Grenville Close-Smith, a local landowner. The National Trust has pursued a policy of acquiring more of the original estate, only a fraction of which was owned by the school, in 1989 the school donated 560 acres (230 ha) including the gardens. In 1992 some 58 acres (23 ha) of Stowe Castle Farm to the east of the gardens was purchased, and in 1994 part of New Inn Farm to the south of the gardens was bought. Then 320 acres (130 ha) of Home Farm to the north and most of the 360-acre (150 ha) fallow deer-park to the south-west of the gardens were acquired in 1995, this was restored in 2003 there are now around 500 deer in the park.In 2005 a further 9.5 acres (3.8 ha) of New Inn Farm including the Inn itself were acquired. The trust now owns 750 acres (300 ha) of the original park. In the mid-1990s the National Trust replanted the double avenue of trees that surrounded the ha-ha to the south and south-west including the two bastions that project into the park on which sit the temples of Friendship at the south-east corner and Venus at the south-west corner, connecting with Oxford Avenue by the Boycott Pavilions, the Oxford Avenue then continues to the north-east following the ha-ha and ends level with the Fane of Pastoral Poetry at the north-east corner of the gardens.The buildings in the park include: The Lamport Lodge. This, uniquely for the gardens, red brick lodge, in a Tudor Gothic style, with two bay windows either side of porch and is a remodelling of 1840–1841 by Blore of an earlier building. It acts as an entrance through the ha-ha. There are three sets of iron gates, that consists of one carriage and two flanking pedestrian entrances. They lead to an avenue of Beech trees planted in 1941 that lead to the Gothic Temple. Oxford Avenue. The Grand Avenue by the Corinthian Arch turns to the west to join the Queen\\'s Drive that connects to the Oxford Avenue just below the Boycott Pavilions. The Oxford Avenue was planted in the 1790s, and sold to the National Trust in 1985 by the great-great-grandson of the 3rd Duke, Robert Richard Grenville Close-Smith (1936–1992), a local landowner. Close-Smith was the grandson of the Honourable Mrs. Caroline Mary Close-Smith, who was the 11th Lady Kinloss\\'s daughter. This was one of the first acquisitions of the trust at Stowe. Water Stratford Lodge. Water Stratford Lodge is located over a mile from the house near the border with Oxfordshire, at the very start of the Oxford Avenue, by the village of the same name. Built in 1843, the single storey lodge is in Italianate style with a porch flanked by two windows, the dressings are of stone, with rendered walls. The architect was Edward Blore. The Oxford Gates. The central piers were designed by William Kent in 1731, for a position to the north-east between the two Boycott Pavilions, they were moved to their present location in 1761, and iron railings added either side. Pavilions at either end were added in the 1780s to the design of the architect Vincenzo Valdrè. The piers have coats of arms in Coade stone manufactured by Eleanor Coade. The Oxford Bridge. The bridge was built in 1761 to cross the river Dad after this had been dammed to form what was renamed the Oxford Water; it was probably designed by Earl Temple. It is built of stone and is of hump-backed form, with three arches, the central one being slightly wider and higher than the flanking ones. With a solid parapet, there are eight decorative urns placed at the ends of the parapets and above the two piers. Features close to Oxford Avenue. Wider estate buildings. Buildings on the wider estate, both on current and former land-holdings, include: Stowe Castle (Not owned by the National Trust) is two miles (3 km) to the east of the gardens, built in the 1730s probably to designs by Gibbs. The tall curtain wall visible from the gardens actually disguises several farmworkers\\' cottages.The Bourbon Tower, approximately one thousand feet to the east of the Lamport Garden, was built c1741 probably to designs by Gibbs, it is a circular tower of three floors with a conical roof, it was given its present name in 1808 to commemorate a visit by the exiled French royal family.. The 2nd Duke\\'s Obelisk near the Bourbon Tower, this granite obelisk was erected in 1864.. The Wolfe Obelisk stone 100 ft (30 m) high located about 2,000 ft (610 m) to the north-west of the garden, originally designed by Vanbrugh, it was moved in 1754 from the centre of the Octagon Lake and is a memorial to General Wolfe.. The Gothic Umbrello, also called the Conduit House, it houses beneath its floor a conduit. about a 1,000 ft (300 m) south of the Wolfe Obelisk, is a small octagonal pavilion dating from the 1790s. The coat of arms of the Marquess of Buckingham, dated 1793, made from Coade stone are place over the entrance door.. Silverstone Lodges (Not owned by the National Trust), built by the 1st Duke, these twin lodges used to flank the northern entrance to the park, and used to lead to the private carriage drive from Silverstone to the house. The drive no longer exists, this having long since been destroyed, part of it passed through what is now the racing circuit. North front. The North Front of Stowe School is closed to visitors. In front of the north facade of the house, the forecourt has in its centre an: Equestrian statue of George I. This is a greater than life size equestrian statue of King George I by Andries Carpentière, located in the middle of the Forecourt, made of cast lead in 1723. It is on a tall stone plinth. It was this monarch that gave Lord Cobham his title of viscount in 1718 and restored his military command, leading to his involvement in the Capture of Vigo. The Menagerie. Hidden in the woods to the west of the South Vista. It was built by the Marquess of Buckingham for his wife as a retreat. It was built in stone, c.1781, probably to the designs of Valdrè. The 1st Duke converted it to a museum where he displayed his collections, which included a 32 ft (9.8 m) long Boa constrictor - at the time the largest in England. The building is in private use by Stowe School. Demolished buildings and monuments. As the design of the gardens evolved many changes were made. This resulted in the demolition of many monuments. The following is a list by area of such monuments. The ApproachesThe Chackmore Fountain built c.1831, situated halfway down the Grand Avenue near the hamlet of Chackmore, dismantled in the 1950s.

They include: Early tourism. The New Inn public house was constructed in 1717, and provided lodging and food for visitors who had come to admire the gardens and the park, with its neo-classical sculptures and buildings. During the eighteenth century, visitors arrived at the Bell Gate.Stowe was the subject of some of the earliest tourist guide books published in Britain, written to guide visitors around the site. The first was published in 1744 by Benton Seeley, founder of Seeley, Service, who produced A Description of the Gardens of Lord Cobham at Stow Buckinghamshire. The final edition of this series was published in 1838.In 1748 William Gilpin produced Views of the Temples and other Ornamental Buildings in the Gardens at Stow, followed in 1749 by A Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stow. In Gilpin\\'s Dialogue two mythical figures, Callophilus and Polypthon, prefer different styles of gardening at Stowe to each other: Callophilus prefers formality; Polypthon, the romantic and ruinous.Copies of all three books were published in 1750 by George Bickham as The Beauties of Stow.To cater to the large number of visitors from France, an anonymous French guidebook, Les Charmes de Stow, was published in 1748. In the 1750s Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote about the gardens, which spread their notoriety throughout Europe. He had this to say: Stowe is composed of very beautiful and very picturesque spots chosen to represent different kinds of scenery, all of which seem natural except when considered as a whole, as in the Chinese gardens of which I was telling you. The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human.. Another francophone guide was published by Georges-Louis Le Rouge in 1777. Détails de nouveaux jardins à la mode included engravings of buildings at Stowe as well as at other famous gardens in Britain. In Germany, Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld published Theorie der Gartenkunst in 5 volumes in Leipzig 1779–1785, which included Stowe. Cultural significance. The World Monuments Fund describes Stowe as \"one of the most beautiful and complex historic landscapes in Britain\". The range and stature of the designers deployed, including Bridgeman, Brown, Vanbrugh, Gibbs and Kent; the intricacy of the architectural and allegorical schemes those designers devised; the unified conception they created; the extent of its survival; and its influence as the \"birthplace of the English art of landscape gardening\", combine to make Stowe \"a  garden of international repute\". Its importance is recognised in the large number of listed structures within the garden and the wider park, and its own Grade I listing designation. Architecture and horticulture. The Temples’ wealth and prestige enabled them to engage most of the leading designers of the Georgian period. The outline of the present gardens was laid by Charles Bridgeman, and some of the earliest of the forty monuments and temples situated on the estate were designed by John Vanbrugh. They were followed by William Kent, James Gibbs and then by a youthful Capability Brown, who was appointed head gardener at Stowe at the age of 25, and later married in the estate church. Tim Knox, in his chapter \"The Fame of Stowe\", published in the Trust\\'s book, Stowe Landscape Gardens, suggests that Brown\\'s subsequent career, which saw him deploy the expertise gained at Stowe across a large number of other landscape parks throughout England, may in fact be the garden\\'s most significant legacy. In addition to the major British architects deployed, the Temples engaged a number of prominent Europeans. Although they worked primarily on the house, they also contributed to some of the garden structures. Giovanni Battista Borra worked on the Temple of Concord and Victory and modernised the Boycott Pavilions and the Oxford Gate. Georges-François Blondel may have undertaken work on the Queen\\'s Temple, while Vincenzo Valdrè designed the Oxford Gate lodges, the base of the Cobham Monument and may have been responsible for the Menagerie.The work of so many major architects, some of whom came to make improvements and alterations to the house but also contributed to the design and structure of the garden and park, gives the gardens and park at Stowe a particular architectural flavour. It is less a garden of plants and flowers, and more a landscape of lawns, water and trees, with carefully contrived vistas and views which frequently culminate in eye-catcher structures. Other gardens of the period, such as Claremont, Kew and Stourhead followed this style, but few matched the scale of Stowe. While the buildings in the grounds at Stowe are natural foci for attention, the landscaping around the structures is as vital to the overall scheme. The gardens progressed from a formal, structured layout, through increasing naturalisation. The planting of grasses and trees was equally deliberate, designed to lead the eyes of the visitor on to the next area, and to bring a sense of drama to the landscape.The gardens incorporate a number of architectural and horticultural \"firsts\". They are themselves considered the earliest example of the English landscape garden. Defining the borders of the park he began, Charles Bridgeman designed the first ha-ha in England, a feature that was widely imitated. Within the garden, Kent\\'s Chinese House was perhaps England\\'s earliest Chinoiserie building. So notable were the gardens at Stowe that they were emulated across the world. Thomas Jefferson visited, and bought the guidebooks, transporting ideas across the Atlantic for his Monticello estate. Eastwards, it inspired gardens in Germany such as that at Wörlitz, and those created at Peterhof and Tsarskoye Selo by Catherine the Great. Sermon in stone – the \"meaning\" of the garden. A central element of the uniqueness of Stowe were the efforts of its owners to tell a story within, and through, the landscape. A symposium organised by the Courtauld  Institute, The Garden at War: Deception, Craft and Reason, suggests that it was not \"a garden of flowers or shrubs [but] of ideas.\" The original concept may have been derived from an essay written by Joseph Addison for the Tatler magazine. The landscape was to be a \"sermon in stone\", emphasising the perceived Whig triumphs of Reason, the Enlightenment, liberty and the Glorious Revolution, and \\'British\\' virtues of Protestantism, empire, and curbs on absolutist monarchical power. These were to stand in contrast with the debased values of the corrupt political regime then prevailing. The temples of Ancient Virtues and British Worthies were material expressions of what the Temples themselves supported, while the intentionally ruined Temple of Modern Virtue was a contemptuous depiction of what they opposed, the buildings and their setting making a clear moral and political statement. Praising the \"grandeur of [its] overall conception\", John Julius Norwich considered that the garden at Stowe better expressed the beliefs and values of its creators, the Whig Aristocracy, \"than any other house in England.\"As Stowe evolved from an English baroque garden into a pioneering landscape park, the gardens became an attraction for many of the nobility, including political leaders. Many of the temples and monuments in the garden celebrate the political ideas of the Whig party. They also include quotes by many of the writers who are part of Augustan literature, also philosophers and ideas belonging to the Age of Enlightenment. The Temple family used the construction of the Temple of Ancient Virtue, modelled on the Temple of Sibyl in Tivoli, to assert their place as a family of \\'ancient virtue\\'. Figures depicted in the temple include Homer, Socrates, Epaminondas and Lycurgus, whose attributes are described with Latin inscriptions that promote them as \"defenders of liberty\".Richard Temple was also the leader of a political faction known as Cobham\\'s Cubs, established as opposition to the policies of Robert Walpole. Part of the gardens at Stowe were altered to illustrate this rivalry: Temple erected the Temple of Modern Virtue, purposefully constructed as a ruin and located next to a decaying statue of Walpole. (The Temple of Modern Virtue is no longer extant.). The principles of the English landscape garden were unpopular with Tory supporters who, according to the historian Christopher Christie, did not approve of how they \"displayed in a very conspicuous way\" the estate and parkland. There was also concern, from commentators such as Oliver Goldsmith, that demolishing the homes of tenants was \"unacceptable and an abuse of power\".Contemporary satire reflected the role the gardens played in political life by portraying caricatures of the better-known politicians of history taking their ease in similar settings. In 1762, Lord Kames, a philosopher, commented that for the visitor the political commentary within the garden at Stowe may be \"something they guess\" rather than clearly explained. Art. Charles Bridgeman commissioned 15 engravings of the gardens from Jacques Rigaud (fr), which were published in 1739. The etching was undertaken by another French artist, Bernard Baron. They show views of the gardens with an array of fashionable figures, including the Italian castrato Senesino, disporting themselves in the foreground. One set is held in the Royal Collection. In 1805-9 John Claude Nattes painted 105 wash drawings of both the house and gardens. Stowe is one of the houses and gardens depicted on the frog service, a dinner service for fifty people commissioned from Wedgwood by Catherine the Great for her palace at Tsarskoye Selo. John Piper produced watercolours of some of the monuments in the gardens, including the Temple of British Worthies, amongst others.The gardens at Stowe were as much influenced by art as they provided an inspiration for it. The idealised pastoral landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, with their echoes of an earlier Arcadia, led English aristocrats with the necessary means to attempt to recreate the Roman Campagna on their English estates. Kent\\'s acquaintance, Joseph Spence, considered that his Elysian Fields were \"a picture translated into a garden\". Poetry. Alexander Pope who first stayed at the house in 1724, celebrated the design of Stowe as part of a tribute to Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. The full title of the 1st edition (1731) was An Epistle to the Right Honourable Richard Earl of Burlington, Occasion\\'d by his Publishing Palladio\\'s Designs of the Baths, Arches, Theatres, &c. of Ancient Rome. Lines 65–70 of the poem run: In 1730 James Thomson published his poem Autumn, part of his four works The Seasons. Stowe is referenced in lines 1040–46: In 1732 Lord Cobham\\'s nephew Gilbert West wrote a lengthy poem, The Gardens of the Right Honourable Richard Viscount Cobham, a guide to the gardens in verse form. Another poem which included references to Stowe is The Enthusiast; or lover of nature by Joseph Warton. Historic importance. Stowe has a \"more remarkable collection of garden buildings than any other park in [England]\". Some forty structures remain in the garden and wider park; Elizabeth Williamson considered that the number of extant structures made Stowe unique. Of these, some 27 separate garden buildings are designated Grade I, Historic England\\'s highest grade, denoting buildings of \"exceptional interest\". The remainder are listed at Grade II* or Grade II. The garden and surrounding park are themselves listed at Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In the opening chapter of Stowe House: Saving an Architectural Masterpiece, the most recent study of the house and the estate, Jeremy Musson describes the mansion as \"the centrepiece of a landscape garden of international repute\", while the National Trust, the garden\\'s custodian, suggests that the estate is \"one of the most remarkable legacies of Georgian England\". The architectural historian Christopher Hussey declared the garden at Stowe to be the \"outstanding monument to English Landscape Gardening\". .   Stowe, frog service.

      "{'input': ' Geography and location. Barcelona, capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant, on the Mediterranean coast. Its geographical location is between 41° 16\\' and 41° 30\\' north latitude and between 1° 54\\' and 2° 18\\' east longitude. With a surface area of 102.16 km2, it is located on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Serra de Collserola — with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point — as well as by the deltas of the Besòs and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the Montjuïc mountain (184.8 m).Barcelona is also the capital of the comarca of the Barcelonès and of the province of Barcelona, and is the most important urban center of Catalonia in demographic, political, economic, and cultural terms. It is the headquarters of the autonomous government and the Parliament of Catalonia, as well as the provincial council, the archbishopric, and the IV Military Region, and has a port, an airport and an important network of railroads and roads. With a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015, it is the second most populated city in Spain after Madrid, and the eleventh in the European Union. Administrative divisions. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km2, 100,685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old part of the city — hence the name \"old city\" — derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus La Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the 18th century.. Eixample (7.46 km2, 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Plan de Eixample drawn up by Ildefonso Cerdá.. Sants-Montjuïc (21.35 km2, 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montjuïc mountain, making it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. The old toponym (place name) comes from the church of Santa Maria dels Sants (\"Saint Mary of the Saints\"), and is present in the street and square of Sants, while Montjuïc (\"Jewish mountain\") has a park, a promenade, and a road with that name.. Les Corts (6.08 km2, 81,200 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarrià, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval farmhouse, hence the name (from the Latin cohors, country house). It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-19th century experienced a notable urban increase with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. It is found in the gazetteer in a street, a square and a crossing that bear the name of Les Corts. It includes the area of Pedralbes, formerly belonging to Sarrià; there is a square and an avenue with that name, coming from the monastery of Santa María de Pedralbes, from the Latin word petras albas (\"white stones\").. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km2, 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarrià and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Serra de Collserola. The name Sarrià comes from the Latin Serrianum, probably derived from the patronymic Serrius; it has remained in the homonymous square and avenue, as well as in the streets Mayor and Minor de Sarrià, the Camí Vell de Sarrià and the road from Sarrià to Vallvidrera. For its part, Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (where a cassola is a narrow passage between ravines) is located in the street of Sant Gervasi de Cassolas and Passeig de San Gervasi. It includes what was also the old municipality of Vallvidrera (from the Latin Vallis Vitrariae), incorporated into the town of Sarrià in 1892; this place name includes an avenue, a square, a road and a shortcut with that name, as well as the road from Vallvidrera to Tibidabo and the roads from Vallvidrera to Barcelona, les Planes and Tibidabo.Gràcia (4.19 km2, 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gràcia, incorporated into the city in 1897. It was an agricultural area, which in the early 19th century began to forge an urban and industrial network. It has its origin in the church of Nostra Senyora de Gràcia i Sant Josep, founded in the 17th century. Its name has endured in the street, the promenade and the crossing of Gracia, as well as in the main street of Gràcia and the Plaza de la Villa de Gracia.. Horta-Guinardó (11.96 km2, 166 950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinardó district, formerly belonging to Sant Martí de Provençals, was added administratively. The old municipality appears in the nomenclature on Horta street and the road from Horta to Sardañola. For its part, Guinardó has a street, a square, a roundabout and a park.. Nou Barris (8.04 km2, 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from San Andrés de Palomar. Its name comes from the fact that originally there were \"nine neighborhoods\", although there are currently 13. It entered the street map in 1982 with the street of Nou Barris and in 2001 with the homonymous square, in addition to the Plaza Mayor de Nou Barris in 2008. Its oldest neighborhood is Vilapicina, an ancient village that arose around the sanctuary of Santa Eulalia de Vilapicina, from the tenth century; the term comes from villa and black pine pitch called in Latin pix, whose place of production was a pixina or picina, and is remembered in the street of Vilapicina.. San Andrés (6.56 km2, 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of San Andrés de Palomar, annexed in 1897. It was an agricultural and milling area until the mid-19th century, when many industries began to settle. Its memory is remembered in the stream of San Andrés, the main street of San Andrés and the street of Palomar.. San Martin (10.80 km2, 232 629 inhabitants): it comes from the old village of San Martin de Provensals, added in 1897. It has dedicated the street, the round and the park of San Martin, as well as the street of Provensals. The old municipality was divided into four neighborhoods: Sagrera, Muntanya, Clot and Taulat, all of them remembered with streets.. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors (for the convent of Sant Francesc), Pino (for the church of Santa Maria del Pi), Mar (for the church of Santa Maria del Mar) and San Pedro (for the monastery of San Pere de las Puelles). This division was made by establishing a grid with the Plaça del Blat as the geometric center, with a separation of the north and south quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. In the 15th century another quarter was added, that of El Raval (\"arrabal\"), thus establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was carried out that created five districts, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of La Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mainly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla. Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts. The most notable were those of 1837, in which the city was divided into four districts (Lonja, San Pedro, Universidad and San Pablo); and that of 1878, after the demolition of the walls, in which 10 districts were established: I-La Barceloneta, II-Borne, III-Lonja, IV-Atarazanas, V-Hospital, VI-Audiencia, VII-Instituto, VIII-Universidad, IX-Hostafranchs and X-Concepción.Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the twentieth century, with the aggregation of the bordering municipalities, a new administrative reorganization was carried out, again with 10 districts: I-Barceloneta and Pueblo Nuevo, II-San Pedro, III-Lonja and Audiencia, IV-Concepción, V-Atarazanas and Hospital, VI-Universidad, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gracia and San Gervasio, IX-Horta and San Andrés del Palomar, X-San Martín de Provensals.In 1933 a new reformulation was made, also with ten districts: I-Barceloneta, II-Poble Sec and Montjuïc, III-Sarriá, Vallvidrera and San Gervasio, IV- San Pedro and Derecha del Eixample, V-Raval, VI-Izquierda del Eixample, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gracia, IX-Horta, San Andrés de Palomar, Sagrera and Campo del Arpa, X-San Martín de Provensals, Clot and Poblenou. These districts were expanded in 1949 with two more: XI-Les Corts and XII-Sagrada Familia.In 1984 the current division into ten districts was approved, established with the aim of decentralizing the City Council, transferring competencies to the new consistories. The new districts were established with the maximum respect for their historical and morphological identity, but also seeking a practical and functional delimitation, which would guarantee the neighbors a wide welfare coverage. In general, an effort was made to respect the old demarcations from the old city, its expansion and the aggregated municipalities, although some areas varied with respect to their historical belonging: Pedralbes, previously belonging to Sarriá, became part of Les Corts; Vallcarca, formerly part of Horta, was incorporated into Gracia; El Guinardó, originally from San Martín, was added to Horta; and the new district of Nou Barris was segregated from San Andrés. History. Toponymy. The origin and meaning of the toponym (place name) Barcelona is uncertain. It seems to come from an Iberian settlement called Barkeno, which is mentioned in some Iberian drachmas of the 2nd century BC. This form evolved into the Latin Barcino when the city was founded as a Roman colony in the 1st century B.C. Some legends point to a possible Carthaginian origin, derived from Amilcar Barca, but it seems unlikely, as the legend that attributes the founding of the city to Hercules, who would have landed there in the ninth ship of a fleet, so he would have called it Barca-nona.. The first written mention of Barcino comes from the first century A.D., by Pomponius Mela, while in the second century A.D. the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy mentions it in Greek as Βαρκινών (Barkinṓn) in his Geography. The toponym evolved between the 4th and 7th centuries: in the 4th Avienius calls it in his Ora maritima as Barcilo, although numerous variants appear then, such as Barcilona, Barcinona, Barcinonem, Barchinon or Barchinonam. On the other hand, already in the year 402 the poet Persius calls it Barcellone, a genitive that suggests the existence of the nominative Barcellona. Isidoro of Seville names it in the 7th century as Barcinona, while already in that century the current form Barcelona appears for the first time. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the 1st century BC. C. with the name of Colonia Iulia Augusta Faventia Faventia Paterna Barcino. It was originally a small walled city that initially took the urban form of castrum, and later oppidum, settled on Mount Táber (16.9 masl), a small hill located on the site of the current Plaça Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period was during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. From here, there were two main roads: the cardo maximus, oriented north-south (today\\'s Libretería and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus, oriented east-west (Obispo, Ciudad and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure.The Roman origin of the city is present in several streets, all derived from its full Latin name: Via Julia, from the Julio-Claudian dynasty that ruled the Empire at the time of the founding of the city; Via Augusta, after the Emperor Augustus; Via Favencia, a term derived from the Latin verb faveo (\"to favor\"), apparently because it was a colony exempt from taxes; and Via Barcino, after the Latin name of the city. Middle Ages. After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and the Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon, and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban nucleus — what is today the Gothic Quarter — and in the 14th century, El Raval district emerged. Barcelona then had about 25,000 inhabitants.The medieval streets were short and narrow, without any planimetry and laid out at the whim of the landowners. The first known names were usually toponymic in nature, referring to features of the terrain or some kind of geographical feature: streets such as Arenas, Cantos, Arcos, Arcos de Junqueras, Balsas de Sant Pere or Rec. Many others referred to water wells, such as the streets Pou de la Cadena, Pou de la Figuera, Pou de l\\'Estany and Pou Dolç.. In a following phase, several streets were named with anthroponyms, names or surnames of characters or families, generally landowners. Some examples are Amargós, Avinyó, Bellafila, Bertrellans, Caçador, Copons, Esquirol, Estruc, Ferlandina, Fonollar, Lledó, Marquet, Mònec, Montcada, Montjuïc -from which Montjuïc del Carme and Montjuïc del Bisbe are derived-, Petritxol, Picalquers, Regomir, Requesens, Robador, Serra or Tarròs streets.Numerous streets were also baptized with religious names, either saints (hagiotoponyms) or invocations from convents and monasteries; some examples would be: San Antonio Abad, San Pablo, San Olegario, Santa Madrona, San Agustín, Santa Mónica, San Paciano, Santa Eulalia, San Severo, Bonsuccés, San Honorato, San Miguel, Ave María, Trinidad, San Francisco, Merced, Santa Lucia, Valldonzella, Santa Catalina, Montalegre, San Cucufate, Egipcíacas, San Vicente, Carmen, Pie de la Cruz, Elisabets, Santa Ana, Jerusalén, Magdalenas, San Pedro (Alta, Baja and Mediana), Montsió, etc.. Another large number of streets come from trades and guilds, which used to be grouped by zones. The streets Abaixadors (\"shearers\"), Agullers (\"hole makers\"), Argenteria (\"silversmiths\"), Assaonadors (\"shellers\"), Boters (\"coopers\"), Brocaters (\"brocateros\"), Canvis Vells and Canvis Nous (\"cambistas\"), Carders (\"carders\"), Corders (\"corders\"), Cotoners (\"cotoners\"), Dagueria (\"cutlers\"), Escudellers (\"potters\"), Esparteria (\"esparteria\"), Espaseria (\"sword making\"), Flassaders (\"manteros\"), Freneria (\"frenería\"), Mercaders (\"mercaders\"), Mirallers (\"mirror makers\"), Tallers (\"cutters\"), Tapineria (\"tapineria\"), Traginers (\"muleteers\") and Vidrieria (\"glass makers\").Some streets also used to be named for the presence of singular buildings (Palace, Cathedral) or various establishments (Hospital, New Baths). Tradition has it that the name Carassa Street comes from a carota on the corner between this street and Mirallers Street, which announced a nearby brothel.During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Fernando, Baños Nuevos, Palla, and Obispo. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and it had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, today the parish of San Jaime), baths, schools and hospitals. Its memory lives on in the streets of Call and Arco de San Ramón del Call. Over time, the first settlements outside the city walls began to appear. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa María del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of San Cucufate del Riego, of agrarian character; the neighborhood of San Pedro around San Pedro de las Puellas; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa María del Pino; that of Santa Ana next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Mayor. El Raval neighborhood (\"slum\") was also gradually formed, initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings.The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to expand the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from San Pedro de las Puelles to the Atarazanas, facing the sea. The enclosure had eight new gates, some of which gave their name to various enclaves of the city that still remain: the Portal del Angel, which gave its name to an avenue; the Puertaferrisa, whose name is on a street; or La Boqueria, remembered in a street and a square, as well as a market.In the 13th century, Ancha Street was opened, connecting Santa Maria del Mar with Framenors. It was once the widest street in the city, hence its name, and was the residence of wealthy families who built numerous palaces there. In 1355 an urban reform took place in front of the Bisbal Gate of the wall, whereby several houses were demolished to channel the waters of the Collserola mountain range to the Plaza de San Jaime, giving rise to a square that was called Plaza Nueva.On the other hand, in 1389 the so-called Porxo del Forment (\"porch of wheat\") was located on a beach area left by the former islets of Maians and Puig de les Falzies, which would later become a large square, the Pla de Palau, so called because the Viceroy\\'s palace was located there. The Pla de Palau was the nerve center of Barcelona between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when it was replaced by the Plaça de Catalunya.At the end of the 14th century, the Plaça del Rei was opened, which until then had been a corral and straw and fodder market. Its name comes from being located next to the Palau Reial Major, the residence in Barcelona of the kings of the Crown of Aragon.It is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (San Lázaro road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc.Finally, it is also worth noting a privilege that the city could grant during this period to other localities by which they came to be considered as \"streets\" of Barcelona, and thus came under the institutional protection of the city: the carreratge. In these cases, the jurisdiction of these localities was shared between the city and the monarch: the former maintained the ownership, and the latter the usufruct. Barcelona came to have 74 localities considered as streets, among them: Igualada, Cardedeu, Vilamajor, Llissá de Munt, La Ametlla, San Felíu de Codinas, Mollet del Vallès, Sardañola del Vallés, Granollers, Caldas de Montbui, Montmeló, San Cugat del Vallés, Santa Perpetua de Moguda, Vallvidrera, Martorell, Molins de Rey, Olesa de Montserrat, Mataró, Vilasar de Dalt, Argentona, Premiá de Mar, Villanueva y Geltrú, Moyá, Palamós, San Sadurní de Noya, Ripoll, and Cambrils. Early modern age. In this period Barcelona became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the 16th century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers\\' War and the War of Succession between the 17th and 18th centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry. The city was still confined within its walls - the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta — despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona\\'s capital status led to a decrease in large-scale projects. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Levante, Torre Nueva, San Ramón and Mediodía were placed. The port was also reformed, and the seafront between the Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, which led to the development of the Paseo del Mar, now known as the Paseo de Colón, in honor of Christopher Columbus.Otherwise, the main urban reform in that century was in the area around the cathedral, where the Plaza de Cristo Rey (now the Plaza de la Seo) was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Plaza de San Ivo, with a space cut out of the Royal Palace.. In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates: San Severo, Talleres, San Antonio, San Pablo and Santa Madrona. Two new roads were also built that crossed the plain of Barcelona: the Mataró road — coinciding with the current Pedro IV street — and the Cruz Cubierta road, which connected with the Madrid road -current Hostafrancs and Sants streets-.. In 1753, the construction of La Barceloneta neighborhood began on the initiative of the Marquis de la Mina. Located on a small peninsula of land reclaimed from the sea, its layout was designed by the engineer Pedro Martín Cermeño, with a grid of orthogonal streets and blocks of houses with elongated floor plans, a clear example of academic Baroque urban planning. The name of the neighborhood appears in a square, a promenade, a park, a beach and a pier. The rest of the streets have received different names, preferably related to the sea, such as the street and square of the Sea, or the streets of the Mediterranean, Sailors and Fishermen; also several sailors, admirals and discoverers: Pinzón Brothers, Pizarro, Balboa, Andrea Doria, Admiral Aixada, Admiral Cervera, Admiral Churruca, Admiral Barceló and Berenguer Mallol. Between 1776 and 1778 the urbanization of la Rambla was carried out, an ancient torrent that during the Middle Ages marked the western boundary of the city, which had been populated since the 16th century, mainly by theaters and convents. At this time the inner wall was demolished, the buildings were realigned and a new landscaped promenade was designed, in the style of the French boulevard. La Rambla has different names for each of its sections, so it is also often referred to in the plural, Las Ramblas. From the Plaza de Cataluña to the Portal de la Paz, it is called: Rambla de Canaletas, after the water pipes of the San Severo reservoir; de los Estudios, after the old university or Estudi General; de San José, after the Carmelite convent of San José, located on the present site of the Boquería market; de los Capuchinos, after the convent of the Capuchins of Santa Madrona, which was in the area of the present Plaza Real; and de Santa Mónica, after the church of the same name. The term rambla comes from the Arabic ramla (رملة), which means \"sandbank\" — or intermittent watercourse — and has since been used as a generic for numerous thoroughfares in the city: Badal, Brasil, Cazador, Carmelo, Cataluña, Fabra i Puig, Guipúzcoa, Mar, Once de Septiembre, Pueblo Nuevo, Prat, Prim, Raval and Volart.Around the same time as La Rambla, the promenades of San Juan and Gracia were planned, although they were not built until the turn of the century for the former and 1820-1827 for the latter. The first was named after the apostle John the Evangelist, and the second for being the access road to the town of Gracia — formerly known as the road of Jesus.Between 1778 and 1789, Count del Asalto Street was laid out — currently Nueva de la Rambla Street — which was named after Francisco González de Bassecourt, Captain General of Catalonia, who had the initiative to create the street. He was the first exponent of the dedication of a street to a particular character, thus beginning a custom that has lasted until today.In 1797 the Paseo Nuevo (or Paseo de la Explanada) was also created, located next to the military Citadel, a wide avenue lined with poplars and elms and decorated with ornamental fountains, which for a time was the main green space of the city, but disappeared in the urbanization works of the Parque de la Ciutadela.. In 1771 the Edicto de obreria was approved, a municipal ordinance aimed at controlling private works in the city, which involved the regulation of the alignment of houses according to the layout of the streets, as well as the supervision of aspects such as the paving of the streets, the sewage system and the numbering of the houses. 19th century. In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked to the Industrial Revolution — especially the textile industry — which in turn led to a cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, which was the reason for the Eixample project, drawn up by Ildefonso Cerdá in 1859. Likewise, thanks to the revolution of 1868, the demolition of the Citadel was achieved, whose land was transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.This century was one of constant political changes and struggles between liberals and conservatives, which was often reflected in the gazetteer. The first political moment in which there was a dance of names was during the Liberal Triennium (1820-1823), although it was only reflected in three names: Pla de Palau became Plaza de la Constitución (Constitution Square), Plaza de San Jaime became Plaza de la Soberanía Nacional (State Sovereignty Square), and Plaza de San Agustín became Plaza de la Igualdad (Equality Square). The first two recovered their names after the triennium — with a brief period in which Pla de Palau was called Plaça dels Cercs (1823-1825) — but the third remained until the Franco dictatorship.. Among the main urbanistic actions of these years was the opening of Ferdinand VII street in 1827 —nowadays called only Ferdinand (Ferran in Catalan) — between La Rambla and the Plaza de San Jaime, dedicated to the then Spanish monarch. For some years it alternated its name with that of Duque de la Victoria  — the title of General Espartero — according to the political color of the moment: King Ferdinand for the conservatives, the general\\'s for the liberal periods (1840 and 1854). This street later had a continuation towards Borne with the streets of Jaime I (1849–53) — for the king of Aragon — and of the Princess (1853) — for Isabel, princess of Asturias. On the other hand, with the end of the Inquisition in 1835, the street that bore that name was changed to Count of Barcelona.Another factor that favored the urban planning of these years was the massive land confiscation of 1836, which left numerous plots of land that were built on or converted into public spaces, such as La Boquería and Santa Catalina markets, the Gran Teatro del Liceo and two squares designed by Francisco Daniel Molina: Plaza Real (1848) and Plaza del Duque de Medinaceli; the former was named after the monument it was to contain dedicated to Ferdinand the Catholic — now disappeared — and the latter after Luis de la Cerda y de la Vega, Duke of Medinaceli.. Likewise, the new sanitary dispositions promulgated at this time meant the disappearance of numerous parish cemeteries, whose plots were urbanized as new public squares: Thus arose squares such as Santa María (for the church of Santa María del Mar), del Pino (for the church of Santa María del Pino), San José Oriol — located next to the previous one —, San Felipe Neri (for the church of the same name), San Justo (for the church of the same name), San Pedro (for the monastery of San Pedro de las Puellas) and San Jaime (for the disappeared church dedicated to the apostle).The liberal government of 1840 brought about the change of name of the Plaza de San Jaime to Plaza de la Constitución, taking advantage of the end of the rehabilitation works of the square and the Casa de la Ciudad. It bore this name until the beginning of the Second Republic in 1931, when it was changed to Plaza de la República, while in 1940 it was returned to its former name of Plaza de San Jaime.. In 1842 began the labeling of the streets with marble plaques and cast lead letters. The origin of this campaign can be found in the bombardment of the city by General Espartero and the subsequent fine of 12 million reales that he imposed on the people of Barcelona, which led many citizens to erase the names and numbers of the streets — until then simply painted on the walls — so as not to be located. This led to the regulation of the street nomenclature, with a system very similar to the one used today.Around 1850 a sector of the village of Gracia was urbanized and its owner, Josep Rossell i Imbert, a jeweler by profession, baptized the streets with names related to jewelry: Diamond, Gold, Pearl, Ruby and Topaz.In the middle of the century, the Diputation of Barcelona was in charge of establishing new road layouts in the plain of Barcelona: the Sarriá road —currently Sarriá Avenue — designed by Ildefonso Cerdá and built between 1850 and 1853; the road from Sants to Les Corts (1865-1867); and the road from Sagrera to Horta (1871), currently Garcilaso Street.During the Progressive Biennium of 1854-1856 there were again some name changes: Reina Cristina street was renamed General Dulce, and Obispo street was renamed General Zurbano, both liberals. The Plaza de la Unión, so called because of the Liberal Union party, was also created. The first two were later reverted, although the Plaza de la Unión remains.In 1860 a royal order appeared that obliged the labeling in Spanish: In capitals and towns where the use of some dialects is still preserved, all street names will be reduced to the Castilian language.. The order was half obeyed, and voices were raised against it, such as that of the historian Andreu Avel-lí Pi i Arimon, who criticized the bad translations made in many cases. On the other hand, many changes were ignored by the common people, who continued to call their streets by their traditional names: thus, the street of Arco del Teatro was still known as Trentaclaus 25 years after its change, since the popular name appeared in parentheses in its entry in the 1879 Guía de Divisiones de Barcelona Eixample of Barcelona. Thanks to the demolition of the medieval walls in 1854, the city was able to expand on the adjacent plain. In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for enlargement (eixample) projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefonso Cerdá, author of a topographical plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerdá Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliación, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuïc and the Besós river, with a system of rectilinear streets oriented northwest-southeast, 20 m wide, cut by others oriented southwest-northeast parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Thus a series of square blocks of 113.3 m on each side were delimited, of which Cerdá planned to build only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation.The plan foresaw the construction of several main avenues, the future Diagonal (named like that because of its layout), Meridiana, Paralelo, Gran Vía de las Cortes Catalanas and Paseo de San Juan; as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuán, Glorias, España, Verdaguer, Doctor Letamendi, Universidad and Urquinaona. It also foresaw the opening of three major avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular avenue that would connect the Citadel with Montjuïc (Cathedral Avenue, partially completed). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would encircle the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universidad and San Pedro.The grid of streets designed by Cerdá was initially named by numbers and letters: the numbers corresponded to the streets that went from sea to mountain, and the letters to those in the Llobregat-Besós direction. This alphanumeric system was changed to a nominal one, thanks to a regulation made by the 4th Section of Development of the City Council. The nomination of the new roads was entrusted to the writer Víctor Balaguer, who was mainly inspired by the history of Catalonia, as he stated in his proposal: According to what is publicly said, the time is approaching to name several of the streets that are to form the new Barcelona, and there is no better occasion than the present to remedy the oblivion in which by bad luck have fallen certain glorious enterprises, certain famous names, which have been, and will always be, of glory for Catalonia.. Influenced by romantic historiography, Balaguer introduced numerous Catalanist names, opening the door for numerous Catalan towns that followed suit. He created several streets named after territories linked to the Crown of Aragon: Valencia, Mallorca, Aragon, Provence, Roussillon, Naples, Calabria, Corsica, Sicily, and Sardinia; institutions such as the Catalan Courts, the Catalan Parliament, the Diputation, or the Council of One Hundred; characters from politics, literature or the Catalan arts: Balmes, Aribau, Muntaner, Casanova, Pau Claris, Roger de Flor, Villarroel, Roger de Lauria, Count Borrell, Count of Urgel, Entenza, Ausiàs March, Llull, Llança, Alí Bey, Manso, Pallars, Pujades, Rocafort, Tamarit, Viladomat, Vilanova or Vilamarí; battles and historical events, such as Bailén, Lepanto, Bruc or Caspe. He also dedicated streets to Industry, the Navy and Commerce, and to the Catalan cities of Gerona and Tarragona. There were some modifications to his initial proposal, such as the street of the university, which in 1916 was changed to Enrique Granados after the composer\\'s death; and some names that finally did not materialize, such as Atenas, Desclot, Barceló, Capmany, La Coronela and Llobregat.On the other hand, and surely to compensate, the municipal corporation and the technical body proposed several names related to the history of Spain, such as Floridablanca, Sepúlveda, Enna (now Ramon Turró Street), Marqués de Campo Sagrado, Pelayo, Vergara and Trafalgar.The new set of streets was approved by Fomento on December 19, 1863, along with several additional provisions: the territory of the Eixample was divided between Barcelona and the adjoining municipalities (still independent) of Gracia, Les Corts, San Andrés de Palomar and San Martín de Provensals; the numbering of the houses was established; and the labeling was regulated, with a plaque identifying the street on the first building of each block — if it was not built, a provisional tablet was placed.The part of the Eixample corresponding to Sant Martí de Provençals was not baptized by Balaguer, but rather the Martinese consistory dictated its own names, some of them repeated, such as Balmes (now Fluvià), General Manso (now Josep Pla) and Sant Martí (now Selva de Mar), and some that still survive, such as Prim, Llacuna, Bogatell, Provensals, Pueblo Nuevo and Taulat.. After Balaguer\\'s proposal, several streets in the Eixample were named after him: Battles and historical events such as Almogávares, Las Navas de Tolosa, Dos de Mayo, Independencia, Los Castillejos, Wad-Ras (now Doctor Trueta) and Luchana (now Roc Boronat); economic concepts such as Labor and Agriculture; characters such as Peter IV, Philip II, Bac de Roda, Padilla, Sancho de Ávila, John de Austria, Andrade, San Antonio María Claret, Lope de Vega, Espronceda, Mistral, Wellington, Cristóbal de Moura and Buenaventura Muñoz; cities and provinces of Spain, such as Álava, Ávila, Badajoz, Bilbao, Cantabria, Cartagena, Castilla, Ciudad de Granada, Guipúzcoa, La Coruña, Murcia, Palencia, Pamplona, Vizcaya and Zamora; international cities, such as Paris, London, Rome and Buenos Aires; and countries such as Morocco, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.A particular case is that of Plaza de Cataluña, which has emerged in recent years as the first space located behind the city walls, just where Passeig de Gràcia begins. The Cerdá Plan did not include this square, which was intended to be a block of buildings (no. 39). However, it soon became a central place with a large influx of people, which attracted commercial and recreational activity, so that various entertainment and catering establishments were installed in the place. Over time, people began to call it by its current name, a spontaneous nomination of vague origin that came to be imposed in such a way that the city council had no choice but to make it official. Thus, when in 1860 Queen Isabel II inaugurated the works of the Eixample, the square already received this popular name, which was collected in 1865 by Victor Balaguer in his compendium of Las calles de Barcelona. Sexenio Democrático. The Glorious Revolution of 1868 again brought about numerous changes in the gazetteer. In a session held on January 26, 1869, the city council decided to change the following streets: Cristina for República, Fernando VII for Libertad, Isabel II for Alcolea, Isabel II (Hostafrancs) for Béjar, Princesa for Cádiz, Princesa (Hostafrancs) for Mas y Ventura — two lieutenants who staged a progressive revolt and were shot in 1866-, Rambla de Isabel II for Rambla de Cataluña, Pla de Palau for Plaza del Comercio, Plaza Real for Plaza Nacional and Plaza del Rey for Plaza del Pueblo. These changes became effective all except Cristina Street, which was finally called Prim and not Republic, and lasted during the First Republic (1873-1874), with the only addition in 1873 of changing the Portal de la Paz to Portal de la Junta Revolucionaria.. The Sexenio Democrático (English: The six democratic or revolutionary years) was also reflected in the towns of the plain of Barcelona: Gracia: Isabel II street was divided in two, Luna and Mariana Pineda streets; Isabel II square became Revolution square; and Príncipe, Princesa, Virrey, Virreina and Caballeros streets became Escuder, Argüelles, Maldonado, Torrijos and Zurbano, respectively.. Sants: Isabel II became Riego, Plaza de la Iglesia became Plaza de la Federación — for the Spanish Regional Federation of the International Workers Association — and a stretch of the Bordeta road was called Calle de la Constitución.. San Martín de Provensals: Isabel II square was renamed Prim square, and Princesa street was Topete street.. Sarriá: Isabel II became Libertad, Príncipe was Serrano, and Cristina changed to Prim.. Les Corts: Plaza de la Iglesia was changed to Plaza de la Constitución.. San Andrés de Palomar: Isabel II became Don Juan Prim.During the eleven months that the First Republic lasted there were no excessive changes, due to the short period, although there was an express will to make them, as can be seen in the promulgation of the following ordinance: Since the streets are not properly labeled and in order that their names do not have the religious tone that they have today, the names of the saints should be changed to others that are more appropriate and symbolize the present time.. With the Bourbon restoration all these changes were reversed, with a few exceptions, such as the Rambla de Cataluña, which continued to be called that way, or Béjar street in Hostafrancs, which although it temporarily became Isabel II, in 1879 returned to Béjar. On the other hand, in the neighboring towns most of the changes were not reversed, and many remained until the arrival of Franco\\'s dictatorship; some have even remained unchanged to the present day, such as Constitution Street. There were also some occasional changes, such as the Avenida del Paralelo by Marqués del Duero, in 1874.There were few other changes until the end of the century. In 1883 the cemetery of Montjuïc was inaugurated, which due to its extension was divided into streets that received names of religious sign. At the end of the century an event was held that had a great economic, social, urban, artistic and cultural impact on the city: the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. It was held in the park of the Citadel, a land formerly belonging to the army that housed the fortress of the Citadel — hence the name given to the park — won for the city in 1868. In addition to the Citadel, the Salón de San Juan (now Passeig de Lluís Companys), a long 50-meter wide avenue that served as the entrance to the Exposition, at the beginning of which was placed the Arc de Triomf, designed by José Vilaseca, was remodeled. The Paseo de Circunvalación, which surrounds the park on the south side, was also opened. 20th century. The 20th century was conditioned by the convulsive political situation, with the end of the monarchy in 1931 and the arrival of the Second Republic, which ended with the Civil War and was replaced by Franco\\'s dictatorship, until the reestablishment of the monarchy and the arrival of democracy. Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530,000 inhabitants, by 1930 they had almost doubled (1,009,000 inhabitants), reaching a peak between 1970 and 1980 (1,754,900) and by the end of the century 1,500,000 inhabitants. Municipal aggregations. The beginning of the century was marked by the geographical expansion of the city: in 1897 Barcelona annexed six bordering towns that had been independent until then: Sants, Les Corts, San Gervasio de Cassolas, Gràcia, San Andrés de Palomar and San Martín de Provensals. Horta was also annexed in 1904; in 1921, Sarriá and Santa Cruz de Olorde (a small piece of land in Collserola separated from Molins de Rey); in 1924, Collblanc and the Marina de Hospitalet, where the Zona Franca was created; and, in 1943, El Buen Pastor and Barón de Viver, separated from Santa Coloma de Gramanet. The city grew from 15.5 km2 to 77.8 km2, and from a population of 383,908 to 559,589.. With the aggregation of the neighboring municipalities and the new incorporation of a large number of public roads, it was found that there were numerous duplicities, since several municipalities — and also neighborhoods on the outskirts of Barcelona, such as Hostafrancs, La Barceloneta and Pueblo Seco — had streets with the same names, especially in terms of streets named after saints. For example, there were nine streets named after St. Joseph, and eight named after St. John. While this situation was being regularized, it was necessary to clarify the former locality of each street in the correspondence, so that it would reach its correct destination. In 1907, a report was created in charge of the nomenclature of the streets, thanks to whose work 361 streets were renamed to avoid these duplicities. The new names incorporated a new ordinance drafted in 1905 that established the dedication of personalities only ten years after their death.Different criteria were used to name the new streets: towns in Catalonia (Agramunt, Arbós, Calaf, Cambrils, Escornalbou); counties in Catalonia (Panadés, Priorat, La Selva); Spanish regions (Asturias, Extremadura, Castile, Canary Islands); illustrious personalities of the towns added (Agustí Milà, Pons i Gallarza, Guillem Tell); personalities of the cultural world (Bretón de los Herreros, Marian Aguiló, Ramón y Cajal, Jules Verne, Voltaire, Zola, Frederic Soler); republican or liberal figures (Doctor Rizal, Estanislao Figueras, Víctor Balaguer, Ríos Rosas, Rossend Arús, Suñer y Capdevila, Vidal y Valenciano); names from the workers\\' movement (La Internacional, Élisée Reclus, Emancipación); and figures from the past (Socrates, Pythagoras, Rubens, Titian, Pasteur, Mistral).. The aggregation also revealed a phenomenon that occurred frequently between the 19th and early 20th centuries: many plots of land previously used for agriculture were developed by their owners, who often gave their own name or that of their relatives to the newly created roads. There is for example the case of Pau Ganduxer i Aymerich, from whom Ganduxer street comes from, while he named Ganduxer square (nowadays Ferran Casablancas square) in honor of his father, Francesc Ganduxer i Garriga; Aymerich street (now Cerignola street) after his mother, Rita Aymerich; Carrencà street after his wife, Josepa Carrencà; and Torras i Pujalt street after his son-in-law, Joaquim Torras i Pujalt.Another paradigmatic case is that of the urbanization of the Torre del Simó estate, in Gracia, which led to the street of Santa Ágata for the owner, Àgata Badia i Puigrodon; the street of Santa Rosa for her mother, Rosa Puigrodon i Pla; Santa Magdalena Street by her mother-in-law, Magdalena Escarabatxeras i Blanch; San Antonio Square by her husband, Antoni Trilla (now Trilla Square); and, in addition, Badia Street, by her father, Joan Badia, and Trilla Street, by her father-in-law, Antoni Trilla.As a general rule, and somewhat inexplicably, most of the town councils of the towns of the plain used to approve these dispositions dictated by the landowners. For example, this petition by Miquela de Paguera in 1847 to the town council of San Martín de Provensals for a piece of land located in Campo del Arpa: She will open four spacious streets, which she wishes to name: 1st, of Don Juan de Paguera; 2nd, of Blessed Miguel; 3rd, of the Virgin of Carmen; 4th, of the Eternal Memory, to pay in this way a just tribute to that of her late husband, who made her happiness.. It should also be noted that with the aggregation, some of the roads linking the old towns were renamed. Thus, the road from San Andrés to Collblanc was divided into three: Solar, Travesía del Carril and Travesía — the three now form the Travesía de Gracia; and the road from Cornellá to Fogás de Tordera was also divided into sections: avenida de Esplugas, Obispo Català, paseo de la Reina Elisenda de Montcada, paseo de la Bonanova (\"Good News\"), paseo de San Gervasio, paseo del Valle de Hebrón and paseo de Valldaura.Also in the early years of the century, the slopes of Tibidabo were urbanized and occupied by single-family houses in the style of English garden cities. Its main artery is Tibidabo Avenue, a name that refers to the mountain and comes from a biblical quote: haec omnia tibi dabo si cadens adoraveris me, \"all this I will give you if you prostrate yourself before me to worship me\" (Matthew 4:9). A square is also dedicated to Doctor Andreu, promoter of the urbanization.Another urbanization of this period was the Can Muntaner estate (1900-1914), at the foot of Mount Carmel, in the neighborhood of La Salud, also designed as a garden city of single-family houses. The promoter was the industrialist Eusebi Güell, and the architect Antoni Gaudí was in charge of the layout. The project was unsuccessful, as only two plots were sold, and in 1926 the land was ceded to the city council and converted into a park, known today as Park Güell.In 1905 Josepets square was renamed after Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, who had been the French consul in Barcelona. In 1907 the Plaza de Ibiza was created in Horta, dedicated to the Balearic island; the same year and in the same neighborhood, the Rambla de Cortada was changed to Calle de Campoamor, after the Asturian poet. Also in 1907, Ancha Street in the district of Gracia was changed to Verdi, in honor of the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. On the other hand, in 1908, the so-called Dalt road, in Sagrera, was changed to Concepción Arenal street. In 1909, the road of the Waters was opened in Tibidabo, so called because it was built by the Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona.. During the first years of the century, the Port of Barcelona was enlarged (1905-1912), with a project that extended the eastern dock and built a counter dock and the inner docks. These works gave the port practically its current appearance, except for the construction of the south dock and the inner dock in 1965. Along its extension, it has the following piers: Adosado, Álvarez de la Campa, Atarazanas, Baleares, Barcelona, Barceloneta, Bosch i Alsina, Cataluña, Contradique, Costa, Dársena interior, Dársena sur, Depósito, España, Evaristo Fernández, Inflammables, Lepanto, Levante, Madera, Marina\\'92, Nuevo, Nuevo Contradique, Occidental, Oeste, Oriental, Pescadores, Petroleros, Poniente, Príncipe de España, Reloj, San Beltrán, Sur and Varadero.The most important urban development action during these years was the opening of the Via Layetana, which connected the Eixample with the sea, projected with the letter A in the Baixeras Plan of 1878. The works were finally carried out between 1908 and 1913, with joint financing between the City Council and the Banco Hispano Colonial. Initially it was planned to be called Bilbao, but it was finally named Via Layetana, in honor of the Iberian people of the Layetanos, the first known inhabitants of the Barcelona plain. The layout of the new road entailed the disappearance of 85 streets of medieval origin, as well as the appearance of new roads in the areas surrounding the road: some of them were named after heroes of the War of Independence, such as Ramon Mas, Doctor Joaquim Pou and Julià Portet; a street was dedicated to Àngel Baixeras, author of the urban planning project; and the square of Ramón Berenguer the Great, Count of Barcelona, was opened. Catalan nationalist period. In 1914, when the Commonwealth of Catalonia was created, the streets began to be labeled in the Catalan language. However, this only applied to the new streets, while the old plaques were not replaced. For a time, even bilingual plates were placed, made of enameled iron and larger than usual.The Catalanist sign of the consistory dominated by the Lliga Regionalista between 1915 and 1923 led to some changes in this direction: so, avenida Diagonal was renamed Catalan Nationality; Montjuïc de San Pedro Street became Verdaguer Callís; and Antonio Maura Square was renamed Fivaller. On the other hand, the conservative ideology of the Lliga was reflected in the dedication of some streets to businessmen and characters of the bourgeoisie, such as the Rambla de Santa Eulalia, which became Passeig de Fabra i Puig, for the businessmen Fabra i Puig brothers; on the other hand, the proposal to dedicate the Rambla de Catalunya to Eusebi Güell did not prosper.In 1914 Manicomio road was renamed Doctor Pi i Molist street, after the doctor and writer Emili Pi i Molist. The following year Avinguda de Pearson was created, dedicated to Frederick Stark Pearson, founder of the Barcelona Traction electric company. In 1916 Prat Street was changed to Rambla del Carmel, the main street of the neighborhood of the same name. On the other hand, in 1917 the old Sant Cugat road, called Passeig de la Diputació since 1879, was renamed Avenida de la República Argentina.. At the end of World War I, in 1918, and due to the Francophile tendency of the consistory, several streets were named with names related to the war: the newly created Plaza de Ramón Berenguer el Grande was called Plaza del 11 de Noviembre de 1918, date of the end of the war, although in 1922 it returned to its previous name; the Plaza de Estanislao Figueras was dedicated to Marshal Joffre (currently Plaza de Vázquez de Mella); and the Paseo de Verdún was created, named after a battle of the Great War.In 1920 the name of the Paseo del Cementerio was changed at the request of the merchants of the area, for whom it was not a very flattering name. It was renamed Icaria Avenue, in memory of an Icarian community established in the area in the mid-nineteenth century. During the Civil War it was called Avenue of the Social Revolution, and during Franco\\'s regime, Captain López Varela, to recover the name of Icaria in 1978.The last municipal aggregation, that of Sarriá, in 1921, again entailed the change of several streets due to duplicities and other factors. On this occasion, in view of the antecedents, the last session of the Sarriá town council proposed the new names, anticipating the Barcelona consistory. They had to change 70 streets, although of those proposed by Sarriá only 14 were finally approved, since the effective change coincided with the beginning of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, who disallowed diverse names of Catalanist sign.In 1921 the Sanllehy square was also created, on the border between Gracia and Horta-Guinardó, dedicated to Domènec Sanllehy, who was mayor of Barcelona in 1906. Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. With the arrival of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in 1923, the signage returned to Spanish. Councilman Ignasi de Ros proposed the partition of the bilingual plaques so that only the Spanish version would remain, but as it was very costly, they were all finally replaced.The new regime also made considerable changes in the nomenclature, although it took some time: in 1923 only Maryland Street was changed to Marqués de Foronda; finally, in 1927 a Ponencia de Cambios de Nombres de Calles (\"Street Renaming Presentation\") was instituted, followed by another in 1929. The new names chosen were generally names of the royal family, military, and episodes of Spanish history.Thus, several streets were dedicated to the Spanish royal family: Avinguda de la Nacionalidad Catalana (former Diagonal) became Argüelles, but soon after was renamed Alfonso XIII; Riera de Cassoles became Avinguda del Príncipe de Asturias; Avinguda de América was renamed Reina María Cristina, to whom a square was also dedicated on the Diagonal; Gran Vía P — the provisional name of a new road in Les Corts — was transformed into Infanta Carlota Joaquina street (nowadays Josep Tarradellas avenue); and the old San Acisclo road was reconverted into Borbón avenue.Another good number of streets were dedicated to military men: Calle de la Concordia was changed to Almirante Aixada; Calle Número 2 del ensanche de San Andrés became Almirante Próxida; Diagonal de San Pablo was dedicated to the dictator, General Primo de Rivera (current Avenida de Gaudí); Calle Letra X to General Magaz (current Plaza de Maragall); the current Plaza de la Sagrada Familia — then recently opened and unbaptized — to General Barrera; the Nueva de Horta road to General Martínez Anido (now Paseo de Maragall); a street was also dedicated to the dictator\\'s brother, Fernando Primo de Rivera (now Pere Duran Farell); the 17th street of the Les Corts urban plan to Captain Arenas; and the Ebro street to Colonel Sanfeliu.. In the district of San Martín, several streets were changed to events and characters linked to the Habsburg dynasty: Bac de Roda street to Felipe II; Fluvià to Juan de Austria; Cataluña street to San Quintín; Vilanova to Cristóbal de Moura; and Lluís Pellicer to Padilla.There were also numerous changes in Sarrià, reversing the last decision of the Sarrià consistory before its aggregation: Prat de la Riba square to Duque de Gandía (current Sarriá square); Nuestra Señora de Nuria street to Virgen de Covadonga; Doctor Robert street to Paseo de la Bonanova; Abadesa Çaportella to Reyes Católicos; Padre Miquel de Sarrià to Beato Diego de Cádiz; Nicolàs Travé to Avión Plus Ultra; San Vicente de Sarriá square to San Vicente Español; and Consejo de la Villa square to Poeta Zorrilla.Other changes were: Víctor Hugo to Paseo de San Gervasio, Voltaire to Siracusa, Mariscal Joffre to Vázquez de Mella, Fivaller to Antonio Maura, Regionalisme to Canónigo Pibernat, Solidaritat to Orden and the Plaça de las Glòries Catalanes to Glorias, simply.In 1929 the International Exhibition was held in Montjuïc. For this event the whole area of the Plaza de España, the Plaza del Universo and the Avenida de la Reina María Cristina was urbanized, ending in a series of squares that ascended towards the National Palace: Plaza de la Fuente Mágica (currently de Carles Buïgas), Plaza del Marqués de Foronda (currently de Josep Puig i Cadafalch) and Plaza de las Cascadas, as well as the Paseo de las Cascadas (currently de Jean C. N. Forestier). The avenues of Rius i Taulet and Marqués de Comillas (now de Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia) were also opened, as well as the Laribal and Miramar gardens, designed by Forestier. In 1942 the Paseo de la Exposicion was created in memory of the event.For the Exposition, the Pueblo Español (Spanish Village) was also created, an enclosure that houses reproductions of different urban and architectural environments from all over the national territory, designed by architects Ramon Reventós and Francesc Folguera. It is structured like a village, with a main square and several streets: Príncipe de Viana street, Caballeros street, Castellana square, Conquest street, Tercio street, Candil street, Alcalde de Móstoles street, Alcalde de Zalamea street, Cervantes descent, Maestrazgo street, Rius i Taulet street, Triste corner, Santiago steps, Church square, Aragonesa square, Carmen square, Bulas street, Cuna street, Davallada street, Peñaflor square, Mercaderes street, Hermandad square, Levante street, and Fuente square.. Also in 1929 the Jardinets de Gràcia (\"little gardens\") were created by Nicolás María Rubió y Tudurí. In 1991 they were dedicated to Salvador Espriu, who lived in the area. Second Republic. The fall of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera led to several changes even before the arrival of the Republic: on February 4, 1931, during the so-called Dictablanda (\"soft dictatorship\") of General Dámaso Berenguer, Councilman Martí Esteve proposed a series of initiatives to modify streets of the dictatorship: disappearance of military names, return to the previous name of several streets, recovery of the name proposed by Sarriá to several streets and changed by the dictatorship, and return to the Catalan version of several badly Castilianized streets. Two squares and an avenue that still had no name were also baptized: the one located in front of El Molino, called Blasco Ibáñez; the one popularly known as Cinc d\\'Oros, dedicated to Pi i Margall (currently Plaza de Juan Carlos I); and the avenue also popularly called Diagonal del Ferrocarril, which became the Generalitat\\'s avenue (currently Avenida de Roma).With the advent of the Second Republic on April 14, 1931, the streets were once again changed from Castilian to Catalan — which was not fully reflected on the plaques, as it was a slow and costly process — and numerous street names were changed. The new consistory, presided over by Jaume Aiguadé, took up the proposals made months earlier by Esteve, to which it added a hundred more changes, which it approved on August 26, 1931. Most of the changes of the dictatorship were reversed, especially those of the military and royalty and nobility, although those that were acceptable to the new regime were respected.Some of the most significant changes were: Avenida de Alfonso XIII (Diagonal) to Catorze de Abril, Plaça de San Jaime to Plaza de la República, Plaza Real to Francesc Macià, Calle Princesa to Pablo Iglesias, Calle Fernando to Fivaller, Conde del Asalto to Nueva de la Rambla, Marqués del Duero to Francesc Layret, María Victoria to Victòria Republicana, Cuarenta Metros to Carles Marx (now Vía Julia), Salón de San Juan to Fermín Galán, Passeig de Sant Joan to García Hernández (Diagonal-Gràcia section), Santísima Trinidad del Monte to Héroes Republicanos de Sarriá, and Marqués de la Argentera to Eduard Maristany — a curious change, because it was the same person. Streets were also dedicated to Salvador Seguí, Francisco Ferrer y Guardia, Pau Sabater, Prats de Molló, Santiago Rusiñol, Anselm Turmeda, and Bernat Metge.In the following years there were few changes: in 1932 Tetuàn square was changed to Hermenegildo Giner de los Ríos, and Alcalá Zamora square (now Francesc Macià) was created; in 1933 San Jerónimo was changed to Cèsar August Torras, Marqués de Foronda to Arturo Masriera, Padre Claret to Mutualidad,and Cameros to Amadeo Vives; and, in 1934, Garriga Bachs square to Josep Llimona, Crisantemos to Joan Gamper, and a few others of lesser relevance. In 1934 several streets that still had no name were baptized: Sabino de Arana, Bori i Fontestà, Valentí i Camp, and José Bertran, while Pau Casals was moved from an alley in La Verneda to a new avenue located between Diagonal and Turó Park.During the Conservative Biennium (1934-1936) the new mayor, Juan Pich y Pon, established several provisions regarding the nomenclature: respect for the names established in 1934; granting new names to new streets; plaques in Spanish and Catalan placed alternately; adding biographical information to the plaques of personalities; and written request from neighbors to endorse new names. The new consistory introduced few novelties, the main one being the naming of a new square at the intersection of Diagonal and Gran Vía de Carlos III after Alejandro Lerroux (now María Cristina).. During the Civil War, popular fervor led to the change of numerous public roads without even official approval or the placement of a plaque, simply the name written on the wall. Numerous names established during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera that had been maintained during the Republic were reversed. Numerous streets with religious names were also changed, preferably those in the center of the city. Other changes were of a political nature or in memory of union leaders or militiamen and combatants in the war. Most of the changes were made in the first months of the war, and many of them were confirmed by the City Council on September 16, 1937; however, some of the changes of spontaneous sign remained only in the popular collective ideology. The only change made on the initiative of the consistory presided by Carles Pi i Sunyer was that of Urquinaona square by Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia, on November 19, 1936.The new names were labeled in most cases simply in tar, although in a few cases handmade plaques were placed, as in Vía Layetana, renamed Vía Durruti, where a plaque made by the sculptor Enric Boleda was placed; or in Ferrer i Guàrdia\\'s square, with a medallion with the effigy of the deceased. However, these plaques were destroyed in 1939.Among the changes approved by the city council in 1937 were the following: Paseo de Gracia to Pi i Margall, Avenida de Borbón to Mariscal Joffre, General Martínez Anido to Paseo de Maragall, Concordia to Sitio del 1714, Plaza de Alcalá Zamora to Hermanos Badia, Mediana de San Pedro to Santiago Salvador, Avenida Nuestra Señora de Montserrat to Francisco Ascaso, Vergara to Antoni López Raimundo, Plaza de San José Oriol to Miliciano Desconocido, Obispo Irurita to Federico García Lorca, Pla de Palau to Ángel Ganivet, Santa Ana to Mártires de Montjuïc, Plaza del Ángel to Dostoyevski, Alta to Spartacus, Peris Mencheta to Friedrich Engels, Carmen to Kropotkin, Plaza de San Agustín Viejo to Néstor Majnó, Paseo de la Bonanova to Errico Malatesta, Plaza del Canónigo Rodó to Mártires de Chicago, Avenida de Icaria to Revolución Social, Obispo Laguarda to Revolución de 1936, Santuario to Barricada, Pie de la Cruz to Komsomol, Avenida Meridiana to URSS, Plaza de la Sagrada Familia to Ucrania, Plaza de Sants to 19 de Julio, San Pablo to Rafael Farga Pellicer, Negocio to Víctimas del 19 de Julio, etc. The ring roads of San Antonio, San Pablo, and San Pedro were also changed to three anarchist leaders: Tarrida del Mármol, Ricardo Mella, and Fermín Salvochea, respectively.Many other changes were not approved and remained at the popular level, among which we could highlight: Mayor de Gracia to Germinal Vidal, San Pedro Mártir to Amadeu Colldeforns, San Federico to Mártires de Sants, Marqués de la Mina to Capitán Arrando, Santo Domingo de Santa Catalina to Sargento de Milicias Francesc Vila, San Honorato to Teniente Coronel Díaz Sandino, Plaza de San Justo to Largo Caballero, Foradada to Bakunin, Avenida del Portal del Ángel to Doctor Pavlov, Bajada de San Mariano to Pancho Villa, Sanjuanistas to AIT, Plaza de la Trinidad to CNT, San Eusebio to FAI, Bertran to POUM, Nuestra Señora del Pilar to Libertad, Santa Magdalena to Los Rebeldes, Beatas to Anarquistas, San José de la Montaña to Pepe el Alpinista, Nuestra Señora de Gracia to Desgracia, Madriguera to España, etc.The last changes, made in 1938, were that of calle de la Industria to Miguel Hidalgo (now Paris) and San Jerónimo to Ángel Pestaña. Francoist dictatorship. The victory of the rebel side and the establishment of Franco\\'s dictatorship led again to the change from Catalan to Spanish and the replacement of many names. All the changes of the Republican era were reversed en bloc. At the beginning, there were a series of changes that were not officially recognized, as happened during the war, and soon after they were disallowed: Paseo de Pi i Margall was named after General Mola, although it finally kept its previous name, Paseo de Gracia; Plaza de Cataluña was renamed Plaza del Ejército Español, but eventually kept its name; Gran Vía de las Cortes Catalanas was initially dedicated to General Goded, but was officially awarded to José Antonio Primo de Rivera; Vía Durruti was assigned to José Antonio, but later recovered the name of Vía Layetana; and Plaza Hermanos Badia was provisionally called Plaza del Ejército Marroquí, but later received the name of Calvo Sotelo.At a meeting of the Permanent Municipal Commission held on February 25, 1939 it was agreed: The changes of names of the streets and squares of this city and school groups, in order to honor the heroes and martyrs of the Homeland and erase the memory of the passage of the horde through Barcelona, which sullied it with names of undesirables and foreigners, restoring, in addition, the traditional names of the city.. The same commission agreed on March 7, 1939 \"to return the names of all the streets and squares of our city to those they had before April 14, 1931\". This meant a radical change without regard for any consideration, without taking into account that not all Republican changes were of political sign, but that there were municipal agreements and changes aimed at alleviating duplicities, which with the reversion occurred again. Names that were not in line with the new regime also reappeared, such as Pau Casals, which in 1934 was changed from an alley in La Verneda to an avenue between Diagonal and Turó Park, previously called Victor Hugo; the former alley was renamed Cristòfor de Domènech, but with the Francoist reversion it became Pau Casals again, while the avenue returned to Victor Hugo, neither of them to the liking of the regime. Finally, the avenue was renamed General Goded, but Pau Casals Street remained until 1961, when the land where it was located was transferred to San Adrián de Besós.Another consequence of the reversion is that several newly developed streets that had been baptized for the first time during the Republic were left without a name, just a number or a letter, which is the usual designation of the new streets until their nomination. Subsequently, the names they had received were reviewed, and in many cases in which they were not names of a political sign, the Republican designation was revalidated.There were few exceptions to the reversion of names: Tomás Mieres street did not revert to General Arlegui, as it had been named in 1924; the plaza de la Sagrada Familia kept its name, instead of the General Barrera it received in 1927, perhaps because it was a religious name; nor was Gaudí avenue, which had previously been called General Primo de Rivera, initially changed, but in 1942 the change did occur, which was maintained until 1963, when the general was transferred to Ancha street; The Paseo and Plaza de Maragall, formerly Martínez Anido and Magaz, respectively, also remained, apparently because someone remembered that Maragall had translated Goethe — the Germans were allies of the Franco regime — although Martínez Anido was later given the Paseo de la Industria (now Picasso\\'s).There were also six exceptions to the reversion policy, all of them to honor the new leaders, approved on March 7, 1939: Avenida Catorce de Abril to Generalísimo Franco (now Avenida Diagonal), Gran Vía de las Cortes Catalanas to José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Avenida de Pedralbes to Victoria, Paseo de Fermín Galán to Salón de Víctor Pradera (now Paseo de Lluís Companys), Plaza de los Hermanos Badia to Calvo Sotelo (now Francesc Macià), and Paseo de García Hernández to General Mola (Paseo de San Juan in its section between Diagonal and Gracia).The rest of the public roads returned to their traditional names, as can be seen in a resolution of the Ministry of the Interior of March 1939: Paseo de Gracia, Plaza de Cataluña, Calle de Fernando, Calle de la Princesa, Las Rondas, Plaza de San Jaime, etc., will return to their old nomenclature, without prejudice to the City Council proceeding to a thorough revision of the names prior to 1931 that recall the antecedents of the Red-Separatist domination of this city, to honor other heroes and martyrs of the National Movement, to whom the roads in the project will also be dedicated.. Even so, between 1939 and 1942 several changes took place: Avinguda de Francesc Layret (Paralelo) to Marqués del Duero, Sabino de Arana to General Sanjurjo, Avinguda de Pau Casals to General Goded, Avinguda Presa de les Drassanes to Garcia Morato, Avinguda de la Generalitat to Roma, París (a section) to Berlín, París (another section) to Avenida de Madrid, Tarragona (a section) to Numancia, García Lorca to Obispo Irurita, carretera de Montjuïc to División Azul, plaza de Pi y Margall to Victoria, plaza de la Revolución to Unificación, La Internacional to Nación, plaza de Salvat-Papasseit to Virrey Amat, plaza de Canuda to Villa de Madrid, Llobregat to Párroco Juliana, Robert Robert to Ramiro de Maeztu, etc. Several new streets were also baptized: Alcázar de Toledo, Belchite, Plaza de los Caídos, Plaza de los Héroes de Espinosa de los Monteros, Salvador Anglada and Teniente Coronel González Tablas. In 1940, the square created by the burying of the railroad from Barcelona to Sarriá was named Plaza de Gala Placidia, after the wife of the Visigoth king Ataúlfo, who had his court in Barcelona.In these years the street of Pau Claris was also eliminated, which was awarded to its extension towards the sea, the Via Layetana, receiving the same name. On the other hand, Calle de Casanova was kept, dedicated to Rafael Casanova, perhaps because the surname alone was not so closely related to the character, and could be understood as belonging to another Casanova. The street of 26 de Enero was also maintained, which commemorated the Catalan victory of 1641 in the Reapers\\' War, because it coincided with the date of Franco\\'s entry into Barcelona.A new regulation of the nomenclature was made in a municipal session held on July 7, 1942, which ratified the reversion of Republican names and the changes made between 1939 and 1942, as well as collecting a series of new changes, some of new streets and others derived from a purge of names prior to the Republic but that had some leftist or Catalanist bias. Some of these changes were: Democràcia to Movimiento Nacional, Autonomía to Unidad, Solidaridad to Rubén Darío, Igualdad to Álava, Joaquim Folguera to Núñez de Arce, Suñer i Capdevila to Beato Almató, Zola to Padre Laínez, Paseo de Castelar to Donoso Cortés, Laureano Figuerola to Nilo Fabra, Mendizábal to Junta de Comercio, Pere Joan Sala to General Almirante, Pau Alsina to Secretario Coloma, Josep Nonell to Alcalde de Móstoles, etc.. The new gazetteer, published in 1943, also stipulated the labeling in Spanish. Some of the translations were not very rigorous: Carrer dels Ases (\"donkeys\") became Calle de los Ases; Carrer del Voló (a village in Vallespir) became Calle del Balón. On the other hand, some names in Catalan remained, such as Foc Follet (\"fatuous fire\"), Mare Eterna (\"eternal mother\", in allusion to nature, title of a work by Ignasi Iglésias) and Barri Vermell (\"red neighborhood\", perhaps not translated because of its possible association with political color). The incorporation of Catalan characters that did not have political significance was also allowed in specific cases, as in the new urbanizations of Sabastida (Vilapicina), with names such as Escultor Llimona, Pintor Casas, Pintor Mir, and Santiago Rusiñol; or Can Mora, in Sarriá, where the streets Pedro II de Moncada, Jaime II, and Elisenda de Pinós were created.Among the new names introduced by the new authorities were many of a religious nature, mainly founders of religious orders (Mother Vedruna, Father Alegre, Saint John Baptist de la Salle, Saint Louise de Marillac) and parish priests (Mosén Amadeo Oller, Father Juliana, Father Oliveras, Father Bundó, Father Pérez del Pulgar, Father Luis Artigues).A new reform of the gazetteer took place on March 4, 1947. New names of Catalan personalities were introduced, possibly due to the new orientation derived from the defeat of the Franco regime\\'s allies in World War II. They appeared as follows: Joaquim Ruyra, Cèsar August Torras, Joan Gamper, Hipólito Lázaro, Francisco Gimeno, Lluís Millet, Apel-les Mestres, Adrià Gual, Enric Clarasó, etc. It was also agreed to name the streets dedicated to characters with a qualifier that indicated their activity: Pintor Pahissa, Cardenal Cisneros, General Álvarez de Castro, Maestro Albéniz, Doctor Balari Jovany, Almirante Barceló, etc.In 1948, the Merced industrial estate in Pedralbes was urbanized, which received names linked to Falangism: Cinco Rosas (after the anthem Cara al sol), Luceros (idem), 29 de Octubre (date of the founding speech of the Falange Española by José Antonio Primo de Rivera), Hermanos Noya, Ruiz de la Hermosa, Manuel Mateo, Ramiro Ledesma and Onésimo Redondo.Another urbanization in 1950 was the neighborhood of Porta, in Nou Barris, whose streets were named with toponyms from the Balearic Islands: Lluchmayor, Sóller, Ciudad de Mallorca, Alcudia, Valldemosa, Pollensa, Deyá, Andrach, Porto Cristo, Lluch, Felanich, Formentor, Buñola and Jardines de Alfabia.. An urban landmark of the time was the celebration in 1952 of the XXXV International Eucharistic Congress, which allowed the urbanization of a new neighborhood known as El Congreso. The center of the new neighborhood was named Plaza del Congreso Eucarístico, and the new streets were given names linked to the event: Doctor Modrego, Cardenal Tedeschini and Cardenal Cicognani, as well as the streets of La Vid and La Espiga, elements linked to the Eucharist. Plaza de Pío XII, another of the congress venues, was also created.In 1953 the neighborhood of La Font de la Guatlla was urbanized, whose streets were named after flowers: Begonia, Crisantemo, Dalia, Hortensia, Jazmín and Loto. That year the Paseo de la Verneda, a neighborhood of San Martín de Provensals, was also created; the name comes from being an area of alders (vern in Catalan).In 1957 the first section of the Paseo Marítimo was opened, an idea that had emerged in the 1920s but had not yet been developed. It has several names depending on the stretch of coastline: Barceloneta, Puerto Olímpico, Nueva Icaria, Bogatell, and Mar Bella.. Between 1957 and 1973, José María de Porcioles was mayor, a long term of office known as the \"Porciolista era\", which stood out in urban planning for its unbridled speculation in real estate. During his mandate the city grew exponentially, due to the emergence of new neighborhoods to accommodate the strong immigration received at the time. Numerous streets were named after the regime\\'s personalities, such as the Falangists Roberto Bassas or Matías Montero, or names such as Mártires de la Tradición or Primera Centuria Catalana.Most of the streets of the Porciolista era arose from the creation of large housing estates, such as Montbau (1958-1961), Southwest Besós (1959-1960) or Canyelles (1974). The streets of Montbau were baptized with names alluding to the arts: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Ceramics, Music, Poetry, Dance, Song, Pantomime, Mime, Lyric, Rhythm, Harmony, Muses; or artists, such as Vayreda, Sorolla, Roig Solé, Clarà Ayats, Benlliure, Puig i Cadafalch, Domènech i Montaner, Arquitecto Martorell, Zuloaga, and Zurbarán.In the Southwest of the Besós some of the streets were named after cities in Occitania and Northern Catalonia: Béziers, Carcasona, Foix, Muret, Narbona, Pau, Perpiñán, Prades, Tarbes, and Toulouse. Others from Italian localities: Alcamo, Benevento, Cáller, Catania, Marsala, Messina, Oristán, Otranto, Palermo, Salerno, Sácer, Tarento, and Trapani. Finally, several were dedicated to Greece and surrounding countries: Albania, Chipre, Constantinopla, Epiro, Rodas, Croya, and Tesalia.In Canyelles, the streets were dedicated to literary figures: Antonio Machado, Federico García Lorca, Miguel Hernández, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Miguel de Unamuno, Isabel de Villena, Ignasi Agustí, and Carles Soldevila; also one to the Chilean singer Víctor Jara.. Between 1958 and 1965 the Zona Franca, an industrial sector located between the mountain of Montjuïc, the port and the Llobregat River, was urbanized. Its main thoroughfare is the Passeig de la Zona Franca, which is part of the Ronda del Mig. Many of the streets in this area were named with letters — for the north-south direction - and numbers — east-west direction. Several other streets were baptized with names related to industry: Steel, Iron, Aluminum, Nickel, Mercury, Cobalt, Lead, Tin, Copper, Bronze, Platinum, Uranium, Blast Furnaces, Fire, Energy, Foundry, Mining, Mechanics, Metallurgy, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Engines, Anvil, Die and Chisel. A sector of the Free Zone near the port was named in 1994 after seas, oceans and straits: Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic, Indian, Yellow Sea, Red Sea, Aral, Martinique, Suez, Malacca, Hormuz, and Dardanelles. Also located there is the main wholesale market of the city, Mercabarna, which is divided into several streets, the main one of which is the calle Mayor de Mercabarna, while the rest is divided into streets named according to their direction, Longitudinal or Transversal, plus a number.. In some cases, the naming of new streets was left to the whim of an official, such as a sector of the Carmelo neighborhood, whose streets were baptized in 1959 with names of towns in Guadalajara because the official had been made to memorize them as a child: thus, the Plaza Pastrana and the streets Sacedón, Trillo, Jadraque, Sigüenza, and Cifuentes. Also in 1959 the Plaza de Alfonso el Sabio was created, dedicated to King Alfonso X of Castile.In 1959 the Valle de Hebron neighborhood was also urbanized, whose name comes from an old monastery located in the area and disappeared in 1835, called San Jerónimo del Valle de Hebron, in allusion to the Palestinian city. Its main thoroughfare is the Hebron Valley promenade, which is part of the Dalt ring road; there is also a square and a park with the same name. In keeping with the name of the neighborhood, the surrounding streets were given biblical names: Betania, Canaán, Getsemaní, Gólgota, Haifa, Idumea, Jericó, Jordán, Judea, Megido, Monte Tabor, Naín, Nazaret, Nínive, Palestina, Samaria, Sidón, and Tiro.In the following years there were few changes, the most notable being the dedication of a section of Avenida de la Catedral to Francisco Cambó in 1972, or the conversion of the upper section of Avenida Meridiana en Rio de Janeiro in 1973. In the 1960s a road was opened next to the parish church of San Andrés de Palomar that received different names depending on the section (Salón Teniente Coronel Onofre Mata, Iglesia, Guardiola i Feliu), but in 1979 it was renamed as a whole as Passeig de Torras i Bages, after the ecclesiastic, philosopher and writer Josep Torras i Bages.Finally, it is worth mentioning the creation of several green spaces during this period: parque de Monterols, by the homonymous hill (1947); jardines del Mirador del Alcalde, by Mayor Porcioles (1962-1969); parque de Cervantes, by the writer (1965); jardines de Jaume Vicens i Vives, by the historian (1967); jardines de Mossèn Costa i Llobera, by the priest and poet (1970); jardines de Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, by the priest and poet (1970); jardines de Joan Maragall, for the poet (1970); etc. Democracy. The arrival of democracy again meant a profound change in the nomenclature, both by the alternation of the language again from Spanish to Catalan, as well as by the change of numerous names of public roads. The first decisions of the first transition consistory, presided over by Joaquín Viola, were three: bilingual labeling for all the streets of Ciutat Vella; taking into account the popular will of the residents of San Andrés so that the street of Orden would be called Ignasi Iglésias, as in the times of the Republic; and also returning the avenue of General Goded to Pau Casals — although the name of the general was transferred to a section of the Infanta Carlota avenue, between Diagonal and the Sarriá road.During the mayoral term of José María Socías (1976-1979) there were only two changes: to return to the street of San Andrés the name of Mayor, and to return the name of Icaria to the avenue of López Varela.The situation changed with the triumph of the PSC in the municipal elections of 1979, which gave access to the mayor\\'s office to Narcís Serra. The new consistory was more receptive to popular demands, which called for the return to the pre-dictatorship names, as well as signage in Catalan. In these years of transition, several popular initiatives arose for the recovery of old names, among them a proposal of the Congress of Catalan Culture. On the other hand, in numerous streets and squares some people and groups took the initiative to change the names or translate them into Catalan, even if it was through graffiti or printed papers placed on the street signs. Likewise, neighborhood associations proposed new names for streets inaugurated during the dictatorship and which had no previous name; thus, on December 20, 1979, the city council approved the change of the Paseo de los Mártires de la Tradición to Rambla del Once de Septiembre (Diada de Cataluña).. The new city council did not practice the policy of automatic reversion that was done during the Franco dictatorship, but studied all the cases one by one. In fact, many of the names established in the previous period were kept. The first decision of the consistorial team (June 22, 1979) was to return four important streets to their traditional names: Avenida del Generalísimo Franco became Avinguda Diagonal; Avenida José Antonio Primo de Rivera became Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes; Calle del Marqués del Duero became Avinguda del Paral·lel again; and Calle del General Primo de Rivera became Carrer Ample again.The main change of names was approved on December 21, 1979, when a total of 59 streets recovered their previous name or received a new one. Among the changes, Paseo de Sant Joan (a section of which was previously called General Mola) and Avenida de la Infanta Carlota (a section of which was dedicated to General Goded) were returned to their full names; and Vía Layetana was divided again between the homonymous section and Calle de Pau Claris. Among the roads that regained their names were: Autonomia, Democràcia, avenida de las Atarazanas, calle Nueva de la Rambla, Ramon Turró, avenida de Pedralbes, Riego, Prats de Molló, avenida del Tibidabo, plaza del Verdún, plaça de Vallvidrera, etc. The streets dedicated to Falangists in the Mercè neighborhood were dedicated to geographical features — except Ramiro Ledesma and Onésimo Redondo, which were not changed until 1983. Several others received new names: Francesc Macià, Lluís Companys, Prat de la Riba, Pi i Margall, Sabino de Arana, Pablo Neruda, Picasso, Bosch i Gimpera, Carrasco i Formiguera, Aristide Maillol, Eduard Toldrà, Joaquim Blume, Julián Besteiro and Lázaro Cárdenas.. In 1980 a Nomenclàtor de las vías públicas (gazetteer of public roads) was published that included the new changes made in the naming of streets, but nevertheless noted numerous gaps in the meaning of some of the streets of ancient origin. It was then proposed the attribution of unknown streets to homonymous characters listed in the Gran Enciclopedia Catalana, a fact that, however, distorted their initial attribution. Thus, for example, Calvet Street was dedicated to the poet and playwright Damas Calvet i de Budallès; however, it was later found out that it came from the owner of the land, Maria del Remei Calvet i Sagrera, so the dedication was changed again. The new version of the Gazetteer of 1996, in which more time was dedicated to research, corrected many of these errors and gaps.Between 1979 and 1981 several streets in Vallvidrera, Rectoret, and Can Caralleu, neighborhoods in the periphery that still had several streets duplicated with the city center, were changed. In these places the decision of the new names was left to the neighbors themselves. Most of them were dedicated to trees and plants, as well as some of them were named after operas (Parsifal, Lohengrin, La Traviata, Bohemios, Madame Butterfly) or names related to astronomy (Firmament, Satellites, Ursa Major, Nebulae, Milky Way, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). The streets Mayor de Can Caralleu and Mayor del Rectoret were also created.. In 1980 two squares were created in Nou Barris dedicated to characters linked to the left: Francesc Layret, lawyer and deputy for the Partit Republicà Català; and Ángel Pestaña, anarcho-syndicalist politician and leader of Solidaridad Obrera.Also between 1980 and 1981 the name of several streets that placed a qualifier before the name of the honored personage was modified, leaving only that name, among them several streets dedicated to musicians that all had the appellative Maestro. Some examples would be: Sculptor Enric Clarasó to Enric Clarasó, Decorator José María Sert to Josep Maria Sert, Pharmacist Carbonell to Francesc Carbonell, Lieutenant Colonel González Tablas to González Tablas, Pope John XXIII to John XXIII, Bishop Urquinaona to Urquinaona, Jurist Borrell i Soler to Borrell i Soler, Aviators Jiménez and Iglesias to Jiménez and Iglesias, Lawyer Ballbé to Manuel Ballbé, etc.In 1981 several minor changes took place: the dedication of the plaza de la Fuente Mágica to its author, Carles Buïgas; the awarding of the plaza de la Victoria to Juan Carlos I, in recognition of his actions during the coup d\\'état of February 23rd; the square popularly known as Plaza de las Ratas was baptized as Plaza de la Asamblea de Cataluña; and the squares of Wagner, Salvador Seguí, Emili Vendrell, Torres Clavé and Joan Llongueras were created.In the following years there were several changes, among which it is worth mentioning: Obispo Irurita to Obispo (1982), Encantes to Consulado de Mar (1982), Plaza de la Unificación to Revolución de Septiembre de 1868 (1983), Paseo de la Ciudad de Mallorca (a section) to Andreu Nin (1984), Plaza del Funicular to Doctor Andreu (1984), Paseo de Colón (a section) to Josep Carner (1984), Paseo del Triunfo to Rambla del Pueblo Nuevo (1987), Menéndez Pelayo to Torrente de la Olla (1989) and Valldaura to Pablo Iglesias (1991).. Also in those years, new streets were born and received their first names, among them: Plaza de Charlie Rivel (1984), Plaza de la Hispanidad (1984), Plaza de John F. Kennedy (1984), Plaza de Salvador Allende (1984), Plaza de Karl Marx (1984), Calle de los Segadores (1987), Calle de Josep Irla i Bosch (1988), Plaza de los Paises Catalanes (1989), Paseo de Don Quijote (1990), Plaza de Diagonal Mar (1991), etc.New parks were also created, such as Joan Miró Park (1980-1982), after the painter; Espanya Industrial Park (1981-1985), after the factory of that name; Creueta del Coll Park (1981-1987), a traditional place name (\"little cross on the hill\"); Pegaso Park (1982-1986), after the factory of the same name; Clot Park (1982-1986), after the factory of the same name; that of Clot (1982-1986), for the neighborhood; that of San Martín (1985), for the old municipality; that of Villa Cecilia (1986), for Cecilia Gómez del Olmo, owner of the land; and that of Estación del Norte (1988), for the bus station of the same name.Another of the concerns of the new democratic city councils has been the recovery of women\\'s names for the dedication of public spaces, in order to balance their presence by reducing the disparity with the male gender. Thus, public streets such as the Plaza de Juliana Morell (nun and poet), the Pasaje de Magdalena Giralt (wife of General Josep Moragues who was imprisoned for defending the memory of her husband), the Calle de Otília Castellví (poumista militiaman), or the jardines de Emma de Barcelona (founder of the monastery of San Juan de las Abadesas), to cite just a few examples. Public spaces have also been dedicated to international female figures such as Rosa Luxemburg, Frida Kahlo, Isadora Duncan, Marie Curie, Sarah Bernhardt, Simone de Beauvoir, Virginia Woolf and Anne Frank. On the other hand, there are also collective dedications, such as the Plaza de las Mujeres del 36, the Plaza de las Heroínas de Gerona, the jardines de las Sufragistas Catalanas, the Plaza de las Mujeres de Ravensbrück, the Plaza de las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, the Plaza de las Lavanderas de Horta or the Plaza de las Mujeres de Nou Barris. The Olympics. Another of Barcelona\\'s profound transformations came on the occasion of the 1992 Olympic Games. The event involved the remodeling of part of the mountain of Montjuïc, where the so-called Olympic Ring (1985-1992), a large enclosure that houses several sports facilities, such as the Olympic Stadium Lluís Companys and the Palau Sant Jordi, was located. This site is located on an avenue called Passeig de Minicius Natal, a military man and senator of Roman Barcino who was the first Barcelonian to win a medal at the Olympic Games; the promenade is located between the squares of Europa and Nemesi Ponsati, a promoter of sport in Barcelona, president of the Barcelona Swimming Club. In Montjuïc several roads were also named in memory of the games, such as the Olympic promenade, the street of the 92 Games and the street of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games.For the accommodation of the athletes, a new neighborhood was built, the Olympic Village of Poblenou (1985-1992), with a general layout by the firm MBM Arquitectes. Several of the streets in the new neighborhood were named after cities that had previously hosted Olympic Games: Antwerp, Amsterdam, Atlanta, Stockholm, Helsinki, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Moscow, Munich, Saint Louis and Seoul. On the other hand, the most central square of the neighborhood, located between the skyscrapers Torre Mapfre and Hotel Arts, was dedicated to the Olympic Volunteers, while another nearby square was named after the Champions. Other streets in the neighborhood were named after artists and writers, such as Joan Miró, Arquitecto Sert, Joan Oliver and Salvador Espriu, as well as the square of Tirant lo Blanc, the novel by Joanot Martorell.The Olympic Games also led to the creation of new parks and gardens, such as the parks of Mirador del Migdia, Poblenou, Carlos I and three designed by the firm MBM Arquitectes: the park of the Cascades, the Olympic Port and the park of Nueva Icaria.. It should also be noted that on the occasion of the Games, the city\\'s road structure was significantly expanded, especially with the creation of the ring roads (1989-1992), arranged as a ring road along the entire urban perimeter. Three ring roads were established: the Ronda de Dalt (from the \"top\"), the Ronda del Mig (from the \"middle\") and the Ronda del Litoral. The first two ring around Barcelona, while the Ronda del Mig runs through the city and has different names depending on the section: Paseo de la Zona Franca, Rambla de Badal, Rambla de Brasil, Gran Via de Carles III, Ronda del General Mitre, Travesía de Dalt, Ronda del Guinardó, Calle de Ramon Albó, Calle de Arnau d\\'Oms, Calle de Piferrer and Avenida de Río de Janeiro.The city\\'s beaches were also conditioned for the Games, thanks to a Coastal Plan whereby they were cleaned and filled with sand from the seabed, and underwater reefs were placed to favor the flora and fauna with a view to their regeneration. Along the seafront are the beaches of San Sebastián, San Miguel, Barceloneta, Somorrostro, Nueva Icaria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nueva Mar Bella and Baños Fórum. There are also the Gas, Bogatell, Bac de Roda and Mar Bella breakwaters, as well as the Poblenou breakwater.In the following years there were several name changes and new roads were also baptized. 21st Century. The turn of the century did not bring any substantial changes in the nomenclature, as the same criteria followed since the return of democracy continued. One of the first urban planning projects of the new millennium was the creation of the 22@ district, thanks to a modification of the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM. In Catalan: \"Pla General Metropolità\") in 2000. Its objective was to reformulate the industrial land in the El Poblenou neighborhood, a traditionally industrial sector that was to be reformulated by focusing on companies dedicated to new technologies. The name comes from the code that the PGM applies to urban industrial land, 22a, changing this \"a\" for the @ as a symbol of information and communication technologies.In 2000, a piece of land in San Andrés was also urbanized after the relocation of the La Maquinista Terrestre y Marítima factory, whose streets were given names related to the factory: parque de La Maquinista de San Andrés, calle and jardines de La Maquinista de La Campana, and calles de La Maquinista de las Naves, los Puentes and los Trenes.Between 2002 and 2003 several streets in the Zona Franca were named after concepts related to the struggle for peace and human rights: Amnistía Internacional, Derechos Humanos, Gernika (city bombed in 1937), Soweto (for the 1976 revolt against racial discrimination in South Africa), Jane Addams (pacifist and suffragette, Nobel Peace Prize in 1931) and Francesc Boix i Campo (photographer interned in Mauthausen).In 2003 it was decided to dedicate to Salvador Dalí a square located in front of the Sagrera AVE Station, which has not yet materialized due to the delay in the execution of the works of the station.One of the most outstanding events of the new millennium was the celebration of the Universal Forum of Cultures 2004, which allowed new urban changes in the city: the entire Besós area, until then populated by old disused factories, was recovered, the entire Pueblo Nuevo neighborhood was regenerated and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood was built, while the city was provided with new parks and spaces for the leisure of the citizens. The main spaces named for the event were the squares of the Forum, Ernest Lluch, Willy Brandt, Leonardo Da Vinci, and the Fusilados (for the reprisals of the Franco dictatorship in the Campo de la Bota, whose land was occupied by the Forum).In 2005, several streets in the Port of Barcelona\\'s Inflammables dock were named after international ports: Alexandria, Casablanca, Haifa, Lagos, Miami, Ningbo, and Tianjin. An extension was made in 2012 with more port names: Genoa, Rotterdam, Tarragona, and Shanghai.. Among the last changes of names made in recent years are: Calle de Posoltega to Paseo de La Habana (2000), Pasaje de Marçal to Avinguda del Carrilet — nickname of the Catalan Railways — (2001), Plaza de Gibraltar to Grau Miró — a monk from the 10th century — (2002), San Francisco de Paula to Palacio de la Música (2005), Avenida del Hospital Militar to Vallcarca (2006), Estévanez to Garcilaso (2007), Puente del Trabajo to Puente del Trabajo Digno (2008), paseo de las Cascadas to Jean C. N. Forestier (2009), Avenida del Marqués de Comillas to Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia (2010), Plaça del Marquès de Foronda to Josep Puig i Cadafalch (2012), Sagrera to Mayor de la Sagrera (2013), Teniente Coronel Valenzuela to John M. Keynes (2014), Calle del Almirante Cervera to Pepe Rubianes (2017) and Carree de Ramiro de Maeztu to Ana María Matute (2021).As far as new odonyms are concerned, several have been introduced in recent years, among which we can mention: Rambla del Raval (2000), Plaza Verde de la Prosperidad (2001), Plaza del Fort Pienc (2002), Plaça de Luis Buñuel (2005), Plaza de Charles Darwin (2006), jardines de Teresa de Calcutta (2007), Calle de Isaac Newton (2008), jardines de William Shakespeare (2009), jardines de Els Setze Jutges (2011), jardines de Winston Churchill (2012), plaça del Movimiento Obrero (2018), and calle de Gabriel García Márquez (2021).. On April 14, 2016 the plaza de Llucmajor, where Monumento de la República is located, was renamed the plaza de la Republica, in accordance with the monument. This is a long-standing demand of neighborhood associations in the area, which has been met by the new consistory of Barcelona en Comú emerged in 2015. The announcement was made on November 29, 2015, setting the date for April 14, \"Republic Day\" (for the proclamation of the Second Republic on April 14, 1931). Conversely, some gardens located in the square that were dedicated to the Second Republic were renamed Llucmajor, so the dedication to the Mallorcan town in the Barcelona gazetteer was maintained. For this reason, the Llucmajor subway station located in the square did not suffer any change in the name.. On the other hand, the consistory led since 2015 by Ada Colau studied changing the name of several streets related to the Bourbon dynasty, under the premise that they were inherited from the Franco dictatorship. The affected roads would be: the Paseo de Juan de Borbón Conde de Barcelona, the square and avenue of María Cristina, the passage of Isabel, the avenue of Borbón, the avenue of Isabel II, the square of Juan Carlos I, the street of Alfonso XII, the avenue of Príncipe de Asturias, the street of Queen Cristina, the street of Queen Victoria and the pier of the Príncipe de España. The first official change was made on September 23, 2016, when it was approved the change of plaza de Juan Carlos I to Cinco de Oros, its previous popular name. In September 2018, after a participatory process, the gardens of the Prince of Girona — one of the titles of the heir to the Crown — were renamed jardines de Baix Guinardó. That same year, proceedings were initiated to change three other names linked to the Spanish monarchy: Infantas gardens to Magalí gardens, Prince of Asturias avenue to Riera de Cassoles, its previous popular name — approved in February 2019 — and Borbón avenue to Els Quinze, a popular name among the neighbors coming from the old ticket of streetcar 46 that at the beginning of the 20th century went from Urquinaona to Torre Llobeta, which was worth fifteen cents, a figure shouted by the collector at the point that said ticket lost validity. In addition, the suitability of other public roads was also questioned, such as the street of Aviador Franco, brother of the dictator and participant in the bombing of Barcelona; that of Secretario Coloma, promoter of the Inquisition in the fifteenth century; or the plaza de Antonio Lopez, due to his activity as a slave trader. Thus, in 2018 it was agreed to change the street of Aviator Franco to Pablo Rada, mechanic of the same flight of the Plus Ultra piloted by Franco. In 2019 it was decided to change the street of Secretary Coloma to Pau Alsina, its previous name, a worker deputy. As for the Antonio López square, in 2021 it was divided in two, with a dividing line in Via Laietana: the part in front of the Post Office building was renamed Plaça de Correos; the part in front of the Llotja de Barcelona was named after Idrissa Diallo, a Guinean immigrant killed in the Zona Franca Internment Center for Foreigners in 2012.On March 7, 2017, the unification of Hispanitat and Pablo Neruda squares was announced, creating a single square dedicated to the Chilean poet. On the other hand, on July 16, 2018, the street name of Sant Domènec del Call, which referred to the pogrom of August 5, 1391 (Saint Dominic\\'s Day), was changed to Salomó Ben Adret (1235-1310), a medieval rabbi who was lender to King James I and director of the Talmudic school of Barcelona. In 2018 the Rompeolas Mar Bella was also dedicated to the pediatrician and politician Antoni Gutiérrez — known as el Guti — who was secretary general of the PSUC, who died in 2006. In this breakwater he used to fish, one of his hobbies, so it was considered the right place to pay tribute to him. A plaque with the poem Laberint by Joan Brossa was also installed. Regulation. The first classification of the streets of Barcelona was made in 1917 by order of the Development Commission of the Barcelona City Council: La redacción de breves leyendas explicativas del significado de los nombres de las calles de la Ciudad (\"the writing of brief explanatory legends of the meaning of the names of the streets of the City\"), written by Ramon Nonat Comas i Pitxot and Josep Roca i Roca, and finalized in 1922.In 1930 the report of the Ponencia de Rotulación de Calles, directed by Agustí Duran i Sanpere, was elaborated, in which a new classification of the streets was made, duplicities were pointed out and the ignorance of the meaning of numerous streets of ancient origin was noted.The next attempt at classification was made with the arrival of democracy, at which time the Spanish meanings were also adapted to their normative version in Catalan. In 1981 the Nomenclàtor 1980 de les Vies Públiques de Barcelona was published by Miquel Ponsetí i Vives, which due to the short time spent in its preparation suffered from certain errors and gaps. A revised version was published in 1987, under the supervision of Pilar Aranda.Finally, in 1996 a new version of the Gazetteer was made, in which the cards that Miquel Ponsetí had elaborated over the years were added, in which he carried out a deep investigation of meanings until then unknown, especially in terms of characters of former landowners who had baptized the spaces urbanized by them with their own names.At present, the classification and naming of public streets is regulated by the Barcelona Street Nomenclature Committee, which studies proposals for new names through a commission chaired by the City Councilor for Culture, with the participation of various City Hall departments: Public Roads, Cartography, Urban Planning, Population, Institutional Relations and Sports, Heritage and the Municipal Program for Women. Experts in various fields are also consulted, and requests and suggestions from civic and neighborhood associations are attended to. From this, proposals are made that are ultimately approved by the mayor.. Among the various rules that apply to the naming of a public street, it is worth mentioning the one that concerns individuals: in Barcelona a street can only be named after a deceased person five years after his or her death; exceptions can only be made in the case of people awarded the Gold Medal of the City, and only the head of state can be named after a living person.. Other rules to be taken into account are: the use of acronyms and abbreviations on public roads is prohibited; changes of name will only be made in cases of force majeure, so as not to affect the neighborhood; duplicities will be avoided, except in existing streets within the perimeter of the Poble Espanyol; if a duplicity occurs, it will have different typological assignment (for example, street and square); proper names will be written with their original spelling, except in the case of saints, popes, kings or royal personages; streets will not be named after personages solely for the cession of the land; for the dedication of personages, the approval of the family will be sought; the labels of personages will contain their biographical data on at least one of the plaques to be placed. Labeling. The names of the streets of Barcelona are marked by signs generally located on the facades of buildings, generally on street corners and intersections, at a height of 3 to 5 meters. They specify the name of each street, consisting of a generic name (street, square, promenade, avenue, boulevard, etc.) and a proper name. Some signs also offer information about the odonym, especially in the case of personalities, where their biographical data and their profession or quality for which they acquired relevance are usually indicated. The signs are usually designed with criteria based on their visibility: the letters must be of an adequate size to be seen from a distance, and the color of the letters and the background must provide a good contrast. In Barcelona there are 34,350 street signs (2009 data).Most signs are made of marble slabs, with the letters in bas-relief, composed of aluminous cement mixed with sand and black ink, and are fixed to the wall with stainless steel screws and nylon plugs. There are also road signs, which are usually placed on traffic lights or lighting columns, made of steel plate in white and blue colors, which in addition to the name of the road usually indicate the direction with an arrow and the street numbers; and vertical signs, with a white phenolic resin plate, placed on a mast.The labeling of the streets began in 1842 because of the bombardment of the city by General Espartero and the following fine imposed on the people of Barcelona, which forced to have well located the citizenship. It was made with marble plaques and cast lead letters, similar to those of today. Although nowadays the plaques are rectangular, originally they were of sinuous contour, in the style of the frames of paintings and photographs. They were generally made of marble, although sometimes they were also made of ceramic. They were placed in Ciutat Vella, where some still remain, and in the Eixample at the beginning of its urbanization, although in this district they have already been removed.. In 1916, tiles with letters also appeared, which allowed the names of the streets to be written on the pavement of the sidewalks. They ceased to be installed in the 1960s, since when they have gradually disappeared, although there are still some examples, such as in Londres and París streets. Between the 1940s and 1960s, street signs were made with tin plates, which were cheaper than marble ones. They had a bluish background, and the letters were silver. Later they were again made of marble.. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t\\t. \\t\\t. As for the numbering of buildings, as a general rule, the even numbers are placed on one side of the street and the odd numbers on the other, with the exception of squares, which, due to their morphology, are usually consecutive. Thus, for example, in the Eixample, the streets in the sea-mountain direction start the numbering on the sea side, with the even numbers on the right; and those in the Llobregat-Besós direction start on the Llobregat side, with the even numbers on the right. The highest numbering in Barcelona is on Gran Vía de las Cortes Catalanas, which reaches number 1198, not in vain is the longest street in Spain, with 13 km long. On the other hand, the shortest is Anisadeta Street, which is 2 meters long. Gallery.

The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors (for the convent of Sant Francesc), Pino (for the church of Santa Maria del Pi), Mar (for the church of Santa Maria del Mar) and San Pedro (for the monastery of San Pere de las Puelles). This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla?a del Blat as the geometric center, with a separation of the north and south quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. In the 15th century another quarter was added, that of El Raval (\"arrabal\"), thus establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.[21]\\', \\'In 1769 a reform was carried out that created five districts, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of La Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mainly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.\\', \\'Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts. The most notable were those of 1837, in which the city was divided into four districts (Lonja, San Pedro, Universidad and San Pablo); and that of 1878, after the demolition of the walls, in which 10 districts were established: I-La Barceloneta, II-Borne, III-Lonja, IV-Atarazanas, V-Hospital, VI-Audiencia, VII-Instituto, VIII-Universidad, IX-Hostafranchs and X-Concepción.[22]\\', \\'Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the twentieth century, with the aggregation of the bordering municipalities, a new administrative reorganization was carried out, again with 10 districts: I-Barceloneta and Pueblo Nuevo, II-San Pedro, III-Lonja and Audiencia, IV-Concepción, V-Atarazanas and Hospital, VI-Universidad, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gracia and San Gervasio, IX-Horta and San Andrés del Palomar, X-San Martín de Provensals.[23]\\', \\'In 1933 a new reformulation was made, also with ten districts: I-Barceloneta, II-Poble Sec and Montju?c, III-Sarriá, Vallvidrera and San Gervasio, IV- San Pedro and Derecha del Eixample, V-Raval, VI-Izquierda del Eixample, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gracia, IX-Horta, San Andrés de Palomar, Sagrera and Campo del Arpa, X-San Martín de Provensals, Clot and Poblenou.

This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla?a del Blat as the geometric center, with a separation of the north and south quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus.

      "{'input': ' Early life. Brimble was born on 28 June 1910, in Molteno, Eastern Cape, South Africa. His father was Englishman Harold Pierrepont Brimble and his mother was (Jane) Depua Mahadna. She was Bantu and worked as a nurse. Harold was originally working as a railways electrician from Bristol and had moved to South Africa as a 17 year old with friends looking for work. While there he enlisted in the British Army and was badly wounded in the Boer War. Jane was his nurse and she nursed him back to health. They were married soon after and had five sons while living in South Africa before leaving apartheid South Africa on 9 March 1912. Their sons and ages when they departed South Africa were John (6), Cyril (4), Ted (2), and twins Walter and Lionel (4 months old). They originally moved to Australia, but their whites settlement law caused them to move again. They travelled to Sydney before boarding the Makura for Hawaii on 6 May 1912. While living in Honolulu for 2 years they had another son, Wilfred Brimble on 16 November 1913. Both Walter and Wilfred would also go on to represent New Zealand at rugby league.. On 21 April 1915, the family departed Honolulu, Hawaii destined for Auckland on board the S.S Niagara. The family travelled in steerage with Harold occupation stated as a salesman, John and Cyril were \"students\" and Jane a \"housewife\". The whole family was listed, with ages in brackets as Harold P. (34), John (9), Cyril (7), Edward (Ted) (5 and a half), Lionel (3), Walter (3), Jane (30), and Wilfred (1). They were all listed as being English as nationality aside from Jane who was listed as \"African\" and Wilfred who\\'s nationality was American as he had been born in Hawaii. After arriving in Auckland the family settled in Onehunga, a modern-day suburb in central Auckland though at that time was considered more on the southern boundary of urban Auckland. While there a seventh son, Amyas, was born on 4 April 1917. Amyas and Harold both died in the Spanish Flu Epidemic. Harold died on 21 November 1917, aged 37, while Amyas died on 17 May 1920, aged 3. Playing career. Brimble grew up in the Onehunga area where the Manukau Rugby club was located at that time before it later moved to Māngere. They played most of their matches at present day Waikaraka Park.. His older brothers John Pierrepont Mhlabani Brimble and Cyril Brimble were both accomplished rugby and rugby league players themselves and Ted was to follow them into the Manukau Rovers rugby club.. The very first mention of Brimble in the Auckland newspapers of the time was on 28 January 1924, in the Auckland Star. It was not for rugby league, but for swimming. He placed third in the 50 Yard Juvenile race at the Basin Reserve in Onehunga at a celebration to mark the one year anniversary of the Manukau Cruising Club. He finished behind Roy Hardgrave who won and would also represent New Zealand at rugby league in the 1920s.In late July, Brimble was chosen to attend Eden Park along with 39 other boys on 1 August in order to help the selectors chose an Auckland Primary Schools representative side. Rugby career. Manukau Rovers rugby. In 1925 older brother John was playing for the Manukau Rovers rugby club senior side, with a Brimble listed in the 4th grade team and another in the 5th grade side, most likely Cyril and Ted respectively due to their age difference. That same year John was selected for the Auckland B representative team to play North Waikato in July.In 1927 Ted won a medal for the most improved third grade player award at the clubs annual ball at the Orpheum Hall in Onehunga. The senior award went to Cliff Satherley who would later switch to rugby league as well and also play for New Zealand. Walter Brimble won the same award for the seventh grade side. Then in 1927 he was still playing for their 3rd grade side, along with his brother Cyril. John was still in the senior side, with Walter progressing to the 6th grade with other brothers Wilfred and Lionel in the 7th grade A and 7th grade B teams. John was chosen for the Auckland A side to play Bay of Plenty making him the first of all the brothers to play a full senior representative match, with 5 of them eventually achieving the same feat.Ted made his first appearance for the Manukau senior side, which played in the B grade, in a match against Tramways on 18 August. They won a “sparkling game of rugby” by 22 points to 0 on their home ground. Their selection was last minute with only 6 senior players present they filled the remainder of the positions with their 3rd grade intermediate side which Cyril and Ted were part of. The Auckland team was playing the same day which most likely accounted for some of the absences, notably older brother John who was away in the side. The Auckland Star remarked that Cyril “at centre, played a good game, being ably supported by his brother, “Arab” Brimble, who delighted the crowd with his solo play”. “Arab” must have been an early nickname for Ted (who was more known as Teddy or Ted), perhaps on account of his skin colour.. In 1929 Ted had become a regular in the senior side which was now in the top division, making his first appearance at five eighth in their opening round match against City on 27 April. They won the match 30 to 9 at Onehunga with Brimble kicking a drop goal and John scoring a try. Karl Ifwersen, the former All Black and New Zealand rugby league international was playing for City, now aged 36. Brimble\\'s drop goal came after A. Bryers passed to him and he “side stepped for position, and potted a neat goal”. The following week Manukau beat Marist 8–6 with Brimble dropping another goal midway through the second half to give Manukau the win after they had trailed 6–5. The Sun newspaper said “viewed broadly, it was [Cliff] Satherley’s game in the first spell, and T. Brimble’s in the second. Brimble was actually Manukau’s handiest back. Only 18, he is a five eighth with a wealth of promise”. The Auckland Star commented that “the hero of the match, T. Brimble, first five eight, gave a dashing display for his size, being brilliant on defence and tricky on attack. He fumbled his passes on a few occasions, but made up for this, with a great field goal from an almost impossible position with Marist players all round him. He is very light (9 and a half stone), but is not afraid to go down on the ball in front of a pack of big forwards”. The following week they played at Eden Park against Ponsonby and lost 29–17. The Sun said “Bryers, Manukau’s hard-working and enterprising little half, and the nimble Brimble, were effective inside backs, and [Bill] Turei and Linden were both honest workers”. The Star said Brimble “showed up in the early stages for strong running, but later he was regularly pocketed, and his failure to send the ball along smartly often lost chances”.They played Training College again at Eden Park on 18 May and lost 25 to 11. Ted scored two tries in the loss. At one point he was involved in a Manukau attack “which went from one twenty-five to the other. [Alby] Falwasser, Linden and the Brimble brothers scattered the defence, and Linden was almost over”. His first try came after he supported Falwasser who was tackled two yards from the line and he picked up the ball to score. His second came when he received the ball from a scrum near the line and cut in to score near the posts. He scored again the next week against University in a 9–6 loss at Eden Park, touching down “for a fine try … after some bright passing”. Older brother John scored their other try. In a match with College Rifles a week later at Onehunga which they won it was said that he and Falwasser “were too well watched to be seen to advantage”. They had another win over Technical Old Boys at Onehunga a week later and the Star reported that “Brimble was up to his usual standard as a sound defensive player, being the only Manukau back to tackle his man low”. Then in their next match on 8 June at Onehunga they drew 10–10 with Grammar Old Boys. He gave Manukau the lead in the final quarter after “cutting in and giving Turei a clear run in”. The following week saw John sent off for talking back to the referee in a 6 July loss to Marist and a suspension for a week. There was relatively little mention of Ted over the remainder of the season as Manukau began their Pollard Cup games though the Sun did say that he stood out along with Albon and Satherley in a 22–3 win over North Shore on 3 August. At the club\\'s end of season prize giving it was noted that John had achieved Auckland representative honours while Wilfred and Lionel had been members of the champion sixth grade side.The 1930 season was to be Ted\\'s last playing rugby union. He began the year playing for Manukau once more but was to only play 6 matches for them from May until early June. On 3 May he went off with an injured ankle in the second half after having been “conspicuous” in the game prior. Earlier in the match he had been involved in attacking play with Jones and after he “carried the ball to Marist’s line … he fell heavily against the post”. He had recovered in time to play the next week against City at Onehunga in an 18–0 win. He was “prominent in good runs” along with Thomas. Two weeks later in a loss to Ponsonby at Eden Park the Star remarked that Brimble “was one of the weak links in the Manukau line, and the black rearguard were never really dangerous as a scoring machine”. The next week against Technical Old Boys he “got through a good deal of work” in a 9–6 loss. In his last ever game for Manukau he scored a try in a 17 to 8 win over Grafton. Rugby league. 1930 switch to Newton Rangers rugby league. In mid June Brimble switched codes to rugby league and joined the Newton Rangers side in the Auckland Rugby League senior grade. Newton was a central Auckland suburb slightly to the West of Queen Street stretching from Karangahape Road and upper Symonds Street. It was cut in half by the building of the Central Motorway Junction in 1965–75. His older brother Cyril had been playing for Newton for a year and a half and it was likely this connection that brought him across. His first ever match was against Marist Old Boys on 21 June at Carlaw Park. He played in the five eighths position along with Murray, while Cyril played in the centres. Ted was involved in some early defensive work and then later in the match secured the ball and “paved the way for Allen St George to score under the posts” with Cyril converting. The Sun wrote on 25 June “a notable absentee from Manukau’s ranks on Saturday was “Teddy” Brimble, the five eighth, who has forsaken rugby for league. Brimble has joined the Newton league team, and his absence was particularly noticeable on Saturday when Jones had to fill the vacancy. He did not show the same dash in a position to which he is unaccustomed...”. The Auckland Star wrote that Ted, “the nippy Manukau rugby five eighths, made his first appearance in the thirteen-a-side game, and created quite a good impression, for his alertness to dart into openings and speed on the move. He combined well with his brother, C. Brimble, who filled the role of centre with distinction”.The following week he scored his first points in rugby league with a try in a 22–18 win over Ellerslie at Carlaw Park. His try came in the second half after he supported McLeod and Hill who had broken through. He had earlier missed two conversion attempts and Cyril then failed to convert his try. Claude Dempsey then took over the goal kicking for their remaining tries. The Sun said that Ted, Newton\\'s “latest recruit, is making a difference to the back”. He played in a 5–0 loss to Devonport United and then in a 21–8 loss to City Rovers he scored his second try. It came early in the match to give them the lead when he scored following loose play after New Zealand international Claude Dempsey had kicked ahead, with Cyril missing the conversion. Newton then lost to Kingsland Athletic on 19 July at the Auckland Domain 13 to 5. Ted converted their only try to Ray Middleton who had taken a pass from Allen St George after he beat Claude List. The Auckland Star said “the Brimble brothers played their usual good game…”. They lost again, to Ponsonby by 18 to 7 though Ted performed well. At one point he “flashed away, but with only Wilson to beat lost possession” and in general “did great work on defence”. The New Zealand Herald said that he was the best of the five eighths. Newton then broke their run of losses with an 11–3 win over Richmond Rovers on the Auckland Domain. The Star reported that “the Brimble brothers gave a brilliant display”. They then drew with Marist on Carlaw Park #2 field in the final round of the 1st grade competition 16–16. The Sun wrote that “Ted Brimble was the star of the red and white constellation, and in fact there can hardly have been a better back than he on the field on Saturday. He is a wonderful opportunist, and on many occasions Marists was left lamenting when he intercepted lob passes. He has pace above the ordinary and was thus able to come to the rescue of his side frequently”. The result meant that they finished tied for 5th in the 8 team competition for the 1930 Monteith Shield. There was some confusion in the newspapers with the Herald saying that Cyril scored 2 tries but the Star saying that Ted had scored 1 after he “made a brilliant run from midfield and centred. McLeod missed the ball, but the kicker ran on to retrieve and score wide out”. The Herald in contrast said that he had intercepted a pass and kicked hard down field with McLeod unable to touch down Cyril came through to score. They went on to say that the weakness of Newton in their backs was Cammick and “the result was that much of the responsibility fell on the first five eighths, E. [Ted] Brimble, who played brilliantly and proved himself the big thorn to the greens. He is fast and thrustful”. The Herald in another edition said Brimble “played a brilliant game. His pace paved the way for two of Newton’s tries. Brimble is now back to his best form”. Newton\\'s first try came after Ted “made a beautiful opening and passed to C. Brimble, who scored a fine try between the posts”. His last game for Newton in his debut season for them was in their 15–2 loss to Devonport United in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition. Ted played well with the Star saying that he was able to “smash attacks with judgment and to initiate counter-moves which invariably spelt danger”. They also mentioned his lack of support in the backs, writing that they lacked “assertive wingers to follow through the efforts of E. Brimble and the previous two mentioned” [Hill and Dempsey].Ted wasn\\'t finished for the season however as he had begun playing in the Wednesday league which was made up of 6 teams. He played for the New Zealand Fertilisers company side which he was presumably working for as a labourer (which his electoral roll occupation status indicated). On 3 September against Chess Taxis they won 5–0. He and Butterworth “were prominent inside backs for the “Works”, who pressed hard early in the game”. They then beat Trotting Trainers on 10 September at Carlaw Park by 9 points to 0. He, Muir, and Butterworth “played fine football for the winners, who profited by the mistakes of their opponents”. In total they played 5 matches and finished second behind the Barmen side.. On 25 September it was reported that Cyril had had his transfer to Canterbury Rugby League approved. He had moved to Christchurch and initially at the start of the season began playing in their senior rugby competition for Merivale. He played the season with them and then in 1932 transferred back to rugby league, joining the Addington club. He would go on to represent the Canterbury side and then after moving to Wellington later in the decade represented Wellington also. 1931 Newton. In early April, Brimble competed in the Ōtorohanga Sports Club\\'s athletic meeting on Easter Monday. He ran in the 100 yard, 120 yard, and 220 yard races. For Newton in club rugby league he played 15 games and scored 5 tries through the 1931 season. The first grade competition was now competing for the Fox Memorial Shield for the first time which is still competed for to this day. Newton came 5th of the 7 sides with a 2 win, 2 draw, 8 loss record. They struggled on attack, scoring just 83 points in their 12 matches which was the least of all sides. In their opening match against the combined Ellerslie-Ōtāhuhu side at the Ellerslie Reserve they drew 5–5. The following week they were thrashed by Devonport 26–0 at Carlaw Park. The Auckland Star was scathing in its criticism of Brimble saying that Hill “was badly let down by the five-eighths, Brimble never giving a worse exhibition. It was appalling the way he fumbled and dropped passed. His surprising mistakes threw the backs out of gear”. They lost further matches to Richmond 6–3, and Ponsonby 20–8 before a three try performance from Brimble in another loss, this time to Marist 18–9 on the number 2 field at Carlaw Park. The Star was that his three tries were “well deserved”. Newton were playing with a young side in the 1931 season. His first try came after Francis passed to him and he scored near the corner. His second came in the second half after Marist had been on attack but “Brimble changed the situation by outpacing the opposition to score”, then his third was scored late in the match after taking a pass from Beattie. The Newton season took a slight improvement with a 0–0 draw over City Rovers and then a 14–3 win over the Ellerslie-Ōtāhuhu side at the Auckland Domain. They lost to Devonport 20–5 and then Marist 17–9 on rounds 9 and 10 respectively. Both sides would finish champions and runners up. Brimble scored a try in the loss to Marist. He had missed a conversion in the first half but secured 3 points with a try following some attacking back play. It was said that he was “sound on both defence and attack” along with Ray Middleton, Allen St George, and A. Pope. In a 12–7 loss to Ponsonby at Stafford Park in Northcote on Auckland\\'s North Shore he played his “usual sure game for Newton”. The following week they lost to Richmond 8–0 at Carlaw Park with Brimble said to be “the pick of the backs” along with Hill. Their final regular season match of the year saw Newton secure a rare win, 23–10 over City Rovers. City were weakened with 5 regular players absent but Newton beat them easily enough with Brimble “prominent” in their performance. Newton played against Hamilton twice, on August 9 and August 22. The first match was at Hinemoa Park in Hamilton and saw Newton win 28-6 with Brimble scoring a try. Their season ended 3 weeks later when they were thrashed by Devonport in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition. 1932 New Zealand selection v England. The 1932 season was a remarkable one for Ted Brimble, gaining selection for New Zealand to play a test match against the touring England. He had had an impressive season for Newton, scoring 6 tries in 10 matches for them. They finished last of the 6 sides but had been competitive in almost all their matches with their biggest loss by only 7 points with several just 1 or 2 points.. In Newton\\'s opening round match against City on 30 April, Brimble scored a try in an 18–5 win at the Auckland Domain. The  2 rounds later he scored a try in an 8–8 draw against Devonport at Carlaw Park. He was said to be “as usual, always a thorn in the side of the opposition”. His try came after Allen St George “initiated a clever movement and sent Brimble over for a try under the posts” which Claude Dempsey converted. He was involved in several other attacking movements in the second half but they were unable to score the winning try. Then in a 15–13 win over Richmond he “gave a mercurial and incisive display, and with good support right through, the Newton backs worked like a machine”. The Herald wrote that “brilliant play by Brimble was a feature of the game between Newton and Richmond. His keen anticipation, sure handling and crisp passing delighted the spectators, while he used his speed with great effect. The five-eighths inspired several fine movements among the backs, and paved the way for Newton’s victory. Such a brilliant display of back play has not been witnessed on the number two ground this season”. He was involved in an attacking movement which led to an early Newton penalty goal, then he secured the ball and outran the opposition to score. At the start of the second half he “made a sparkling run and sent a long pass to [Ray] Middleton who scrambled over wide out”. Then a while later he punted high, chased and put pressure on Richmond enabling Arnold Porteous to score from the “ensuing melee”. In a 13–10 loss to Marist on 4 June he was said to have been “the best of their inside backs, taking all sorts of passes and handling the ball on unselfishly”. He scored another try in the match with the Herald saying “Brimble, first five-eighths, played a fine all-round game, his try being a clever effort. A tendency to run across the field was his only fault”. Then a week later in a 13–13 draw with City, Brimble “maintained his form of the previous Saturday, and his incisive dash and sharp penetration on attack made the Newton back line a force to be reckoned with”. Against Ponsonby in round 7, in a 7–5 loss he “made a brilliant run through the Ponsonby team and was only stopped ten yards from the line” with Charles Allen scoring shortly afterwards. A minute later he beat Frank Delgrosso but Ponsonby narrowly escaped. Newton then lost 18–17 to Devonport who were the competition leaders and on the verge of sealing the 1932 championship. Brimble “showed head work and resource to make countless openings in attack, and R. Pope teamed in well beside him”. Brimble added to his try tally for the season scoring his fifth. In round 9 Newton lost to Richmond 13–6. The match was notable for the debut in rugby league of Bert Cooke, the famous All Black rugby union player. Brimble opened the scoring for Newton after crossing for a try from a “scramble”, giving them a 3–2 lead. The Herald wrote that Pope and Brimble “were associated in some clever passing which delighted the spectators”. Newton\\'s final match in the Fox Memorial competition did not come until 13 August. It had been scheduled for 9 July but due to heavy rain it was postponed. With the England team touring and the need for an Auckland side to be selected to play against them the final round was delayed several weekends.. On 16 July an Auckland XIII side played South Auckland (Waikato) at Carlaw Park. On the same day a trial match was played between Possible and Probable sides with Brimble being selected for the Possibles team. He was chosen in the five eighths alongside O’Donnell of Devonport with Wilf Hassan inside them at halfback. He was opposed by current and future New Zealand internationals Stan Prentice and Dick Smith. Bert Cooke had been chosen ahead of Brimble for the Auckland side with the Auckland Star writing “it is open to question whether Cooke (Richmond) should have been given preference over Brimble (Newton)… Brimble is remarkably speedy off the mark, having developed into a class player this season”. Brimble\\'s side lost 26–12. He was involved in a try to Hobbs after making a “nice run before passing” to the try scorer. He later made another “nice run” but held on instead of passing to Allan Seagar who “could have scored”.Brimble missed North Island selection to play in the inter-island match with Thomas McClymont . The Herald wrote “the inclusion of Prentice will come as a surprise to followers of the code, as the Richmond five-eighths has not shown good club form this season. He was overshadowed on Saturday by Brimble in the trial match”. Ted was however selected for the Possibles in another trial match which was played on 23 July as curtain-raiser to the inter-island match at Carlaw Park. He was playing in the five eighths positions alongside Harry Johns of Richmond. Johns would die tragically 10 weeks later on 4 October after having been knocked out the night before in a boxing match at the Auckland Town Hall. Opposite the pair were O’Donnell and Smith. Before a crowd of 15,000 the Possibles side won a high scoring game by 37 to 16 with Brimble scoring one of their seven tries. It came after he outpaced Claude Dempsey “to score a nice try”. Newton then completed their delayed match against Marist which was lost 10–6 at Ellerslie Reserve on 13 August. Newton ended up finishing equal last of the 6 sides with Richmond despite their for and against record being 104–108 which showed how competitive they had been. The Star said “Brimble was the best back on the ground. His proclivity for finding gaps, his elusiveness and speed, were a pleasure, whilst his defence was notable”. New Zealand 1932 selection. The touring England had won the first two test matches with New Zealand by 19 to 14 on 6 August and 25–14 on 13 August. Brimble was then chosen for New Zealand to play in the third test at Carlaw Park. The Auckland Star wrote “the inclusion of Brimble in the first berth will be hailed with satisfaction. There are many good judges who consider that the clever little Newtonian has been mistakenly overlooked for big games. He should link up well with the scrum half, Abbott”. He was at five eighth alongside veteran Hec Brisbane with Abbott at halfback. Opposite them were Stan Brogden and Bryn Evans for England. Brimble was replacing Wilf Hassan and The Herald said “a promising young player, Brimble has shown good form throughout the season in club football”.. The match was played before a crowd of around 13,000 at Carlaw Park and saw England win 20–18 with a last minute try. New Zealand kicked a penalty after 2 minutes to take a 2–0 lead, then less than 2 minutes later “from play in England’s twenty-five, Brimble secured and sent to Cooke, who made a fine opening before giving Brisbane a clear run in”. With New Zealand leading 5–0 “Brisbane, List, Brimble and Campbell … featured in some great tackling”. Later in the half with the score tied 8–8 Cooke had mishandled the ball but “instead of being given the benefit of the advantage rule, New Zealand, for whom Brimble had touched down near the posts, were brought back for a scrum”. At one point in the first half Brimble nearly let in a try after being fooled by a dummy from Bryn Evans but England failed to score. Then with England leading 12–8 “the crowd cheered themselves hoarse when a long kick by Brisbane bounced awkwardly for Sullivan. Cooke, Brimble and Watene were following up and Cooke gathered the ball and had a clear run in”. Late in the match with New Zealand leading 18–17 “Brimble made a mistake in attempting to beat Stan Brogden instead of passing” after attempting to cut through from a scrum in the English half. As a result, Gus Risman flashed in, secured the ball “and started a passing bout”, the Auckland Star said that Brogden knocked the ball on but it was missed by the referee and after the ball reached Artie Atkinson he cut through, drawing and passing to Barney Hudson who scored the match winning try in the corner.Following the test Brimble was selected for Auckland to play South Auckland (Waikato) in Huntly on 2 October alongside George Mills of Ponsonby in the five eighths positions with Kenneth Peckham and Edwin Abbott opposite them in the South Auckland side. Auckland won the match 35–8 before 700 spectators to win the Sunshine Cup charity match. His final game of the season came for an Auckland XIII against Marist Old Boys as a charity match to raise money for Trevor Hanlon to assist him and his family to return from England where he had been playing but had fallen on hard times. The Marist side won 27–16. Brimble played well combining “cleverly” with Crook. Brimble and Prentice “were a lively pair at five eighths”. Around the same time the Manukau rugby league club had reformed at Onehunga with Ted\\'s younger brother Lionel on the committee. Ted\\'s other younger brother Walter would go on to represent their senior side later in the decade and gain New Zealand selection from there. 1933 Newton and Auckland. Brimble once again turned out for Newton in a similar back-line to the previous year. In their opening game he scored a try in a 25–11 win over Richmond at Carlaw Park. He “linked up in dashing style with [Arnold] Porteous, who was in great fettle”. The Herald wrote that “Porteous, Brimble and [Laurie] Barchard were the outstanding backs. Brimble was particularly good, making frequent openings which led to tries”. Brimble then starred in a 16–12 win over City.  The Auckland Star said “Brimble, the Newton five-eighths covered himself with glory. This young back was the outstanding player on the park on the day. He ran, handled and defended with real brilliance and has obviously profited by his brief international experience last season. His speed off the mark and guile made him a perfect pivot for the four three-quarter line…”. The Herald said he “was the outstanding back for Newton. He was in every movement and always dangerous on attack”. Ted scored again in their third victory, on 13 May against Devonport by 11 points to 8. He impressed the journalists once more with the Star writer saying “Brimble again shone. His play in the last stages was a revelation, and the winning try seemed but a just reward”. The Herald said they had “more thrust” in their back movements and better passing and “this in a large measure can be accounted for by Brimble’s quickness off the mark which gave his outside men a chance to get on the move”. He, “after settling down, was in fine form, and his try was a brilliant solo effort in which he beat several defenders”. Newton suffered their first loss in round 4 to Marist by 11 points to 6. Marist moved Hec Brisbane to five eighth and he “bottled up Brimble effectively”, despite this he was still “the best back”. He saved a try in the first half from a kick ahead and then towards the end he scored “after a melee near the posts” though his conversion attempt hit the crossbar. Newton lost to Ponsonby 28–17 and then Richmond 18–10. Ted was “unable to make his usual piercing runs, but his defence and anticipation were superb”.Brimble\\'s form had been good enough to gain selection for Auckland for their match again Taranaki who were playing in Auckland for the first time in 19 years. He was paired with Dick Smith in the five eighths positions with Wilf Hassan captaining the side at halfback. J. Arnold and F. McLaggan were the Taranaki five eighths. Auckland won 32–20 at Carlaw Park before 10,000 spectators. The Star wrote that “Brimble and Smith were both snappy, particularly Brimble, who was always in attacking movements”. The Herald said Brimble was “disappointing at first five-eighths and repeatedly dropped his passes” after being bustled by the Taranaki forwards.He returned to the Newton side on 17 June to play City. They were thrashed 35–13 with Brimble injured during the match. His injury came early in the second half when he collided with his teammate Cameron. Cameron left the field meaning they had to play with twelve men, while “Brimble was palpably lame”. In the first half he had stood out but “was only a passenger over the concluding stages owing to a severe kick on the knee”. He had scored a first half try after he “made a beautiful opening and easily beat the City backs to score a fine try”. Both Brimble and Cameron missed Newton\\'s next match which was a loss to Devonport. He returned the following week in a 24–8 loss to Marist in which he and Arnold Porteous “impressed”. It was reported after the game however that Brimble “is not showing the form of last season”. He got the better of Hec Brisbane early in the match after gathering the ball and beating him before passing to Pope who scored. Newton then beat Ponsonby 27–15 to finish the Fox Memorial competition in 4th place of the 6 sides and he was said to be in “good form” along with Porteous, scoring a try and kicking a rare conversion.Ted was then selected for a trial match to play a curtain raiser to Auckland v South Auckland on 15 July for the B Team. They lost the match 16–9 though there was no mention of him in any match reports and the teams seemed jumbled from how they were initially listed. Following a match for Newton against Richmond on 29 July he was selected in the Auckland squad to travel to New Plymouth in Taranaki to play the local side. The match was not well covered and he was not mentioned in any of the match reports with Auckland winning 25–17 before a crowd of 2,000 at Western Park in New Plymouth.. After returning to Auckland, Brimble played 5 more matches for Newton in a Challenge Round competition which involved all teams playing each other once more. Newton won the competition winning all 5 of their matches. He was “prominent” in their first win over Marist by 13 points to 11. The Herald said in their 14–5 win over Devonport the following week that he had shown “improved form”. He was possibly injured around this time as there was no further mention of him in the season and he did not play in Newton\\'s match with the touring St. George side from New South Wales on 11 October. He had been named to play in all 3 challenge cup matches but with his position being a prominent one it is possible he was absent. 1934 broken collarbone and comeback. In Newton\\'s 1934 opening game on 28 April Brimble was described as “erratic at times” with his five eighth partner, Roy Bright. They were both “weak in handling” in the 18–7 loss to Richmond. The following week they beat City 32–3. Brimble “who has years of play ahead of him, was really brilliant and undoubtedly he is striking the form which distinguished his promise of three years ago”. On 12 May the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park with 17,000 in attendance. Newton beat Devonport in the early game by 18 points to 8 with Brimble and halfback Arnold Porteous doing “useful work on attack”. Against Ponsonby, Newton lost 8–5 with Porteous going off injured with “neither Brimble nor Crook” able to “satisfactorily fill the gap”. Though he along with Crook and Pope “were alert and clever” and his try was “a good effort”. Ted scored again in a 22–13 win over Marist. He was said to be “magnificent at five-eighth”. Claude Dempsey played an outstanding game at full back with Brimble “the best of the other backs”. Newton lost a match that was described as “the most varied and stirring club match seen for many a day” to Richmond by 3 points to 2. Brimble was “always in the picture” and was “now in top form”. During the first half McNeil and Ted Mincham both left the field for Richmond with injuries and then Ray Lawless for Richmond and Reuban Kelsall for Newton were both ordered off for fighting. Mortimer Stephens, who had played professionally for St Helens and Brimble were said to be the best of the Newton backs. Stephens son Owen Stephens went on the represent both New Zealand (1968) and Australia (1973–74) at rugby union and the Parramatta rugby league team in 1975 and 1977, along with Wakefield Trinity in 1975.Brimble himself must have been injured late in the game because an advertisement in the Auckland Star in late July said that he had received £10 from an insurance scheme for breaking his collarbone playing rugby league. He missed Newton\\'s matches against City, Devonport, and Ponsonby, before returning to play against Marist on 7 July. Newton won 9 to 8 with New Zealand international Roy Hardgrave playing on the wing for Newton. Hardgrave had just returned from playing for St Helens for 5 seasons, rejoining the Newton club with which he had played for from 1924 to 1929. Brimble “was at his top form, revealing that the rest following his recent injury has done him good. His brilliant and elusive running and fine supporting play was only curbed when the Marist hooker Steven began to get ball from the scrums”. In an 11–7 win over Richmond he played “a good all-round game” but apparently kicked too much as did his opposite, Stan Prentice. Newton then beat City 17–5 and “Brimble again revealed exhilarating brilliance, and his pace, thrustfulness and well timed passes meant much to the nimble Schlesinger”, a recent recruit from the Point Chevalier club. He was “in his best form at first five-eighths, and did a great deal of clever work both on attack and defence”. The Herald wrote that “he frequently made gaps in the defence on Saturday by nippy and penetrating runs. He quickly seized his chance when he slipped over for a nice try”. He missed their next match with Devonport after suffering from influenza.Ted recovered in time to be selected for Auckland to play against Northland at Carlaw Park on 11 August. He was playing alongside Brian Riley from Ponsonby with Vincent Axmann of the City club at halfback. Auckland won the match 19–12. Brimble was involved in Riley\\'s opening try after they had found themselves down on the scoreboard. The Auckland Star said “Brimble did some clever things, but was not assisted much by the extremely low and wide passes handed out from the scrum base by Axmann”. The Herald commented that Arthur Kay and Brimble “justified the confidence of the selectors”, with Brimble having a “busy day watching [Ted] Meyer” the Northland five eighth, who had previously represented New Zealand, who played brilliantly.Brimble then finished the season playing several games for Newton. They were knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the first round by City on 18 August 14 points to 9. He was “prominent for good play” along with Brady. This placed Newton in the Phelan Shield competition which was being played for the first ever time in this 1934. It was essentially a consolation knockout competition. Newton went on to win it in its inaugural season. They beat Mount Albert 7–3, Devonport 11–8, and Ponsonby in the final on 8 September by 18 points to 10. In the final he, along with Cameron were “the star pair” and he crossed for one of their four tries. The win meant that Newton had qualified to play in the Stormont Shield (champion of champions) final against Richmond who had won both the championship and the Roope Rooster competition.. Brimble was chosen in the reserves to play for Auckland against South Auckland on 15 September but was not required to play. Then in September–October the New South Wales champions, Western Suburbs club from Sydney travelled to Auckland to play 5 club matches. The second of these was against Newton on 26 September at Carlaw Park. The match was drawn 10–10. Brimble played well with Cameron, and the pair “harassed their opponents by their pace off the mark” though “their collaborative work on attack… was less impressive”. Newton played their last match of the season in the Stormont Shield final on 13 October. Richmond won easily by 21 points to 5 with Brimble scoring Newton\\'s only try. The try came after Trevor Hall “made a wonderful run to the corner, and from the ensuing scrummage, Brimble barged over in a tackle”. The conversion narrowed the score to 10–5 in Richmond\\'s favour. Richmond however went on to win comfortably. The Auckland Star said that “Brimble and Cameron were a nippy five-eighths pair. Brimble played his best club game to date, but marred some efforts by poor handling”. Brother joins Brimble at Newton and Auckland southern tour. At the conclusion of the 1934 season it was reported that Wilfred Brimble had been granted a transfer from Manukau third intermediate to the Newton seniors. The Herald reported in late April that “the Brimble brothers have shown promising form” in the preseason. They were both named to play in Newton\\'s first match against Richmond on 27 April with Wilfred at halfback. Newton lost 27–15 to the reigning champions with Wilfred said to have given “as clever display as seen on the park for many a day”. While Ted “did some clever things at first five eighth, but his defence was sometimes at fault”. It was also said that “the Brimble brothers were in fine form and repeatedly cut the defence to ribbons. [Wilfred] B.(Bunny) Brimble, the halfback, gave a splendid display. His clean passing and clever running were features of his play. [Ted] E. Brimble five-eighths, proved dangerous on attack”. The following week Newton had a bye with the addition of the Mount Albert United side in the senior grade making seven teams. Newton played a curtain-raiser against the Huntly club from the Waikato at Carlaw Park. Newton won 13–9 with Wilfred converting two tries. On 11 May in a 22–22 draw with Mount Albert, Ted scored a try and was “perhaps the best back”.  Newton outplayed Devonport in round 4, winning 20–5. Wilfred, “behind the Newton scrum, again revealed himself a brilliant half, … his partnership with [Ted] was good to watch, and the five eighth crowned his performance with a try full of merit”. His try came in the second half “when he cut in and left the opposition standing”. Ted scored another try on 1 June against Marist, while Wilfred scored himself and kicked 3 goals. The two of them “constituted the mainspring of attack”. Newton were said to have “owed a lot of its success to the combination of the brothers, Ted at first five-eighths also playing a fine game. The quickness off the mark and accurate handling and passing of the two brothers gave Marist a hard time, and the defence eventually crumpled badly”. During the week the Herald wrote that “the fine combination between him [Wilfred] and his brother [Ted], at first five eighths, was an outstanding feature of the game. Quick off the mark, with always an eye to an opening, the pair set an example which could well be followed by other inside backs in Auckland.Newton then beat City 15–5 in round 7 with it said that “the try scored by Wilfred Brimble was the gem of the match. Six players handled in a fast run the length of the ground and when the defence offered resistance to Ted, his younger brother raced inside to accept a difficult transfer. The crowd showed its appreciation with prolonged applause”. Ted\\'s good form continued in a 15–6 loss to Richmond in round 8 where he was “the most brilliant five-eighths out”. He was prominent again on attack against Mount Albert but Newton suffered a low scoring defeat, 3 points to 0. In round 12 on 13 July against Ponsonby, Newton won 14–13 with a try set up by Ted on full time. He gave Maurice Quirke the final pass for him to score and “played with resource throughout, being on hand when his side needed to be extricated from a tight corner, and always looking for the opening that would bring points. He was perhaps the best back on the ground”. He and Wilfred were “the outstanding players… [with Ted making] several nice openings, which gave the three quarters plenty of opportunities”. The match was the first ever played in Glen Eden, West Auckland at the Glen Eden Recreation round, home of the Glenora Bears rugby league club. Ted scored another try in a 10–7 loss to City but was said to have “spoilt a lot of fine work by selfishness”. The Herald however said that Ted was “easily the best back, and he made several brilliant openings at five-eighths. His try was a fine effort”. In their round 14 match they beat Marist 7–5 to finish 4th in the championship. He “worked well” with Claude Dempsey in the win, “handling the greasy ball in great style”.Ted was then named in the Auckland B side to play South Auckland on 3 August at Carlaw Park. He however ultimately played in the Auckland A side which played Taranaki on the same day in the 3pm kick off. Auckland won the match 37 to 14 though it was said that Ted did not team up well in the five-eighths position with Arthur Kay. Kay played as an individual and scored three solo tries. Ted meanwhile played his “best football in the second half”. Ted was then picked in an Auckland A trial team to play on 17 August to help the selectors find the team to play the touring Australian side. Wilfred was selected in the Auckland B trial team. Ted was teamed with Eric Fletcher in the five eighths positions. Ted\\'s A team won 22–19 with Wilfred scoring one of the B Team\\'s tries.. The following week Ted played for Newton in their round 1 Roope Rooster win over Ōtāhuhu Rovers which they won 27–8. Ted “was the star of Newton, being brilliant in all stages of play” and he scored three of their tries to take his season tally to 7 meaning he finished tied for 7th place in the Auckland club try scoring list. The Herald said he “was easily the best Newton back, and he made some nice openings”.Ted was then chosen in the Auckland side for their 3 match Southern Tour. This meant he missed Newton\\'s Roope Rooster final against Richmond which Newton won 10–8. Both teams were below strength due to having players away for the tour. He played in the first tour match against Wellington on 7 September at Newtown Park in Wellington before a crowd of 3,000. Auckland won a high scoring game 39 to 27 with Brimble scoring one of Auckland\\'s 9 tries. His try came early in the second half to give Auckland a 21–7 lead. The Evening Post said he “was a hard man to stop once in possession” and he and Kay “were responsible for many fine penetrative movements”. Ted played in the next match against West Coast in Greymouth on 11 September at Victoria Park. Auckland won easily by 32 points to 14 before 2,000 spectators. Brimble was involved in several attacking movement but well into the first half he injured his leg and had to go off. Claude Dempsey came on into a reshuffled back-line. Ted was named in the squad to play Canterbury in their next match but was omitted from the final side which had Brian Riley and Arthur Kay as the other five eighth options. During the first half both Jim Laird and Cliff Hall went off injured and Dan Keane and Brimble came on to replace them respectively. Brimble went to five eighth with Brian Riley moved to the wing. He was involved in three attacking movements soon after going on and after the ball flew along the back-line chain he sent Riley in for a try to make the score 23–5 after Cliff Satherley converted. Brimble was hurt again soon after but managed to return to play. Auckland finished the match with a 26–13 win at Monica Park in Christchurch before 3,000 spectators.After Auckland returned from the tour they played a match against the touring Australian team and also an Auckland Province side played the tourists. Brimble was not selected for either match and was possibly still suffering from his injuries from the two tour matches. Auckland Māori and Taranaki XIII selection. The 1936 season saw Ted play 13 matches for Newton. He also played for an Auckland Māori side despite not being of Māori heritage, and for the Taranaki side in a match against the touring England team as one of three Auckland backs brought in to strengthen the side along with Bill Glover and Thomas Trevarthan.. Prior to the start of the 1936 club season, which was beginning earlier than usual due to the touring of the England team later in the year a preview was written of the sides. Of Newton it was said that \"Dempsey is doing well and the nippy combination of Young, the Brimble brothers, Frederick Sissons (a brilliant junior), H. Brady and Schlesinger will be in evidence again\". Newton would struggle somewhat however and only win 2 of their 13 games, finishing last of seven. They opened with losses to Mount Albert and Marist before a 20–16 win over City Rovers on 16 May. Ted and Young found the Mount Albert defence difficult to break through in their opening round loss. However he played very well against Marist, being “the star of the match”. Newton had lost the match 11–0 but Ted was “outstanding on attack, and made several fine openings which went begging owing to lack of support”. His first try of the season was in their win over City. During the match “he showed up with speed and elusiveness in the Newton five-eighth line”. He “played a splendid game at five eighths and often cut the defence to ribbons. He ran straight once a gap was noticed and this gave the three-quarters room to work”. They then beat Devonport 23 to 5. Ted and Wilfred both attacked well in combination and “had a lot to do with Newton’s success”. Ted “stood out prominently on attack and made several beautiful openings. His passing was always well timed and there was an entire absence of selfishness which on occasions has marred his play”. In a 19–14 loss to Richmond Ted and Wilfred “combined well, a feature being their accurate passing and handling. The former was always able to have speed on when accepting a transfer and he made some good openings from which tries should have been scored”. He played well again against Ponsonby along with his brother in a 22–10 loss.Ted was then selected in the Auckland Māori side to play Auckland Pākēha on 23 June. Ted was not Māori but with a Bantu mother he was obviously considered \\'non white\\' enough to qualify for that side. He had also grown up in the Onehunga area which was populated by many Māori from the Onehunga and nearby Māngere areas with many playing both rugby and rugby league for Manukau Rovers rugby, Manukau rugby league, and Māngere United rugby league in the area. His brother Wilfred was also selected in the squad but did not play. The Auckland Māori side, also named Tāmaki, won by 30 points to 21 at Carlaw Park. It was the first time the two sides had ever met. Brimble and Mahima at halfback were both “prominent in fine play”. When the score was 12–8 in their favour Steve Watene finished “off a brilliant opening by Brimble with a try by the posts”. Watene would later go on to become a prominent politician, entering New Zealand Parliament as a Labour Party member. His grandson is Dallin Watene-Zelezniak. Ted had missed two matches for Newton prior to the representative match but returned for their game against Marist on 27 June. They lost 14–12 but his reappearance in combination with Wilfred “gave their backs a touch of distinction”. They both “had splendid games”. They again paired well in a loss to City on 4 July, doing “a lot of good work, especially in the second half” when they “were effective on attack”.Following a match with Richmond, Brimble was then selected to play for Taranaki in their match with England on 4 August at Pukekura Park in New Plymouth. Taranaki were a relatively weak side in the back line and so Brimble, fullback Bill Glover, and Thomas Trevarthan were brought into the side to strengthen it. The Taranaki side were well beaten 35 points to 4 but “Brimble gave a remarkable exhibition as first five-eighths” before a crowd of 3,000. Interestingly at the end of the England tour some of the English players “freely discussed the New Zealand part of the tour” and said that “Haslam was the best three quarter and Brimble the best five eighth” yet neither of them was selected in any of the tests.He finished his season playing in Newton\\'s final round match against Manukau on 29 August, and then a first round Roope Rooster loss to City by 17 points to 15. Ted kicked 1 conversion and 2 penalty goals. It was said that he and Wilfred “never let up”. In the same round their brother Walter switched codes and debuted for the Manukau rugby league senior side. Ted was associated with good play with Fredrick Sissons, and at full time the scores were tied 15–15 necessitating extra time needing to be played. Craddock Dufty a massive New Zealand rugby league personality of the era kicked a penalty in extra time to win the match for City. He missed Newton\\'s final match of the season which was against Marist. 1937 Newton and missed representative selection. The Auckland Star reported on 16 April that Ted was in hospital though they did not say the reason. He missed their 2 preseason games and their first 3 Fox Memorial matches before making his season debut in round 4 against City on 22 May. Newton lost 14–0, with he and Wilfred “prominent for some nice work on attack”. They lost again 14–9 to Richmond at Fowlds Park in Morningside, Mount Albert, though they were “well served by Wilfred and Ted” who “excelled on attack”. All the Brimble brothers played each other for the first time when Newton met Manukau on 5 June at Carlaw Park number 2 field. Manukau won the match 18–11. Ted and Wilfred made a “nice movement” with Young, and Frederick Sissons just missed a try. Walter\\'s form had been good enough to gain selection for Auckland against South Auckland on 9 June. On 31 July in a round 12 match Newton had a rare win, beating North Shore 24–15. Ted scored 2 tries in the victory and “added finish to the attacking movements, and showed his dash of two seasons ago”. On 21 August in a round 13 match Newton beat City 34–19. New Zealand forward Bill McNeight had joined the Newton side. Ted and Hill “teamed well at five-eighths”. The Herald said “the rear division was well served by the Brimble brothers, who gave one of the best exhibitions seen at Carlaw Park this season. The pair were associated in almost every try, and their penetration was a thorn in the side of the opposition”. They “frequently cut the defence to ribbons with a variety of speedy attacks”. In their last round robin game they lost to Richmond 30–9 with Ted and Wilfred being “a lively pair of backs near the scrum”. Ted\\'s last game of the season came in a Roope Rooster round 1 loss to Marist on 4 September. In late September Ted, Wilfred and Walter were all named in the New Zealand Māori squad to play against Auckland on 9 October at Carlaw Park. The match was listed as the Auckland Māori side but in reality was the same as the New Zealand Māori side which beat the touring Australia side earlier. Ultimately only Wilfred of the three brothers played in the match. Newton\\'s improvement and Auckland Māori appearances. In a preseason match with City on 2 April which Newton lost 20–16 the Brimble brothers “paired well in the inside backs”. The 1938 Fox Memorial competition started a week later. Newton improved significantly from their previous two years, winning 10 of their 16 matches to finish third. They lost their second match to Mount Albert, with Ted scoring a try. They “owed much to the Brimble brotherhood… [with] Ted linking well at first five eighth”. In a round 4 match, which Newton won 28–11 at Carlaw Park, Wilfred played brilliantly at half back and Ted “at five eighths, gave his brother excellent support, and his speed often cut out the City five-eighths”. The Auckland Star said that the pair “is showing the best combined play close to the scrum in Auckland”. Wilfred was in spectacular form and said to be the best halfback in Auckland. He was later selected for the New Zealand touring side to Australia along with their other younger brother Walter. In a 34–17 win over Papakura in round 5 Ted scored two tries. The Star said that “brilliant penetrative work by the two Brimbles was a big factor in the clear victory”. Ted “made many nice runs, and his two tries were splendid efforts”. Later in the week the Star wrote that “the real strength of Newton lies in their back play, and particularly the fine understanding that there is between Wilfred Brimble behind the scrum, and his brother, Ted at five eighth. Between them they show both sharpness and penetration, with the result that the men outside them get chances in attack which are up to now denied backs in some of the other teams”. In a 10–9 loss to Ponsonby on 14 May “the brothers E. and W. Brimble were a fine combination, and a clever connecting link with the scrum, the passing of E. Brimble being particularly neat and accurate”. Ted missed selection for the Auckland team to play the Rest of North Island team on 18 May. Both his brothers did however make the side. Walter was picked in the five-eighths position alongside Wally Tittleton. They both played well in a 67–14 thrashing of the Rest of North Island side and were then selected for the North Island side to play the South Island three days later on 21 May. The North Island team won 55–2 and unsurprisingly both of them were then selected for the New Zealand touring side.Ted was selected for the Auckland Māori team to play the Auckland Pākēha side on 6 June. Before the match Ted played in a game for Newton against North Shore which they won 11–10. He played well and “was the best of the Newton backs and made several nice openings”. The Auckland Star suggested that on the performance of Ted in the Māori v Pākēha match that “his play was a feature of the game, and there are many good judges who considered that he should have had a place in the New Zealand team”. Auckland Māori won the match 26–21 though Ted was forced from the field late in the first half with an injury to his leg and was replaced by Mihaka Panapa.Brimble then returned to the Newton side for a 6–2 loss to Marist and then a 5–2 loss to Manukau in round 10. Ted was said to be “outstanding, and made good openings on attack”. They lost again to Mount Albert the following week by 18 to 13. Brimble made “a fine opening and short punted for Taylor to race over” and “was the best of the Newton backs and made clever openings when an opportunity offered. In an easy 16–2 win over Richmond, Brimble scored a try. He was said to be “very nippy on attack, and left the defence standing when he cut through to open the score. He was more closely watched in the second half, but combined well with Fredrick Sissons and Hill in the inside positions”. The “good combination by Brimble and Sissons was a feature of the game. The pair sent out well-directed passes and used their speed once an opening presented itself. The honours of the game go to Brimble, whose first try, after an elusive run, gave the team more confidence and surprised the Richmond backs”. He scored another try in a 13–9 win over City at Carlaw Park. In the 12 July edition of the Auckland Star they published a portrait photograph of Ted and wrote a piece on his non selection in the Auckland team to play the returning New Zealand side which had played 9 matches in Australia. Wilfred had played in 6 of them and Walter in 7. The article said “one is tempted to wonder and regret the non-inclusion of E. Brimble in the Auckland backs, for his penetrative play this season has been on a very high plane. He got a try on Saturday that was the outcome of a remarkable double wide swerve. Had the selectors been standing where the writer was, right at the corner flag, as Brimble cut through, they would have appreciated the way that his opponents were caught on the wrong foot and baffled. Brimble has been paid the compliment of being chosen as a reserve”.On 23 July Newton travelled to Christchurch to play the Canterbury team but Ted did not travel with the side which drew 16–16. Newton then beat Ponsonby 7–3 and Papakura 13–8 in round 16 at Ellerslie Reserve. Ted “was mainly responsible for winning the game. He showed a lot of speed and went through some very narrow openings”. In round 17 Newton defeated North Shore 13–10 to remain in the hunt for the first grade championship. In the first half Ted was involved in some attacking play with his brother and he put D. McKenzie over “for the best try of the game”. The “Brimble brothers were easily the best of the backs and were associated in some clever play round the scrum”. New Zealand international Jack Smith “found the Brimble brothers too fast once the pair settled down”. On 17 August Newton played Canterbury at Carlaw Park in a return match and won 22–12. Wilfred “played a splendid game at half back and received excellent support from E. Brimble, whose speed was most effective on attack”. Three days later Newton played their final round match against the leading side, Marist. If they had won there would have been a three-way tie for first necessitating some kind of playoff however Marist won 10–7 to claim the title by two points from Mount Albert in second and Newton who dropped back to third. Ted had a disappointing game and “mishandled on several occasions and this hampered Sissons, his partner”. The “Brimble brothers did not combine effectively. W. Brimble got the ball away sharply, but things then often went wrong, and in flashes only was E. Brimble the sharp penetrative player whom Newton rely upon to give their attack plenty of thrust”. It was possibly his final match of the season as he did not play in their round 1 Roope Rooster loss to City. He was listed to play in their match with Ponsonby for the Phelan Shield but was not mentioned in the match report in a game they lost 20–15 to finish their season. 1939–40 final seasons with Newton. The 1939 season was a busy one for Ted in the Newton side. He played in 18 matches though surprisingly failed to score a single try for the first time in his career. They were again competitive in the Fox Memorial competition, finishing third with a 9 win, 1 draw, 6 loss record. He didn\\'t play in their season opening game against Marist on 1 April but appeared in their round 2 loss to Mount Albert on 15 April. They began with 4 losses which made the rest of their season more impressive. The first mention of him was in their loss to Ponsonby on 22 April where he “played a good game at five-eighths”. The brothers “teamed well inside” in their loss to City.After 2 more matches for Newton, Ted and Wilfred were both selected for Auckland Māori to play South Auckland at Davies Park in Huntly on 28 May. The Auckland Māori side lost the match but no score was ever reported. The day prior he had played well for Newton in their win over Manukau. The Herald noted that “splendid individual efforts by the Brimble brothers were a feature of the game”. They combined in “brilliant runs” which “resulted in Sander scoring, to place the result beyond doubt” and Ted “at five-eighths, showed some of his best form”. Ted was also chosen to play in the Auckland Māori team to play Auckland Pākēha on 5 June at Carlaw Park but it appears that he did not play with Jackie Rata and Bruce Donaldson chosen in the five eighths on the day. He was also selected to play for the Auckland Māori team again for another match at Huntly against South Auckland in mid June.On 19 June Newton beat Mount Albert 21–7 in round 11. Bert Leatherbarrow, the Mount Albert hooker was not available so Newton won a lot of ball from the scrums and “the Brimble brothers made every use of this advantage and their speed usually resulted in giving the three quarters plenty of room to move”. Wilfred passed magnificently from the scrum and Ted “was also in good form at five-eighths and used his speed to combat the solid play of Banham. In a win over Ponsonby on 24 June the Star wrote that “as usual the Brimble brothers were always in the limelight with Wilfred at halfback sending out long, accurate passes, and E. Brimble at second five-eighth using every opportunity that came his way and giving plenty of openings for his three quarters”. With “perfect understanding by the Brimble brothers [being] a feature of the inside back play”. In a rare recent loss to City in the Newton backs handled well, “especially E. Brimble and Sanders”. Newton then went several matches unbeaten to close out the first grade competition with ted in consistently good form. In the final round they neat Manukau 15–2 on 19 August with the brothers “pairing well” with Ted marking his brother Walter in the Manukau side at five eighth. Ted and Wilfred “stood out as the best players on the ground, smart, well directed passes being a feature of their play”. Ted played in 3 further matches for Newton as they were first eliminated from the Roope Rooster in round 1 by Mt Albert, and then in the Phelan Shield by City after a win over Ponsonby in round 1.. The 1940 season was to be his last as he enlisted in the war effort midway through the season. Ted missed both of Newton\\'s preseason games but debuted in their opening Fox Memorial game against Marist on 20 April which they won 13–10. They won again the following week 11–6 over Richmond with Ted using “the short kick judiciously, placing the ball to the most advantage”. Then in a 4 May, 20–0 win over Ponsonby the Auckland Star wrote “the mainspring of productive team result emanated from Teddy Brimble, that delightful five-eighth, whom many patrons of the game regretted did not earn recognition for the 1938 New Zealand tour of Australia. Mackenzie, Richards and Sanders reacted to his clever tactics”. They beat Papakura easily 28–5 in round 4 with Ted playing “a heady game and did some good tackling”. Ted and Wilfred\\'s brother Walter then joined the Newton side and the three of them played against Mount Albert on 25 May. Newton won 8 to 6 with Walter being “versatile behind the scrum, varying his attack nicely in at attempt to find weakness in the opposing defence. He combined splendidly with Wilfred and Ted, the trio making many determined efforts to break through with straight running”.It was reported in the Auckland Star on 8 June that Ted had enlisted in the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force for the World War 2 effort. In the meantime he continued to play for Newton however in matches against North Shore, Manukau, City, Marist, and Richmond on 13 July. In the match against Richmond and his brothers “were the best of the Newton backs”. War effort. After enlisting in the war effort in early June Ted went to camp at Papakura as part of the Infantry Reinforcements in mid September. He departed for the war sometime during 1941. At the time of his enlistment his address was said to be 61A Wellesley Street West in Auckland city. He was a private in the 29th (Mixed) Battalion in the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force, Third Echelon. His occupation at the time was stated as a machinist. He was later attached to the B Force, 8th Brigade, New Zealand 3rd Division. His brothers Cyril, John, Wilfred, and Lionel all fought in the war also. Walter was also drafted but contested having to go to war. Cyril had moved back to Auckland in 1941 and played a few games for Newton before departing for the war himself. The Auckland Star wrote in April 1941 that “Newton without a Brimble, would not appeal to followers of the red and whites, “Bunny” Brimble [Wilfred\\'s nickname] went into camp at Trentham with representative fullback Claude Dempsey, and both will be missing. However Cyril, the elder of the Brimble brothers, a former Merivale (Christchurch) rugby player, and later of Central league, will fill one of the five eighth positions. In August 1941 the result of a New Zealand army rugby team in Suva was reported with a Brimble scoring a try. It is unclear which of the brothers this could have been. They won the match 32 to 9 against a “representative European team”.On 18 July 1942, it was reported in the New Zealand newspapers that Ted had been wounded in action. The details were not stated and he was part of a list of war casualties that merely showed their names and next of kin which for Ted was his mother, “Mrs J. [Jane] Brimble, Onehunga (mother)”. In August 1942 it was reported that Lionel was missing in the war effort, though he later returned to New Zealand. His next of kin was also listed as their mother Jane, residing in Onehunga. In October 1944 it was reported in the newspapers that Cyril had been wounded. His next of kin was his wife, Mrs. V. W. Brimble of Nelson. In November 1944 it was reported that there had been inter-unit rugby trials involving the Auckland Battalion with Ted one of the players listed as having scored in the matches.Then in April 1945 it was reported that a large contingent of men had returned from “the Mediterranean theatre of war” with Ted\\'s name amongst them. He still had the rank of private. Personal life and death. Ted married Pansy Marguerite Milne Postlewaight in Auckland on 26 October 1929. The marriage notice which was published in the Auckland Star said “Brimble-Postlewaight – On October 26, 1929, by Adjutant Goffin, Edward Pierpont, third son of Mr. and Mrs. H. Brimble, of Onehunga, to Pansy Marguerite, third daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. Postlewaight, of 112, Wellesley Street, Auckland”. They were both aged around 20 at the time of their marriage. Pansy\\'s mother was Chirstina Postlewaight (née Milne). Christina was of European and Māori heritage with a European father and Māori mother.. On 6 February 1940, it was reported in the New Zealand Herald that Pansy, who was then aged 31, had been “sentenced by Mr. Justice Callan in the Supreme Court… on an admitted charge of wilfully making a false declaration under the Marriage Act”. The counsel said “that the offence was most stupid, and showed a lack of responsibility on the part of the accused, who had never been in trouble before”. The judge said Pansy had “passed herself off as a spinster” when “in fact she was only a deserted wife”, “she was prepared to deceive another man, and almost succeeded in deceiving the registrar”. She was admitted probation for two years and ordered to pay £5 in costs towards the prosecution. They had been living apart since 1937. When Ted went enlisted in 1940 his address was listed as 61A Wellesley Street West and his next of kin (Pansy) was listed as 112 Wellesley Street West which was the same address as her parents from 11 years earlier when they had married. Ten years earlier, aged 21 in 1930 Pansy had been caught stealing a pair of stockings from a Karangahape Road shop in September. She pleaded guilty after placing the stockings in her bag and running from the store. When asked of her circumstances by judge, Mr. F.K. Hunt, SM., at the Police Court, Chief Detective Hammond said “she is married and her husband is working. She herself works in a factory and earns £2 10/ weekly”. When asked what she wanted to steal for she gave no answer. The magistrate imposed a fine of £5, or one month\\'s imprisonment, and ordered her to make restitution of 6/11”. On 1 September 1941, Pansy was granted an undefended divorce from Ted. The Auckland Star piece on it said “Pansy Marguerite Milne Brimble (Mr. Schramm [her lawyer]) was granted a decree nisi of divorce from Edward Pierpont Brimble by Mr. Justice Fair in the Supreme Court to-day. Petitioner gave evidence that about seven years after their marriage she had words with her husband about his friendship with another woman. She said he had to choose between them and he said he would stick to the other one, and agreed it was best that he and petitioner should part. That was in 1937, and she had not since lived with him, but had got a magisterial maintenance order”.Ted remarried later to Margaret Thelma Laura Aitkin. She had been born in Foxton in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of the North Island in October 1917.. In 1931 electoral rolls it shows that Ted was living with Pansy at 110 Wellesley Street West and he was a labourer. He lived there throughout the 1930s and was still resident there with the same occupation 10 years later in 1941. Following his return from the war the 1946 electoral records showed Ted was living at 21 Devon Street and was working as a labourer. From at least 1949 until 1954 he was residing at 25 Upper Queen Street and still working as a labourer. By 1957 he was living at 167 Nelson Street and had driver listed as his occupation. In the 1960s he had moved to 31 Bond Street and was again working as a driver.In 1947, on Monday 28 April, Ted\\'s brother Cyril was killed in a fall from a motor lorry. He was aged 48 at the time and died in Hutt Hospital. He had been living on Churton Crescent in Taita. He had been “found unconscious at the corner of Oxford Terrace, Lower Hutt, at 6.30pm on Saturday. He was on his way home, riding alone on the tray of a truck when he apparently fell as the vehicle was rounding a corner. The driver was unaware of the mishap. Brimble was a former Canterbury representative rugby league player, and also played for the Newton club, Auckland. He was married with one child”.Ted Brimble died on 27 June 1968.

      "{'input': ' Indiscriminate and deliberate strikes on civilian targets. According to human rights organisations and to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine was carried out through indiscriminate attacks and strikes on civilian objects such as houses, hospitals, schools and kindergartens.On 25 February, Amnesty International stated that Russian forces had \"shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas\". In addition, Russia has falsely claimed to have only used precision-guided weapons. Amnesty International said on 25 February that the attacks on Vuhledar, Kharkiv and Uman, were likely to constitute war crimes. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said on 26 February that Russia was committing war crimes.A 3 March statement by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the agency had recorded at least 1006 civilian casualties in the first week of the invasion, but that it believed that \"the real figures are considerably higher.\"The World Health Organization released a statement on 6 March saying that it had evidence that multiple health care centres in Ukraine had been attacked, and Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that \"attacks on healthcare facilities or workers breach medical neutrality and are violations of international humanitarian law.\"On 24 March, Amnesty International accused Russia of having repeatedly violated international humanitarian law during the first month of the invasion by conducting indiscriminate attacks, including direct attacks on civilian targets. According to Amnesty International, verified reports and video footage demonstrated numerous strikes on hospitals and schools and the use of inaccurate explosive weapons and banned weapons such as cluster bombs.On 5 July, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet reported that most of the civilian casualties documented by her office had been caused by the Russian army\\'s repeated use of explosive weapons in populated areas. Bachelet said that the heavy civilian toll from the use of such indiscriminate weapons and tactics had by now become \"indisputable\". Use of cluster munitions. Reports on the use of cluster munitions have raised concerns about the heavy toll of immediate civilian casualties and the long-lasting danger of unexploded ordnance. Neither the Russian Federation nor Ukraine ratified the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, but the use of cluster munitions in populated areas may already be deemed incompatible with principles of international humanitarian law prohibiting indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, weapons equipped with cluster munitions have been used both by Russian armed forces and pro-Russian separatists, as well as to a lesser degree by Ukrainian armed forces.On 19 June, The New York Times reported it had reviewed over 1000 photographs of potentially outlawed munitions. It identified photographic evidence of the widespread use of cluster munitions in a wide spectrum of civilian areas. It noted that most were unguided missiles, which have the propensity to cause collateral damage to civilians. It also found cases of other types of weapons whose use might be against international law, such as land mines. Hospitals and medical facilities. As of 26 March, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine verified 74 attacks on medical facilities, 61 of them in Government-controlled territory (e.g. air strikes on hospitals in Izium, Mariupol, Ovruch, Volnovakha and Vuhledar), nine occurring in territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups, and four in contested settlements. Six perinatal centres, maternity hospitals, and ten children\\'s hospitals had been hit, resulting in the complete destruction of two children\\'s hospitals and one perinatal hospital. On 26 March, AP journalists in Ukraine claimed they had gathered sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Russia was deliberately targeting Ukrainian hospitals across the country.On 30 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there had been 82 verified Russian attacks on medical care in Ukraine – including attacks on healthcare facilities, patients, and healthcare workers – since 24 February. WHO estimated at least 72 were killed and 43 injured in these attacks. By 8 April, WHO confirmed 91 attacks. Energy infrastructure. Since October 2022, Russia has increased the intensity of attacks on power stations and other civilian infrastructure in a campaign intended to demoralize the Ukrainian people and threatening to leave millions of civilians without heating or water during winter. As of 20 October 2022, up to 40% of Ukraine\\'s power grid has been attacked by Russia. The government has asked citizens to conserve energy, and rolling blackouts have been introduced.The World Health Organization has warned of a potential humanitarian crisis, saying that \"lack of access to fuel or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life or death if people are unable to heat their homes.\" Denise Brown, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Ukraine, said that the attacks could result in \"a high risk of mortality during the winter months.\"Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that \"attacks targeting civilians and objects indispensable to the survival of civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law\" and \"amount to a war crime.\" The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and 11 members of NATO\\'s eastern flank also called the attacks a war crime.In his comprehensive analysis, Charles J. Dunlap jr., executive director of Duke Law School\\'s Centre on Law, Ethics and National Security and former deputy judge advocate general of the U.S. Air Force, pointed to the view that “[e]lectric power stations are generally recognized to be of sufficient importance to a State’s capacity to meet its wartime needs of communication, transport, and industry so as usually to qualify as military objectives during armed conflicts”, furthermore that they have been a favourite target for almost a century, and that Ukraine did resort to similar tactics in 2015.Military structures, too, typically rely on the civilian electrical grid. Also, attacks on civilian enterprises may be justified due to the Ukraine\\'s \"sizeable domestic military-industrial complex\" and due to energy exports (also in the form of electricity) being one of Ukraine\\'s main revenue sources. The distinction between military and civilian targets is still relevant but does however not preclude attacks on dual-use (military and civilian) facilities if it is not \"reasonably feasible to segregate [civilian portions] out from the overall strike\" - as it may be the case with Ukraine\\'s \"thoroughly integrated\" electrical grid. The blurring of citizen and combatant, e.g. by calling upon citizens to report enemy positions via government apps, further complicates the picture.Similarly, proportionality of military advantage and civilian harm must be maintained but may be seen as adequate in this case, with about 70 civilian deaths (as of his writing) vs. 40% of the national grid knocked out. When evaluating the consequences, harm to civilians is understood by the US DoD as \"immediate or direct harms\". On the other hand, taking into account \"remote harms\" like the possible starvation or freezing of Ukrainian citizens in the following weeks or months is disputed, esp. as large parts of the grid have been restored quickly so far and as the Ukraine, too, is obliged to protect its citizens from extreme cold, regardless of the actions of the attacker. Finally, while explicit terror attacks are prohibited under international law, the disaggregation of justified military advantages and a psychological impact upon civilians is often hardly feasible. The US view is that \"attacks that are otherwise lawful are not rendered unlawful if they happen to result in diminished morale.\" Nuclear power plants. At 11:28 pm local time on 3 March 2022, a column of 10 Russian armored vehicles and two tanks cautiously approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\\'s largest. The action commenced at 12:48am on 4 March when Ukraine forces fired anti-tank missiles and Russian forces responded with a variety of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades. During approximately two hours of heavy fighting a fire broke out in a training facility outside the main complex, which was extinguished by 6:20am, though other sections surrounding the plant sustained damage. That evening, the Kyiv US Embassy described the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as a war crime, though the US State Department quickly retracted this claim with the circumstances of the attack being studied and the Pentagon declining to describe the attack as a war crime.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of committing \"nuclear terror\" by ordering the attack on the plant and Ukraine regulatory authorities stated that Russian forces fired artillery shells at the plant, setting fire to the training facility. The Russian Ambassador to the UN responded that Russian forces were fired upon by Ukrainian \"saboteurs\" from the training facility, which they set fire to when they left. Later on 4 March, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that the plant\\'s safety systems had not been affected and there had been no release of radioactive materials, however, he was \"... gravely concerned about the situation at Ukraine\\'s largest nuclear power plant. The main priority was to ensure the safety and security of the plant, its power supply and the people who operate it\".Attacks on nuclear power facilities are mainly governed by Article 56 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, which generally prohibits attacks against civilian nuclear power plants. According to international scholars: \"if it is established that Russian forces engaged in the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant or objectives in its vicinity in a way that risked a radioactive leak, it is almost certain that this operation violated Article 56\" but it is \"less likely\" that Russian forces have committed a war crime in this case.On 13 April, a report of the OSCE Moscow Mechanism\\'s mission of experts concluded that Russian forces \"did not attack buildings that could have released dangerous forces if damaged. They attacked and damaged, however, nearby buildings by attacks that could have affected those able to release radioactivity.\" Cultural heritage. The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects has raised concerns about the proximity of historic monuments, works of art, churches and other cultural properties. Russian forces damaged or destroyed the Kuindzhi Art Museum in Mariupol, the Soviet-era Shchors cinema and a Gothic revival library in Chernihiv, the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial complex in Kyiv, the Soviet-era Slovo building and the regional state administration building in Kharkiv, a 19th-century wooden church in Viazivka, Zhytomyr Region, and the Historical and Local History Museum in Ivankiv. On 24 June, UNESCO stated that at least 150 Ukrainian historical sites, religious buildings, and museums were confirmed to have sustained damage during the Russian invasion.Cultural property enjoys special protection under international humanitarian law. Protocol I of the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (both binding on Ukraine and Russia) prohibits state parties from targeting historic monuments in support of a military effort and from making them the objects of acts of hostility or reprisals. Protocol II of the Hague Convention allows attacks on a cultural property only in case of \"imperative military necessity\" provided that there is no feasible alternative. While Protocol II does not apply as such, as only Ukraine is a party and it applies only between parties, the provision on imperative military necessity may be applicable if it is interpreted as informing the convention, rather than adding to it.

After the successful Kharkiv counteroffensive by Ukraine which liberated a number of settlements and villages in the Kharkiv region from Russian occupation, authorities discovered torture chambers which had been used by Russian troops during their time in control of the area.. In the town of Balakliya, which the Russians occupied for six months, forensics specialists, human rights activists, criminal law experts, and Ukrainian investigators found extensive evidence of war crimes and torture. During the Russian occupation, the troops used a two-story building named \"BalDruk\" (after a former publishing company which had an office there before the war) as a prison and a torture center. The Russians also used the police station building across the street for torture. Ukrainian officials say that around 40 people were held in the torture chambers during the occupation and subject to various forms of violence, including electrocution, beatings and mutilation. Two torture chambers specifically for children were also found in the city, one of the kids who had been held there described being cut with a knife, burnt with heated metal and subjected to mock executions.Another Russian torture chamber was found in the liberated village of Kozacha Lopan, located at the local railway station.

Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\\'s Office stated that \"Representatives of the Russian Federation created a pseudo-law enforcement agency, in the basement of which a torture chamber was set up, where civilians were subjected to inhumane torture.\" Ukrainian prosecutors have opened investigations into Russia\\'s use of torture chambers.In Izium, journalists for the Associated Press found ten torture sites. An investigation found that both Ukrainian civilians and POWs were \"routinely\" subject to torture. At least eight men were killed while under torture.Between late September and early October, Human Rights Watch interviewed over 100 residents of Izium. Almost all of them reported having family members or friends who had been tortured, and fifteen people said they had been tortured themselves; survivors described torture by administration of electric shocks, waterboarding, severe beatings, threats with firearms and being forced to hold stress positions for long periods. Residents stated that the Russians targeted specific individuals and that they already had lists of those locals who were in the military, the families of military people, or the people who were veterans of the war in Donbas. They also said that in selecting victims they would terrorize the townspeople by publicly strip searching them.By October, no less than 10 torture sites had been identified in the town of approximately 46,000 inhabitants. Zaporizhzhia region. In July 2022, The Guardian reported on torture chambers in the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region based on the testimony of a 16-year-old boy who was held in one of them, beginning in April. The boy was arrested by Russian soldiers while trying to leave the occupied city of Melitopol because he had a video on his phone from social media, which featured Russian soldiers expressing defeatist attitudes towards Russia\\'s invasion. He was held in a make shift prison in Vasylivka. According to his testimony, he saw rooms where torture took place, as well as bloodstains and soaked bandages, and heard the screams of the people being tortured.

According to Human Rights Watch, both Russian and Ukrainian armies have based their forces in populated areas without first evacuating the residents, thus exposing them to unnecessary risks. On 29 June, also the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about Russian armed forces and pro-Russian armed groups as well as Ukrainian forces taking up positions close to civilian objects without taking measures for protecting the civilians. The human rights agency received reports of the use of human shields, which involves the deliberate use of civilians to render certain military objectives immune from attack.ABC News and The Economist reported Russian soldiers using over 300 Ukrainian civilians as human shields in Yahidne from 3 to 31 March. Russian forces were using the village as a base to attack the nearby city of Chernihiv and had established a major military camp in the local school. For 28 days, 360 Ukrainian civilians, including 74 children and 5 persons with disabilities, were held captive in inhumane conditions in the basement of the school while the nearby areas were under attack by the Ukrainian forces. The basement was overcrowded, with no toilet facilities, water and ventilation. Ten elderly people died as a consequence of the poor detention conditions. Witness accounts report cases of torture and killings. According to the OHCHR what happened in the school of Yahidne suggests that the Russian armed forces were using civilians to render their base immune from military attacks while also subjecting them to inhuman and degrading treatment.The BBC and The Guardian found \"clear evidence\" of the use of Ukrainian civilians as human shields by Russian troops in the area near Kyiv after the Russian withdrawal on 1 April, citing eyewitness accounts from inhabitants of Bucha and the nearby village of Ivankiv, and of residents of the village of Obukhovychi, near the Belarusian border, Russian troops were accused of using civilians as human shields as they came under attack by Ukrainian soldiers. Multiple witnesses reported that, on 14 March, the Russian soldiers went door-to-door, rounded about 150 civilians and locked them up in the local school, where they were used as protection for the Russian forces.United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stated that it had received reports of disabled people being used as \"human shields\" by Russian armed forces.United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that Russia\\'s use of nuclear power plants for active military operations as tantamount to the use of human shields, citing reports that Russian forces were firing on Ukrainians from nuclear sites.Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of using human shields, a claim which has been rejected by scholars Michael N. Schmitt, Neve Gordon, and Nicola Perugini as an attempt to shift blame for civilian deaths to Ukraine. Sexual violence. According to experts and Ukrainian officials, there are indications that sexual violence was tolerated by the Russian command and used in a systematic way as a weapon of war. After the Russian withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv, there was a \"mounting body of evidence\" of rape, torture and summary killings by Russian forces inflicted upon Ukrainian civilians, including gang rapes committed at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children.In March 2022 the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine stressed the heightened risks of sexual violence and the risk of under-reporting by victims in the country. At the beginning of June, the Monitoring Mission received reports of 124 episodes of conflict-related sexual violence committed against women, girls, men and boys in various Ukrainian cities and regions. The alleged perpetrators were from the ranks of Russian and pro-Russian separatist armed forces in 89 cases and from civilians or unidentified individuals in territory controlled by Russian armed forces in 2 cases.In late March Ukraine\\'s Prosecutor General opened an investigation into a case of a Russian soldier who was accused of killing an unarmed civilian and then repeatedly raping the dead man\\'s wife. The incident allegedly took place on 9 March in Shevchenkove, a village outside of Kyiv. The wife related that two Russian soldiers raped her repeatedly after killing her husband and the family\\'s dog while her four-year-old son hid in the house\\'s boiler room. The account was first published by The Times of London. Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegation as a lie. Ukrainian authorities have said that numerous reports of sexual assault and rape by Russian troops have emerged since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian MP Maria Mezentseva said that these types of cases were underreported and that there are many other victims. Meduza published an in-depth account of the same case in Bogdanivka and of other events.In another reported incident, a Russian soldier entered a school in the village of Mala Rohan where civilians were sheltering and raped a young Ukrainian woman. Human Rights Watch reported that the woman was threatened and repeatedly raped by a Russian soldier who cut her cheek, neck and hair. According to witness statements, the villagers informed Russian officers in charge of the occupation of the village of the incident, who arrested the perpetrator and told them that he would be summarily executed. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba stated that Russian soldiers had committed \"numerous\" rapes against Ukrainian women. According to the Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict database, sexual violence by Russian forces has been reported in three of seven years of conflict since 2014 in eastern Ukraine.A report published by The Kyiv Independent included a photo and information about one man and two or three naked women under a blanket whose bodies Russian soldiers tried to burn on the side of a road before fleeing. Ukrainian officials said the women had been raped and the bodies burnt. Human Rights Watch received reports of other incidents of rape in Chernihiv region and Mariupol. ABC News reported in April 2022 that \"rapes, shootings and a senseless execution\" have occurred in the village of Berestyanka near Kyiv, noting a specific incident where a man was reportedly shot by Russian soldiers on 9 March after attempting to block them from raping his wife and a female friend.On 12 April 2022, BBC News interviewed a 50-year-old woman from a village 70 km west of Kyiv, who said that she was raped at gunpoint by a Chechen allied with the Russian Armed Forces. A 40-year-old woman was raped and killed by the same soldier, according to neighbours, leaving what BBC News described as a \"disturbing crime scene\". Police exhumed the 40-year-old\\'s body the day after the visit by BBC News. A report by The New York Times related that a Ukrainian woman was kidnapped by Russian soldiers, kept in a cellar as a sex slave and then executed. On 3 June, the United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, told the U.N. Security Council that dozens of violent sexual attacks against women and girls have been reported to the U.N. human rights office, and many more cases likely have not been reported. She also said the country is turning into “a human trafficking crisis.”As of 5 July 2022, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had verified 28 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, gang rape, torture, forced public stripping, and threats of sexual violence. OHCHR reported that 11 cases, including rape and gang rape, were committed by Russian armed forces and law enforcement. In addition, due to the limited communication, especially with areas under Russian or separatist control (such as Mariupol) and contested cities, a major barrier to verification of cases remain access, the exact number of sexual violence cases have been difficult to track or respond to in a timely manner. Reports of sexual violence have been reported to Ukrainian and international authorities, law enforcement officials and media personnel as Russian troops have withdrawn.A 52-year-old woman was taken by Russian soldiers in occupied Izyum and repeatedly raped while her husband was beaten. She, along with her husband, was arrested on 1 July and was taken to a small shed which served as a torture room. The Russian soldiers put bags over their heads and threatened them, afterwards, they forcibly undressed her, groped her, and told her that they would send photos of the activity to her family members to humiliate her and them. The woman was then raped repeatedly by the commander of the unit for the next three days, while simultaneously the other Russian soldiers beat her husband in a nearby garage. The rapist would then describe the assault to the husband. She attempted suicide by hanging, but failed. Subsequently, the Russian soldiers tortured her with electric shocks and humiliated her. The Russian commander also obtained the woman\\'s bank number and stole the funds out of her account. The woman and her husband were released on 10 July when they were dumped blindfolded by the Russians at a nearby gas station. They managed to escape to Ukrainian territory, and, after Izyum was liberated in September, returned home.In late September 2022, a panel of investigators from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine released a statement which said that the commission has \"documented cases in which children have been raped, tortured, and unlawfully confined.\" and labeled these as war crimes. The same report also referenced children being killed and injured by Russia\\'s indiscriminate attacks as well as forced separation from family and kidnapping.Doctors at a maternity clinic in Poltava reported cases of women who had been raped by Russian soldiers and then had window sealant injected into their sexual organs so that they could never have children. Abduction and deportation. According to Ukrainian officials and two witnesses, Russian forces have forcefully deported thousands of residents from Ukraine to Russia during the Siege of Mariupol. On 24 March, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the Russian army had forcibly deported about 6,000 Mariupol residents in order to use them as \"hostages\" and put more pressure on Ukraine. According to the Russian ministry of defense the residents of Mariupol had a \"voluntary choice\" whether to evacuate to the Ukrainian- or Russian-controlled territory and that by 20 March about 60,000 Mariupol residents were \"evacuated to Russia\". Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify these accounts.The US embassy in Kyiv cited the Ukrainian foreign ministry as claiming that 2,389 Ukrainian children had been illegally removed from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and taken to Russia.On 24 March, Ukraine\\'s human rights ombudsman said that over 402,000 Ukrainians had been forcefully taken to Russia, including around 84,000 children. Russian authorities said that more than 384,000 people, including over 80,000 children, had been evacuated to Russia from Ukraine and from the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.Deportation of protected peoples such as civilians during war is prohibited by Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. On 7 June, Human Rights Watch specialist Tanya Lokshina emphasized this point, reiterating that that forcible deportation against people\\'s will was itself a war crime, and called Russia to stop this practice. In addition, Human Rights Watch and Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group reported cases where refugees were being intimidated and pressured to implicate Armed Forces of Ukraine personnel for war crimes during long interrogation sessions, including the Mariupol theatre airstrike. Arbitrary detention and forced disappearance. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine confirmed that in the first month of the invasion they had documented the arbitrary detention in Russian occupied territories of 21 journalists and civil society activists, nine of whom had already reportedly been released. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission also verified the arrests and detention of 24 public officials and civil servants of local authorities, including three mayors, by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups of the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk.International humanitarian law allows the internment of civilians in armed conflict only when they individually pose a security threat, and all detained persons whose prisoners of war (PoW) status is in doubt must be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention until their status has been determined. Reports of missing civilians are rampant in villages to the west of Kyiv, as Russian troops have withdrawn in the area, with a large majority of them male. One woman in Makhariv told reporters she witnessed Russian soldiers force her son-in-law at gunpoint to drive away from their house with the troops and he has not been seen since. Another man disappeared in Shptky, while attempting to deliver petrol to a friend with only his burned out and bullet-ridden car found later by Ukrainian troops.On 5 July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights documented 270 cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of civilians, eight of whom were found dead. The OHCHR informed the Human Rights Council that arbitrary detention of civilians had become \"widespread\" in territory controlled by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups. OHCHR also reported that since the beginning of the invasion the Security Service of Ukraine and National Police had arrested over one thousand pro-Russian supporters, and that 12 cases were likely to amount to enforced disappearance by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies.As of 15 May 62 victims (44 men and 18 women) of enforced disappearance had been released by Russian and Russian-affiliated armed groups. On most occasions the victims were released during \"exchanges of prisoners\" between Russia and Ukraine. According to the OHCHR, such exchanges might constitute cases of hostage taking, which in armed conflict amounts to a war crime, if the liberation of detained civilians had been made conditional by the Russian forces on the release by Ukraine of Russian prisoners of war. Filtration camps. Evacuees from Mariupol raised concerns about the treatment of evacuees from Mariupol by Russian troops through a Russian filtration camp, that is reportedly used to house civilians before they were evacuated. Similar camps have been compared by Ukrainian officials to \"modern-day concentration camps\". Refugees have reported torture and killings when being processed through filtration camps, especially in Mariupol. These include beatings, electrocution and suffocating people with plastic bags over their heads.The refugees were fingerprinted, photographed from all sides, and had their phones searched, and anyone believed to be a \"Ukrainian Nazi\" was taken to Donetsk for interrogation. They also told reporters there was a lack of basic necessities and a majority of the evacuations forced refugees into Russia.On 5 July the OHCHR expressed concern about the whereabouts and treatment of those who had not passed the filtration process, who were possibly detained in unknown locations at high risk of being subjected to torture and ill-treatment. Abduction of Ukrainian children. According to Ukrainian authorities, Russian forces have also kidnapped more than 121,000 Ukrainian children and deported them to Russia\\'s eastern provinces. The parents of some of these children were killed by the Russian military. The Russian state Duma has drafted a law which would formalize the \"adoption\" of these children. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that there was a \"blatant threat of illegal adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian citizens without observing all the necessary procedures determined by the legislation of Ukraine.” and called on United Nations bodies to intervene to have the children returned to Ukraine.On 1 June 2022, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russia of forcibly deporting more than 200,000 children from Ukraine, including orphans and children separated from their family. According to Zelenskyy, this amounts to a \"heinous war crime\" and a \"criminal policy,\" whose object \"is not just to steal people but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return.\" Forced conscription. At the end of February, Ukrainian civilians were reportedly forced to join the pro-Russian separatist forces in the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk people\\'s republics. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights documented cases of people forcefully taken to assembly points where they were recruited and immediately sent to the front line. They were men working in the public sector, including schools, and also people stopped on the street by representatives of local \"commissariats\". As recalled by the OHCHR, compelling civilians to serve in armed groups affiliated with a hostile power may constitute a serious breach of the laws and customs of international humanitarian law, and it constitutes a war crime under Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the ICC. The OHCHR also expressed concern about the case of some forced conscripts who have been prosecuted by Ukrainian authorities notwithstanding their combatant immunity under the law of armed conflict. Mistreatment of prisoners of war. As of November 2022, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) conducted 159 interviews with prisoners of war held by the Russian and Russian-affiliated forces, and 175 interviews with prisoners of war held by Ukraine. The vast majority of Ukrainian prisoners reported that they had been held in dire conditions of internment and subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including beatings, threats, mock executions, electric and positional torture. Several women prisoners were threatened with sexual violence and subjected to degrading treatments and enforced nudity. The UN agency also collected information about nine possible cases of death during the \"admission procedures\" to the internment camps. According to HRMMU report, Russian prisoners of war made credible allegations of summary executions, torture and ill-treatment by members of the Ukrainian forces. In several cases Russian prisoners were stabbed and subjected to electric torture. Ukraine launched criminal investigations into allegations of mistreatment of prisoners of war. Russian POWs. As of 31 July 2022, OHCHR documented 50 cases of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war in the power of Ukraine, including cases of beating, shooting, stabbing, positional and electric torture. One prisoner of war was reportedly suffocated by Ukrainian policemen of the  Kharkiv SBU during his interrogation. Torture of Russian POWs in Mala Rohan. According to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), members of Ukrainian armed forces shot the legs of three captured Russian soldiers and tortured Russian soldiers who were wounded. The incident is likely to have occurred on the evening of 25 March in Mala Rohan, south-east of Kharkiv, in an area recently recaptured by Ukrainian troops, and was first reported following the publication on social media accounts of a video of unknown authorship between 27 and 28 March. One of the video\\'s versions depicts a number of soldiers lying on the ground; many appear to be bleeding from leg wounds. Three prisoners are brought out of a vehicle and shot in the leg  by someone off-camera. Alleged execution of captured Russian soldiers. On 6 April a video allegedly showing Ukrainian troops of the Georgian Legion executing captured Russian soldiers was posted on Telegram. The video was verified by The New York Times and by Reuters. A wounded Russian soldier was seemingly shot twice by a Ukrainian soldier while lying on the ground. Three dead Russian soldiers, including one with a head wound and hands tied behind his back, were shown near the soldier. The video appeared to have been filmed on a road north of the village of Dmytrivka, seven miles south of Bucha. Ukrainian authorities promised an investigation. Disputed surrender of Russian soldiers in Makiivka. On 12 November, a video appeared on pro-Ukrainian websites showing the bodies of soldiers in Russian uniforms lying on the ground in a farmyard in the Makiivka area. On 17 November, more footage emerged, taken from the ground by a person at the scene. The video shows the Russian soldiers as they exit a building, surrender, and lay face down on the ground. Then another Russian soldier emerges from the same building and opens fire on the Ukrainian soldiers who are surprised. An aerial video from the site documents the aftermath, with at least 12 bodies of Russian soldiers, most positioned as they were when they surrendered, bleeding from gunshot wounds to the head.The authenticity of the videos was verified by The New York Times. Russia and Ukraine accused each other of war crimes, with Russia accusing Ukraine of \"mercilessly shooting unarmed Russian P.O.W.s,\" and Ukraine accusing the Russians of opening fire while surrendering. Ukraine\\'s officials said the Prosecutor General’s office would investigate the video footage as the incident may qualify as a crime of  \"perfidy\" committed by the Russian troops in feigning surrender. On 25 November the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said \"Our Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has conducted a preliminary analysis indicating that these disturbing videos are highly likely to be authentic in what they show\" and called on the Ukrainian authorities to investigate the allegations of summary executions of Russian prisoners of war \"in a manner that is – and is seen to be – independent, impartial, thorough, transparent, prompt and effective.\" Ukrainian POWs. As of 31 July 2022, OHCHR verified that, out of 35 interviewed, 27 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been subjected to torture by Russian and pro-Russian armed forces and policemen. Victims reported being punched, kicked, beaten with police batons and wooden hammers, electrocuted, threatened with execution or sexual violence, and shot in the legs. OHCHR had also received information about the deaths of two Ukrainian prisoners as a result of torture, one beaten and electrocuted on 9 May at the Melitopol airfield, the other beat to death at the Volnovakha penal colony near Olenivka, Donetsk region, on 17 April. Execution of surrendering Ukrainian soldiers. At an Arria-formula meeting of the UN Security Council, the US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice Beth Van Schaack said that US authorities have evidence that surrendering Ukrainian soldiers were executed by the Russian army in Donetsk. A Ukrainian soldier who was shown among prisoners in a Russian video on 20 April, was confirmed dead days later.Eyewitness accounts and a video filmed by a security camera provide evidence that on 4 March Russian paratroopers executed at least eight Ukrainian prisoners of war in Bucha. The victims were local inhabitants who had joined the defense forces shortly before they were killed. Torture and castration of Ukrainian prisoners. In June of 2023 The Times reported on two former Ukrainian soldiers who had been tortured by Russians while in captivity and castrated with a knife, before being freed in a prisoner of war swap. A psychologist who was treating the men reported that she had heard of many other similar cases from her colleagues. Death sentence against foreign soldiers serving in the Ukrainian armed forces. Following a trial by the Supreme Court of the Donetsk People\\'s Republic, three foreign-born members of the Ukrainian armed forces, Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner, and Brahim Saadoun were declared mercenaries and sentenced to execution by firing squad. Aslin and Pinner, originally from England, had been serving in the Ukrainian military since 2018, while Saadoun had come in 2019 from Morocco to study in Kyiv, having enlisted in November 2021. The ruling was described as illegal because the defendants qualify as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions and have not been accused of committing any war crimes.On 10 June the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the death sentences and the trial. A spokesperson of the organisation declared that \"such trials against prisoners of war amount to a war crime,\" and highlighted that according to the chief command of Ukraine, all the defendants were part of the Ukrainian armed forces and therefore should not have been considered mercenaries. The OHCHR spokesperson also expressed concern about procedural fairness, stating that \"since 2015, we have observed that the so-called judiciary within these self-contained republics has not complied with essential fair trial guarantees, such as public hearings, independence, impartiality of the courts and the right not to be compelled to testify.\"The International Bar Association issued a statement saying \"that any implementation of the ‘pronounced’ death penalty will be an obvious case of plain murder of Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Brahim Saaudun and deemed an international war crime. Any perpetrators (anyone engaged in the so-called DPR ‘court’ and anyone who conspired to execute this decision) will be regarded as war criminals\", also pointing out that neither Russian nor Ukrainian law allows the death penalty.On 12 June, Donetsk People\\'s Republic leader Denis Pushilin reiterated that the separatists did not see the trio as prisoners of war, but rather as people who came to Ukraine to kill civilians for money, adding that he saw no reason to modify or mitigate the sentences. Russian State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin accused the trio of fascism, reiterating that they deserved the death penalty. He added that the Ukrainian armed forces were committing crimes against humanity and were being controlled by a neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv.On 17 June, the European Court of Human Rights issued an emergency stay of Saadoun Brahim\\'s execution. It stressed that Russia was still obliged to follow the court\\'s rulings. Earlier in June, the Russian State Duma passed a law to end the jurisdiction of the court in Russia, but it had not yet been signed into law.On 8 July the DPR lifted a moratorium on the death penalty. On 21 September five British citizens held by pro-Russian separatists were released, including those sentenced to death, and also the Moroccan citizen Saadoun Brahim was freed after a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia. Execution of Oleksandr Matsievskyi. In early March a video emerged showing the execution of an unarmed Ukrainian POW who is murdered after he says \"Glory to Ukraine\", while smoking a cigarette. The Russian officer in charge of the prisoner (off camera) shouts \"Die Bitch!\" and fires multiple rounds from a machine gun into him. The President of Ukraine\\'s office called the execution a \"brutal murder\". Torture of captured Ukrainian soldiers. On 22 July, Human Rights Watch documented the torture of three Ukrainian prisoners of war, members of the Territorial Defense Forces, and the death of two of them in the occupied areas of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. Castration and murder of a Ukrainian POW in Pryvillia. On 28 July, a video was posted on Russian social media which shows a Russian soldier castrating a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who is tied up and gagged, with a box cutter. On the next day, a continuation video was posted with possibly the same soldiers where they taped the POW\\'s mouth with black tape, placed his head in front of his cut genitals, and shot him in the head. After that, the Russian soldiers started grabbing the POW\\'s corpse with ropes connected to his legs.On 5 August, the Bellingcat group reported that the videos were geolocated to the Pryvillia Sanatorium, located in Pryvillia, Luhansk Oblast, and interviewed the apparent perpetrator by telephone. A white car marked with a Z – a designation marking Russian military vehicles and a militarist symbol used in Russian propaganda – can also be seen in the video; the same car can also be seen in earlier, official videos released by Russian channels, of the Akhmat fighters at the Azot plant during the Russian capture of Sieverodonetsk. Pryvillia had been captured and occupied by Russians since early July. Bellingcat identified the soldiers involved, including the main perpetrator (an inhabitant of Tuva), who wore a distinctive wide brimmed black hat, as members of the Akhmat unit, a Chechen Kadyrovite paramilitary formation fighting for the Russians in the war in Ukraine. The investigation also indicated that the video contained no evidence of tampering or editing. Beheading and mutilations. In April 2023, two videos surfaced which appeared to show beheaded and mutilated Ukrainian soldiers. One video purportedly filmed by Wagner Group mercenaries showed the bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed military vehicle, their heads and hands missing, with a voice commenting in Russian in the background. The second video appeared to show Russian soldiers decapitating a Ukrainian prisoner of war using a knife. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said that “Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident.” Looting. Looting is a war crime under several treaties. Survivors of the Bucha massacre, talking to Human Rights Watch (HRW) following the retreat of the Russian forces, described the treatment of people in the city during the occupation: Russian soldiers went door to door, questioning people and destroying their possessions. They also said that Russian soldiers looted the town, and took clothing, jewelry, electronics, kitchen appliances and vehicles of evacuees, the deceased, and those still in the city. Wall Street Journal journalist Yaroslav Trofimov reported hearing of Russian soldiers looting food and valuables during his visit to southern Ukraine. The Guardian journalists visiting Trostianets after a month-long Russian occupation found evidence of \"systematic looting\". Similarly, villagers in Berestyanka near Kyiv told ABC News that before the village returned to Ukrainian control, Russian soldiers looted clothes, household appliances and electronics from homes.Videos have been posted on Telegram, reportedly showing Russian soldiers sending stolen Ukrainian goods home through courier services in Belarus. Items visible in videos included air conditioning units, alcohol, car batteries, and bags from Epicentr K stores. News aggregator Ukraine Alert posted video showing stolen goods found in an abandoned Russian armored personnel carrier, and an image reportedly showing a damaged Russian military truck carrying three washing machines. Intercepted telephone calls have also made mention of looting; a call by a Russian soldier released by the Security Service of Ukraine included the soldier telling his girlfriend: \"I stole some cosmetics for you\" to which the girlfriend responded \"What Russian person doesn\\'t steal anything?\" The Russian company CDEK postal service stopped live streaming its CCTV in early April. CDEK live-streams video from its delivery offices as a courtesy to customers to show them how busy the offices are, before customers visit the branches. This live stream was used by Lithuania-based exiled Belarusian dissident Anton Motolko as evidence of looting. Some of the items came from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and were radioactive or contaminated with radioactivity.There were reports of bazaars set up by Russian forces in Belarus to trade in looted goods, such items as \"washing machines and dishwashers, refrigerators, jewelry, cars, bicycles, motorcycles, dishes, carpets, works of art, children\\'s toys, cosmetics\". Russian soldiers sought payment in euros and US dollars, however, and due to currency restrictions this was difficult for locals.Widespread claims of looting and other damage by Russian troops to cultural institutions were raised by Ukrainian officials with a majority of the accusations coming from the areas of Mariupol and Melitopol. Ukrainian officials claimed that Russian forces seized more than 2,000 artworks and Scythian gold from various museums and moved them into the Donbas region. Experts in Ukraine and elsewhere who track Russian looting and destruction of cultural heritage in Ukraine cite evidence that state-sponsored and systematic conducted by specialists began with the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Genocide. Several national parliaments, including those of Ukraine as well as Canada, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Ireland declared that the war crimes taking place in the invasion were genocide. Scholars of genocide, including Eugene Finkel, Timothy D. Snyder, Norman M. Naimark and Gregory Stanton, and legal experts Otto Luchterhandt and Zakhar Tropin said that along with the acts required by the definition of genocide, there was genocidal intent, together establishing genocide. Human rights lawyer Juan E. Méndez stated on 4 March 2022 that the genocide claim was worth investigating, but should not be presumed; and genocide scholar Alexander Hinton stated on 13 April that Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s genocidal rhetoric would have to be linked to the war crimes in order to establish genocidal intent.A report by 30 genocide and legal scholars concluded that the Russian state is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, that it has committed acts prohibited by the Genocide Convention, that a serious risk of genocide being committed exists, and that this triggers the obligation of state parties to the convention to take action to prevent genocide. National legal proceedings. Ukraine. The Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba stated on 25 February that Russia was committing war crimes, and that the ministry and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine were collecting evidence on events including attacks on kindergartens and orphanages, which would be \"immediately transfer[red]\" to the ICC. On 30 March, Ukraine\\'s chief prosecutor announced that she was building 2,500 war crimes cases against the Russian invasion. On 13 May the first war crimes trial began in Kyiv, of a Russian soldier who was ordered to shoot an unarmed civilian. The soldier, Vadim Shishimarin, soon pleaded guilty to this crime. Shortly after Shishimarin pleaded guilty, two other low-ranked Russian soldiers, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, were tried on war crimes charges for firing missiles at a residential tower block in Kharkiv. They also pleaded guilty.Several international legal teams were formed to support the Ukrainian prosecutors.. EU Joint Investigation TeamIn the aftermath of the Bucha massacre, the EU established a Joint Investigation Team with Ukraine to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity. Within the framework of the Joint Investigation Team, a pool of investigators and legal experts by Eurojust and Europol is made available for providing assistance to Ukrainian prosecutors. On 6 April 2022, United States Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the U.S. Department of Justice was assisting Eurojust and Europol prosecutors with their investigation, and that the Justice and State Departments were also making efforts to support the Ukrainian prosecutor.. Task Force on Accountability for Crimes Committed in Ukraine. In late March 2022, the Task Force on Accountability for Crimes Committed in Ukraine, a pro bono international group of lawyers, was created to help Ukrainian prosecutors coordinate legal cases for war crimes and other crimes related to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.. Atrocity Crimes Advisory GroupOn 25 May 2022, the EU, US, and the UK announced the creation of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA) to help coordinate their investigations and to support the War Crimes Units of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine (OPG). Other countries. Several states, including Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden, announced in March and April 2022 that they would conduct investigations of war crimes in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine under the universal jurisdiction principle of international humanitarian law. International legal proceedings. International courts that have jurisdiction over cases originating from the Russian invasion of Ukraine include the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.Because of the backload of cases in Ukrainian courts, which as of June 2022 have more than 15,000 pending cases, and the number of international bodies and foreign countries cooperating in the investigations of war crimes in Ukraine, there were calls to create a special hybrid court to centralize domestic and international efforts. In May, the idea of establishing a special international tribunal was formally endorsed by a group of members of the European Parliament. The establishment of a special tribunal within the framework of the United Nations could be hampered by Russia\\'s position as a permanent member of the Security Council and by the difficulty of gathering the necessary two-thirds majority in the General Assembly. International Criminal Court. On 25 February 2022, ICC Prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan stated that the ICC could \"exercise its jurisdiction and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within Ukraine.\" Khan stated on 28 February that he would launch a full ICC investigation and that he had requested his team to \"explore all evidence preservation opportunities\". He stated that it would be faster to officially open the investigation if an ICC member state referred the case for investigation. Lithuanian prime minister Ingrida Simonyte stated on the same day that Lithuania had requested that the ICC investigation be opened.On 2 March 2022, 39 states had already referred the situation in Ukraine to the ICC Prosecutor, who could then open an investigation into past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine by any person from 21 November 2013 onwards. On 11 March two additional referrals were submitted to the ICC Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor declared that investigations would begin. The Prosecutor\\'s office set up an online method for people with evidence to initiate contact with investigators, and a team of investigators, lawyers and other professionals was sent to Ukraine to begin collecting evidence.Neither Ukraine nor Russia is parties to the Rome Statute, the legal basis of the ICC. The ICC has jurisdiction to investigate because Ukraine signed two declarations consenting to ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards. Articles 28(a) and 28(b) of the Rome Statute define the relation between command responsibility and superior responsibility of the chain of command structures of the armed forces involved.As of 10 June, the ICC investigation had dispatched more than 40 investigators, the largest effort ever in ICC history, and there are calls to create a special court or international tribunal to handle the casework.In mid-June, according to the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service, an alleged GRU officer, who was a student of prominent genocide professor Eugene Finkel, attempted to gain entry into the Netherlands under an assumed identity. The purpose was to infiltrate the ICC via an internship, which would have given him to access and potentially influence the pending criminal war crimes case. International Court of Justice. On 27 February, Ukraine filed a petition with the International Court of Justice arguing that Russia violated the Genocide Convention using an unsubstantiated accusation of genocide in order to justify its aggression against Ukraine.On 1 March, the ICJ officially called on Russia to \"act in such a way\" that would make it possible for a decision on provisional measures to become effective. Initial hearings in the case took place on 7 March 2022 at Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands—the seat of the court—to determine Ukraine\\'s entitlement to provisional relief. The Russian delegation did not appear for these proceedings, but submitted a written statement.On 16 March 2022, the court ruled 13–2 that Russia must \"immediately suspend the military operations\" it commenced on 24 February 2022 in Ukraine, with Vice-president Kirill Gevorgian of Russia and Judge Xue Hanqin of China dissenting. The court also unanimously called for \"[b]oth Parties [to] refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve. Proposed specialised court for the crime of aggression. The Council of Europe called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to \"investigate and prosecute the crime of aggression\" committed by \"the political and military leadership of the Russian Federation.\" Under the Council of Europe\\'s proposal, the tribunal should be located in Strasbourg, \"apply the definition of the crime of aggression\" established in customary international law and \"have the power to issue international arrest warrants and not be limited by State immunity or the immunity of heads of State and government and other State officials.\" Similarly, other international bodies such as the European Commission and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and several governments, including the Government of Ukraine, supported the establishment of a specialised court to try the crime of aggression. . In November 2022 the NATO Parliamentary Assembly designated the Russian Federation as a terrorist organization and called upon the international community to \"take collective action towards the establishment of an international tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression committed by Russia with its war against Ukraine.\" In November 2022 the European Commission said that the European Union would work to establish a specialised court to investigate and prosecute Russia for the crime of aggression. Other international organisations. International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. On 4 March 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted 32 in favour versus two against and 13 abstentions to create the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, an independent international committee of three human rights experts with a mandate to investigate violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. ON 23 September 2022, the Commission released their first public statement, confirming the violation of human rights by Russian forces, with instances of indiscriminate killing, sexual violence against children, and torture across dozens of locations in Ukraine. They claim that the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas is a source of immense harm and suffering for civilians. There are detention of the victims as well as visible signs of executions on bodies. They documented cases in which children have been raped, tortured, and unlawfully confined. Children have also been killed and injured in indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), whose monitoring of human rights violations by all parties in Ukraine started in 2014, continued its monitoring during the 2022 Russian invasion, retaining 60 monitors in Ukraine. On 30 March 2022, HRMMU had recorded 24 \"credible allegations\" of Russian use of cluster munitions and 77 incidents of damage to medical facilities during the invasion. Michelle Bachelet stated, \"The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to.\" Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. A report released by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on 12 April 2022 stated that while a detailed assessment of most allegations had not been possible, the mission had found clear patterns of war crimes by the Russian forces. According to the OSCE Report, had the Russian army refrained from indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, the number of civilians casualties would have remained much lower and fewer houses, hospitals, schools and cultural properties would have been damaged or destroyed. The Report denounced the violation of international humanitarian law on military occupation and the violation of international human rights law (right to life, prohibition of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment) mostly in the areas under the direct or indirect control of Russia. International reactions. During House of Commons commentary in February 2022, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that \"anyone who sends a Russian into battle to kill innocent Ukrainians\" could face charges. He remarked in addition, \"Putin will stand condemned in the eyes of the world and of history.\"On 16 March, U.S. President Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal. On 23 March, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States formally declared that the Russian military had committed war crimes in Ukraine, stating, \"based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia\\'s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.\" A week later the US State Department issued a formal assessment that Russia has committed war crimes. On 12 April 2022, Biden described Russia\\'s war crimes in Ukraine as constituting genocide. He added that Putin \"is trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian\".On 3 April 2022, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described abuses by Russian forces in Ukrainian towns, particularly Bucha, as possible war crimes. On 7 April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha were \"very probably war crimes.\"The United Nations General Assembly voted on 7 April 2022 to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council over \"gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights\". ', 'title': 'War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine', 'qa_pairs': '[{\\'Q\\': \\'How many times does it mention that Russia uses \"mock executions\"?\\', \\'A\\': \\'6 times.\\', \\'type\\': \\'multiple_information_retrieval\\', \\'S\\': [\\'On 22 March the non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders reported that Russian forces had captured a Ukrainian fixer and interpreter for Radio France on 5 March as he headed home to a village in Central Ukraine.

The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), a General Reserve Unit attached to Headquarters, 37th Medical Battalion (Separate), Medical Field Service School for administration, was further attached for training and operational control. The detachment was activated by General Order Number 10, Headquarters, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, dated 6 April 1953, under TO&E 8–500, Cell: RA, 25 August 1952. By 31 December 1953, the unit had approximately 95 percent of its authorized equipment.Captain John W Hammett was assigned as the detachment\\'s first commander, and both organized the detachment and trained its newly assigned aviators, who were all newly assigned Medical Service Corps officers fresh out of flight school as well as leading the unit through its first unit tests.  The detachment was equipped with H-13E aircraft with exterior mounted litters and litter covers.The principal activity of this unit consisted of participation in evacuation demonstrations for the Medical Field Service School.Six officers and 26 enlisted men were assigned to the unit at year end. The total authorized strength of the detachment was 7 officers and 24 enlisted.Unit training began on 21 September 1953. In accordance with Army Training Program 8–220. Almost immediately many problems were encountered. The principal difficulty was in the maintenance of aircraft, Within a few days after unit training had begun the program was partially abandoned. On 21 October 1953 the detachment was attached to the 37th Medical Battalion (separate), Medical Field Service School, for administration and training. On 6 October 1953 the unit training was again started with certain modifications of the program to allow more time for aircraft maintenance. This training was completed by 31 December 1953.Effective 7 January 1954 the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) and the 274th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas were relieved from attachment to the Medical Field Service School and were attached to Brooks Air Force Base for quarters and rations in accordance with General Order Number 2, Headquarters, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, dated 22 January 1954.From 28 June through 4 July 1954, all of the aircraft assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, including those of the 57th and 274th under Hammett\\'s command, were deployed to support flood relief efforts along the Rio Grande River near Langtry, Texas caused by Hurricane Agnes. The detachments sent seven aircraft to Laughlin Air Force Base and began using it as a base for their search operations. They began by evacuating passengers, luggage, and mail from a Southern Pacific train which had been cut off from ground evacuation, evacuating 85 passengers to the air base, and then again when shortages of drinking water occurred on the base. The aftermath of the storm made flying difficult.During the period 9 February — 2 March 1955, the 67th Medical Group with attached 603d Medical Company (Clearing)(Separate) and the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was attached to III Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, for participation in Exercise Blue Bolt. Attached to the Group upon arrival from Fort Riley, Kansas was the 47th Surgical Hospital and 928th Medical Company (Ambulance)(Separate). The Group\\'s assigned mission was to furnish field Army Medical Service support (actual and simulated) to the 1st Armored Division and III Corps. One hundred twenty-eight actual casualties were evacuated to the 603d Medical Company (Clearing). The Ambulance Company evacuated 1025 simulated and actual patients. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had the mission of evacuating actual casualties, completing seven pickups with an average patient delivery time of 38 minutes. This was an outstanding accomplishment when measured against the time space factors involved. Twelve hundred patients were routed through an Evacuation Hospital (simulated) established and operated by the Clearing Company.Effective 10 July 1955, the 67th Medical Group was temporarily reorganized to the 67th Medical Service Battalion (ATFA Provisional) by General Order 21, Brooke Army Medical Center, 7 July 1955. The 32d Medical Depot (Army), 47th and 53d Field Hospitals, and the 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) were also reorganized as ATFA Provisional units by the same authority. On 15 July 1955, Dental Service Team KJ (Provisional #1), Team KJ (Provisional #2), and Medical Detachment (ATFA Provisional Team QA) were activated by Brooke Army Medical Center and attached to the 67th Medical Service Battalion (ATFA). These units were to participate in Exercise Sagebrush during the forthcoming months. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was also to participate.On 1 September 1955 an extensive program of training was placed in effect to prepare all participating units for Sagebrush. Many obstacles in personnel, equipment, and limited training time were encountered. By 15 October after extensive field preparation to include special ATFA testing by Brooke Army Medical Center, these units were considered sufficiently advanced to assume their responsibility though 25% of the newly assigned personnel in the field hospitals lacked the MOS training required. Just prior to leaving, the Group presented the largest mounted review in Brooke Army Medical Center history. Approximately 250 vehicles of all types participated.On 25 October 1955 all units moved overland to Louisiana. No major accidents occurred. Valuable experience in atomic warfare operations and the handling of mass casualties was received. The hospitals provided medical care and treatment for both actual and simulated casualties. The 67th Medical Service Battalion exercised operational control over attached medical units. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) received a mission of evacuating actual casualties, reconnaissance, and supply, flying a total of 289 hours. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was further attached to III Corps as a part of the III Corps Aviation Company, executing a total of 165 missions involving 313 flying hours. The 32d Medical Depot (ATFA) supported all units of the Ninth Army during the maneuver. Approximately 10 tons of medical supplies were received, separated, stored, and tallied.At the conclusion of the exercise, all ATFA Medical units returned to Fort Sam Houston in December with the exception of the 47th Field Hospital which remained in the maneuver area on temporary duty at Fort Polk, Louisiana, rendering medical support to Engineer and Signal Corps units. The unit engaged in the close out phase remained ATFA Provisional at end of 1955.General Order 42, Brooke Army Medical Center, 13 December 1955, discontinued all returned provisional units as of 14 December. The remainder of the reporting period was spent on ATFA equipment organization, cleaning, and return.During December 1955, a part of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was preparing for departure in January 1956 for Alaska to participate in Exercise Moose Horn. Effort was being made to properly equip this element for the maneuver.New H-19D aircraft were received by both the 57th and the 82d Medical Detachments beginning in August 1956, with the final aircraft received in the latter part of December. Since the 57th and 82d shared a hanger at Brooks Air Force Base, the 57th painted a circular white background for the red cross on the noses of their aircraft, while the 82d used a square background.In 1957, the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was assigned to the Office of the Surgeon General, further assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas for operational control, further assigned to the 67th Medical Group for administration and training and attached to Brooks Air Force Base for rations and quarters. Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. In October 1957, after hearing rumors all summer, the 57th received a message alerting the unit for a permanent change of station move to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. On 17 October the movement directive was received and on 30 October the movement order was published by Brooke Army Medical Center.  On 5 November the advanced party departed for Fort Meade by private auto.  Upon arrival at Fort Meade, the advance party carried out the necessary details prior to the arrival of the detachment\\'s main body. The main body arrived at Fort Meade on 20 November 1957 with the helicopters arriving on 20 November.  The aircraft were ferried by other pilots within BAMC.  The unit, upon arrival at Fort Meade, remained assigned to the Office of the Surgeon General, attached to the Second United States Army, further attached to Fort Meade, and then further attached to the 68th Medical Group. The mission of the detachment remained training with a secondary mission of supporting Second Army in emergency medical helicopter evacuations.On 15 February 1968, one of the largest snowstorms in years fell in the DC-Baltimore metropolitan area. Requests for emergency evacuations began coming in shortly after it appeared that the snowfall was to be heavy and that it was bogging down normal transportation facilities. No missions, however, were flown until 18 February 1958. On 17 February Second Army put an emergency plan into effect which placed all pilots, crews and aircraft under their operational control. The missions flown were as follows:. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated 2 pregnant women, one from a farmhouse north of Gaithersburg, Maryland, the other from a farmhouse near Bealsville, Maryland to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Total flight time - 02:15. 18 February 1958 - Flew 20 cases of five-in-one rations to Fort Detrick, Maryland from Fort Meade. From Fort Detrick flew to Woodbine, Maryland and evacuated a pregnant woman back to Ft. Detrick. Total flight time - 03:05. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated 2 patients, both from farmhouses near Chestertown, Maryland to Chestertown Airfield. Total flight time - 02:30. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Bozeman, Maryland to Easton, Maryland.  Total flight time - 03:20. 19 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Lewisdale, Maryland to hospital at Laytonsville, Maryland. Total flight time - 03:10. 19 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Sugar Loaf Mountain to Fredrick, Maryland. Total flight time - 02:20. 19 February 1958 - Delivered fuel to farmhouse near Savage, Maryland. Total flight time - 00:30. 19 February 1958 - Delivered fuel to farmhouse near Savage, Maryland. Total flight time - 00:45. 21 February 1958 - Flew 4 photographers to Crystal Beach, Maryland to photograph another mission, Total flight time - 03:30. 22 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Smith Island, Maryland to Crisfield Airfield, Maryland. Total flight time - 04:00. 23 February 1958 - Flew to Chestertown, Maryland to search for 2 lost boys. Bodies of 2 drowned boys were found at Panama by boats. Bodies flown from Panama back to Chestertown. Total flight time - 02:30The detachment came off of alert status on 26 February 1958 and resumed normal duties. The detachment also participated in 68th Medical Group exercises from 4 February to 7 February, evacuating simulated casualties and setting up operations in the field.On 23 March another big snow crippled the northeast sector of the country, however the roads were readily cleared. The detachment was put on stand-by alert for medical evacuation, but none materialized.On 23 March one aircraft flew power lines for the Philadelphia Electric Company around the Coatesville, Pennsylvania area carrying company personnel who were checking for downed power lines.One helicopter was dispatched on 17 July 1958 to support the 338th Medical Group at Fort Meade. It was used for simulated medical evacuations and orientation flights.An H-19 was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia on 24 July 1958 to orient reserve personnel on temporary active duty from the 300th Field Hospital. A simulated evacuation and orientation rides were given. A static display of aircraft and a simulated evacuation were shown to Reserve Officers\\' Training Corps cadets visiting Fort Meade on 31 July 1958.A lecture was given to personnel of the 314th Station Hospital at Fort Lee, Virginia on 21 August 1958. A simulated evacuation and orientation rides were given, Normal unit missions completed the month.On 25 September 1958, a mission of a rather unusual nature was accomplished in an H-19. The Maryland Fish and Game Commission requested that the 57th fly a tubful of live fish from Rock Hall, Maryland to Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland. A noncommissioned officer sat in the \"hole\" with the fish and dropped oxygen tablets in the water, but to no avail.  Of the forty striped bass netted from the Chesapeake Bay, only 4 were alive at the conclusion of the flight.  This was the first, and probably last, time fish had been transported in this manner.On 21 September the 57th went on an overnight field problem on the Fort Meade reservation. The new heliport lighting system was tested for the first time and after quite a bit of practice and resetting the equipment, landings were being made at night quite accurately.On 7 October, one H-19 was sent to\\tFort A. P. Hill, Virginia to act on a stand-by basis for possible casualties resulting from field exercises. The 79th Engineer Group and the 13th Field Hospital were practicing field problems prior to taking their Army Training Tests. The 57th had one helicopter on a stand-by basis from 7 October to 25 October 1958, but only one minor casualty resulted and was the only helicopter evacuation. The helicopter did carry a doctor daily on sick call trips and made a few reconnaissance missions.A flight of two helicopters left Fort Meade on 24 November 1958 to make a proficiency cross-country flight to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The pilots also compared notes on units with their counterparts at Fort Bragg. The flight returned the next day to Fort Meade.An evacuation flight was accomplished on 6 December 1958. An Army Lieutenant Colonel and his family were in volved in an auto accident at Pulaski, West Virginia and placed in the civilian hospital there. A nurse from the Fort Meade Hospital accompanied the flight. The helicopter arrived back at Fort Meade at 1915 hours with Lieutenant Colonel and his wife, where an ambulance brought them to the Fort Meade Hospital. Total flight time logged that day was 07:35 hours.On 10 December 1958 a Tuberculosis patient was flown from the Fort Meade Hospital to Valley Forge General Hospital.The month of January 1959 proved to be quite uneventful until 2000 hours on the 27th.  At that time the detachment commander received a call at home from the Second Army Aviation Section. The detachment was requested to leave the next morning for Meadeville, Pennsylvania to fly a demolition team, equipment, photographers and the Second Army Public Information Officer. An ice jam on French Creek was threatening to flood the town if another rainfall fell. Meadeville had been crippled by a flood two days before causing $5 million worth of damage. The flood waters had receded, but unless the ice could be blasted from the creek the town would be flooded all over again. Three of the unit\\'s H-19s departed Fort Meade at 0845 hours, 28 January 1959 with six demolition men from the 19th Engineer Battalion, two photographers from the 67th Signal Battalion and the Second Army Public Information Office. Also on the flight were three crew chiefs, and six pilots, one of whom was borrowed from the 36th Evacuation Hospital since the detachment had only five pilots present for duty.  The flight of three arrived at Meadeville at 1400 hours and was met at the airfield by the Reserve Advisors for the area, one of whom was made chief of the ice blasting operations.  A reconnaissance flight was made of the ice at 1630 hours that afternoon and the next day, blasting operations began. Reinforcements were brought up via bus from the 19th Engineer Battalion to aid in blasting. The primary duty of the H-19s was to reconnoiter the area and during the last few days to carry 540-pound loads of TNT and drop if from a hover to the demolition team on the ice.  The detachment also carried the teams to the ice in inaccessible areas. Cn 9 February the operation was considered accomplished, and the detachment\\'s helicopters were released.  One helicopter had been released on the 2nd of February and returned to Fort Meade. Weather kept the remaining party from leaving until 11 February. One aircraft had to remain at Meadville because of engine failure during warm-up.Two pilots flew one of the detachment\\'s aircraft to Atlanta, Georgia for major overhaul. They stopped at Fort Benning, Georgia on the way for a tête-à-tête with the 37th Medical Battalion. On 17 April 1959 the detachment had one medical evacuation from Fort Meade to Valley Forge General Hospital.In May 1959 the detachment flew an evacuation from Fort Belvoir to Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\\tA Second Army L-20 picked-up the patient at Nassawadox, Virginia and flew him to Ft Belvoir where he was transferred to a waiting H-19.The detachment flew one aircraft to Atlantic City, New Jersey for 4 days Temporary Duty in conjunction with the American Medical Association Convention and one aircraft to Atlanta, Georgia for SCAMP in June 1959.On 6 July 1959, the detachment used one aircraft to fly medical supplies to Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania on an emergency run. The detachment also flew one aircraft to Fort Indiantown Gap Pennsylvania to put on a demonstration for the reserve troops in summer training in July.On 12 August 1959 the detachment sent one aircraft to Bradford, Pennsylvania to pick-up an Army officer injured in an auto accident. He was flown to Fort Meade and transferred to the hospital. Another aircraft spent 3 days at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania carrying an inspection team to Nike sites.On 18 August 1959 A Navy family member was evacuated from Bainbridge Naval Center to Bethesda Naval Hospital. The patient had a growth in her throat and could hardly breathe. The Naval doctor accompanying the flight almost had to perform a tracheotomy in the air, but the patient recovered her breathe and made it to the hospital.On 21 August 1959 the detachment evacuated one patient to Valley Forge General Hospital. This was the same patient brought to Fort Meade from Bradford, Pennsylvania on 12 August.Medical evacuations increased in September 1959 when a scheduled evacuation run from Carlisle Barracks to Valley Forge General Hospital was initiated - a total of 9 patients were transported this month.In October 1959, the detachment evacuated a patient with an injured kidney from Chestertown, Maryland to Fort Meade.In November 1959, flights from Carlisle Barracks to Valley Forge General Hospital were numerous during the month, with 7 patients transported.As the detachment prepared to transition from H-19s to the first air ambulance detachment to field the HU-1, 1LT John P. Temperilli Jr. returned from the HU-1A Maintenance Course at Fort Worth, Texas and 1LT Paul A. Bloomquist departed for the same course.Evacuations for the December 1959 decreased, with only 3 patients transported during the month.Two crews departed for Fort Worth, Texas to pick-up two HU-1As (Tail numbers 58-3022 & 58–3023), they departed Fort Worth on 11 January 1960 to return to Fort Meade HU-1A #3123 developed frost pump trouble in Charlotte, North Carolina.One crew departed for Fort Worth to pick-up HU-1A tail number 58-3024 and departed Fort Worth for Fort Meade on 21 January 1960.Two crews departed Fort Worth with HU-1As (Tail numbers 58-3025 and 58–3026) on 26 Jan 60. As of the end of January 1960, the 57th had 5 HU-1As and 4 H-19Ds assigned to the unit.On 17 February 1960 the detachment performed an emergency evacuation from Bainbridge to Bethesda Naval Hospital. It ended up that 3 aircraft were involved - 1 H-19 and 2 HU-1As. Check-outs began in the HU-1As. Three pilots soloed in the UH-1 during the month, and on 18 February one pilot set a record on time to return to Fort Meade from Felker Army Airfield, 03:35 in two days. This extended time was due to weather - a 40 knot head wind.On 29 February 1960, the detachment set out for the field.  Just prior to completing the tent pitching, the field problem was called off because HU-1A #3024 had a material failure. No injuries were incurred. Damage was $60,000 and probably a new aircraft to replace # 58–3024.On 5 March the unit started on a routine evacuation mission which turned into a snow emergency at Cambridge, Maryland. Many hours were flown and much rescuing was accomplished.On 23 March 1960 at 0230 hours the detachment received a call to proceed to Elkins, West Virginia to help search for a downed Air Force plane, Two H-19s left at 0600 that morning. The aircraft was found, but all aboard were killed on impact.On 30 April, First Lieutenant Bloomquist and Captain Temperilli had the pleasure of flying General Ridgway in the HU-1A. He was impressed.In May, the unit was alerted to depart for Chile to assist in the disaster caused by an earthquake. All personnel except a rear detachment of one officer and two enlisted deployed with four of the detachment\\'s HU-1As.The operation in Chile and the detachment returned home on 25 June 1960.The 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized and redesignated as the 57th Medical Platoon effective 1 July 1960.One aircraft and crew participated in TRIPHIBOUS OPERATION at Fort Story, Virginia; demonstrating a simulated medevac to a ship.The 57th Medical Platoon was redesignated the 57th Medical Detachment on 10 March 1961.In December 1961 the detachment was notified that it would be participating in an exercise in Asia, but before it deployed, the 82d Medical Detachment was substituted for the 57th, and deployed on Exercise Great Shelf in the Philippines in March 1962. Operations in Vietnam, 1962–1973. Advisory support, 1962–1964. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) received its final alert for overseas deployment on 15 February 1962.Unit aircraft, one officer and five enlisted departed Fort George G. Meade, Maryland on 3 March 1962 for the Brookley Ocean Terminal in Mobile, Alabama. While in Mobile, the detachment\\'s aircraft were processed for overseas shipment, loaded aboard the USNS Crotan, and arrived at Saigon on 20 April 1962.Yellow disk TAT equipment and two enlisted departed Fort Meade on 16 April 1962 and arrived in Saigon on 20 April 1962.The main body of the 57th\\'s personnel departed Fort Meade on 18 April 1962 and arrived at Nha Trang just before noon on 26 April 1962.The 57th Medical Detachment became operational at Nha Trang on 5 May 1962 when aircraft and fuel became available.Aircraft were split to station three at Nha Trang and two at Qui Nhon. The detachment did not become operational at Qui Nhon until fuel became available on the 12 June 1962. Lack of information and preparedness when segments of the detachment arrived in South Vietnam was the main reason why operational capability could not be reached sooner than indicated. Contributing factors were a lack of fuel for the aircraft and differences in operational concept as set forth by Letter of Instructions, Headquarters, U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam, dated 24 April 1962, and those set forth by the detachment commander.The concept of operations as of the end of July 1962, a 3–2 split of aircraft with supporting personnel was feasible and was being carried out with minor difficulties that could be resolved at the detachment level. A major problem area was the lack of adequate communications. The unit\\'s primary mission of on call Emergency Aeromedical Evacuation could not function properly unless the information on where casualties were located could be relayed to the unit so that a response could be immediate relative to personnel becoming casualties.No real estate was provided for setting up the detachment at Nha Trang Air Base. The detachment acquired its own real estate but still did not have construction for performing maintenance on organic aircraft. As of the end of July 1962, all supplies were under canvas or in Conex containers. Aircraft maintenance was performed in the open and when inclement weather arrived, maintenance ceased, as has been the case when changing three component parts of the aircraft in June 1962.Requests for action were slow and in one instance had a demoralizing effect on personnel. The request for flight status on one enlisted performing hazardous duty from the time the unit arrived had not been received as of the end of July 1962.As of 1 October 1962, a lack of logistical support effected the overall operational capability of the detachment. This was further aggravated by being split into two locations. As of 1 October 1962 it was felt that the need existed for such a split, but unless logistical support for aircraft was improved, some consideration would have to be given to employing the detachment in one location to maintain 24-hour operational capability.As of 1 October 1962, the detachment was authorized five aircraft and had four assigned: Aircraft 58-2081 was EDP for 20 items. Time until the aircraft would become flyable was unknown.. Aircraft 58-3022 was crash damaged, and the time until the aircraft would be replaced was unknown.. Aircraft 58-3023 was flyable but would be grounded in 45 hours flying time for two items.. Aircraft 58-3026 was flyable but would be grounded in 23 flying hours for a tail rotor hub assembly.. Aircraft 58-3055 would be grounded in 6 flying hours for a tail rotor hub assembly. The part had been extended and could not be extended further.The detachment was housed in tentage at the airfield without adequate facilities for storing supplies or performing maintenance. Coordination with Nha Trang Airbase Commander had been made and a site for a permanent hanger type building had been approved. As of 1 October 1962, a request and recommended plans had been submitted but the status was unknown to the 57th.The detachment was completely non-operational from 17 November to 14 December 1962. This situation was caused by the turn-in of certain aircraft parts for use by another unit. Until 17 November 1962, the detachment had maintained one aircraft at Nha Trang and one aircraft at Qui Nhon. From 14 November 1962 thru the end of the year the detachment had one aircraft flyable, and it was rotated between the two locations.As of 31 December 1962, the detachment was authorized five aircraft, assigned four aircraft, and had one aircraft flyable. The aircraft status by tail number was:. Aircraft 50-2081: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 50-3023: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 58-3026: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 58-3035: FlyableIn early November 1962, the detachment orderly room was moved into a bamboo hut which allowed for more room and ease of working conditions than was afforded by a General-Purpose medium tent. The unit supply was still housed in two GP medium tents which did not provide a good working atmosphere nor acceptable security or storage of unit equipment. No further information on the construction of a hangar and other additional workspace for the detachment was available as of 31 December 1962.. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had the mission of aeromedical evacuation in support of United States Armed Forces operations in the Republic of Vietnam. This rather vague and all-encompassing definition gave rise to many questions throughout the country as to who exactly would be evacuated and in what priority.  The situation was finally clarified on 4 September 1963 with the publication of United States Army Support Group, Vietnam Regulation 59–1. The regulation established the priority as: U.S. military and civilian personnel; members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam; and other personnel for humanitarian reasons. This same regulation also established the procedures to be followed for requesting aeromedical evacuation using a standardized nine-line medical evacuation request.Towards the end of 1963 the fruits of this regulation became apparent as a definite standardized procedure evolved from the positive application of the regulation.This left the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) responsible for aeromedical evacuation in the II, III and IV Corps Tactical Zones within the limits of USASGV Regulation 59–1, while the United States Marine Corps was responsible for aeromedical evacuation within the I Corps Tactical Zone.The detachment was organized under Table of Organization and Equipment 8-500C with Change 2. The authorized strength of the detachment was 7 officers and 22 enlisted. The Commanding General of the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam authorized an increase in unit strength from 7 to 10 officers. This was due to the requirement to have two aviators per aircraft when flying in the Republic of Vietnam. A request to modify the unit TO&E had also been submitted.Beginning in late January 1963, operational support was provided from three separate bases in the country.  The headquarters section with three aircraft was located at Tan Son Nhut Airbase in Saigon. Another section was located in the seacoast town of Qui Nhon with one aircraft, while the third section was located inland of Qui Nhon at Pleiku in the central highlands.The headquarters section supported operations in the III and IV Corps Tactical Zones, while operations in the II Corps Tactical Zone was provided by the sections in Qui Nhon and Pleiku. The two separate locations in the II Corps Tactical Zone were required due to the large geographic area and the rugged mountains in the highlands.  The relocation of aircraft was required due to increased Viet Cong activity in the IV Corps Tactical Zone.in March 1963, a changeover of the detachment\\'s aircraft occurred, with the unit\\'s UH-1As being replaced with UH-1Bs.The unit remained assigned to the 8th Field Hospital and under the operational control of the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam.The detachment operated at under TOE strength until April, when an Infantry officer was assigned to augment the crew at Qui Nhon.In June, that officer was released and three new officers from the Combat arms were assigned on Verbal Orders of the Commanding General, U.S. Army Support Command, Vietnam to bring the detachment\\'s total officer strength to ten. One was an Infantry officer, the second an Armor officer, and the third a Warrant Officer aviator.In October the Warrant Officer rotated home and was replaced by an Armor officer.Throughout 1963, the enlisted strength of the detachment hovered around the TO&E authorized strength of 23.Extensive scheduled training operations as understood in most army circles were not included in the detachment\\'s yearly plan from the time they began operations in 1962 until they began training the Republic of Vietnam Air Force in Medical Evacuation Operations in 1970. There were two basic reasons for this. First, the realization that the entire deployment in Vietnam was a continual practical exercise, and second the desire to keep non-essential flights to an absolute minimum. Training focused on pilot and crew preparation and certification for their duties, such as Pilot in Command, Instructor Pilot, and so on, or training in new systems.Maintenance support for the detachment\\'s organic aircraft remained above the army\\'s stated minimum goal of 68% aircraft availability during 1963, despite the detachment\\'s heavy workload of 2,094 flying hours for the year. This was especially significant since the detachment was designed to operate from one location but was operating from three for the majority of the year. Close coordination with field maintenance units at the locations where aircraft were stationed through the headquarters section at Tan Son Nhut was a dominant factor in maintaining this achievement. However, the crux of all maintenance support rested with the detachment itself and this was where the problems had to be resolved. A heavy work schedule was maintained to keep as many aircraft as possible available for flight. The major burden fell on the two single-ship sections.Requests for aeromedical evacuation were channeled through both Army (Combat Operations Center) and Air Force (Air Operations Center) communications systems to the 57th Medical Detachment as directed in USASGV Regulation 59–1. Action on these requests then became the responsibility of the commanding officer of the 57th Medical Detachment.Requests for aeromedical coverage on airmobile assault operations were forwarded directly from the requesting unit to the 57th Medical Detachment, and the 57th\\'s detachment commander would coordinate with the assaulting unit\\'s chain of command on the mission. The 57th Medical Detachment had, upon request, covered every major operation in the Republic of Vietnam. This coverage was provided by sending one aircraft to the staging area to the assault staging area to either fly with the assault unit or stand by in the staging area. This made immediate response in the area of the assault possible.During 1963, night medical evacuation had become a regular service of the detachment and by the end of the year was considered its forte. Due to both the detachment\\'s experience and willingness to fly at night most requests for night evacuations came straight to the detachment. An aircraft and crew—a pilot in command, pilot, crew chief, and medic—at all three locations was continually made available for night operations.Since it was the detachment\\'s policy to accept all legitimate requests for aeromedical evacuation whether day or night, the unit was, de facto, available for aeromedical evacuations on a 24-hour basis.Major evacuation for U.S. casualties was provided in the Saigon area. These patients were brought directly to the Tan Son Nhut airfield whenever feasible. On assault operation coverage, medical aid was usually first administered to the casualty by the Medical Corps officer that accompanied the assaulting unit into the staging area.Vietnamese casualties were usually transported to the nearest field hospital. If further evacuation to the rear was requested by Vietnamese medical personnel and was not contrary to USASCV Regulation 59–1, the request was honored.Patient care as provided by the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 consisted mainly of in-flight and emergency medical treatment. Many times, this treatment was the very first the casualty received and consequently turned out to be a definite lifesaving step. The flight medic also provided limited first aid to patients waiting in the staging areas for further rearward evacuation when time permitted.Throughout the war, although medical evacuation of patients constituted the major workload for the detachment, there were considerable missions in other areas. Aeromedical evacuation helicopters provided coverage for armed and troop transport helicopters during combat heliborne assaults, U.S. Air Force defoliation missions, training parachute jumps, convoys of troop and equipment carrying vehicles, and transport of key medical personnel and emergency medical material.Of the many problems evolving from the operation of any unit, there is one that usually stands before all others. The foible that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment was that of providing total aeromedical coverage to both American and Vietnamese combatants and noncombatants in the Republic of Vietnam. Although the Vietnamese were responsible for evacuating their own casualties, many contingencies came into play that prevented them from doing so, such as large numbers of casualties, lack of sufficient aircraft, or large areas to be covered. To better enable the 57th Medical Detachment to provide this vital coverage, it was necessary to split the unit into three operational sections. This resulted in coverage of a greater area, but also resulted in reduced coverage in Saigon and areas further South. However, this was regarded as the lesser of the two operational constraints.This then was the nature of the problem. As evacuation assets were arrayed in 1963, many of the aviation companies were forced to provide tactical aircraft to supplement aeromedical aircraft whenever helicopter ambulances of the 57th Medical Detachment were not available due to either prior commitments or the restrictions imposed by aircraft maintenance. This condition would be relieved to a great extent by the augmentation of another helicopter ambulance unit. At the end of 1963 a study was in preparation by the United States Army Support Group, Vietnam to evaluate such a proposal.Another area that caused problems for the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 was the matter of having to justify the unit\\'s existence to higher headquarters on the basis of yearly flying hours. This was interpreted by the 57th to mean that a unit\\'s worth was solely dependent on the number of hours flown in a given period and not in the actual accomplishments of the unit—for example, the number of patients evacuated or lives saved. This demonstrated that some individuals did not fully understand the real value of having a trained aeromedical evacuation unit available for immediate response to evacuation requests. Since the detachment performed missions for medical evacuation only, the yearly flight time on aircraft depended solely on the number of evacuations requested. Unlike other aviation units, no administrative or logistical missions were performed, and consequently, the detachment\\'s flight time was less than most other units then serving in the Republic of Vietnam. Because of this shortcoming, another study was directed by the U.S. Support Group, Vietnam to determine the feasibility of integrating the 57th Medical Detachment with those of other logistical units for the purpose on increasing its effectiveness.The last problem area identified in 1963 that was worth of mention was that concerning maintenance. As mentioned above, the problem was a result of operating from three distinct sections at Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Saigon. To maintain a flyable aircraft at all times in all sections required more man hours than if the aircraft were concentrated in one location. Thus, a heavier than normal schedule was required by the maintenance personnel at all locations. Despite this, at times no amount of manpower could an aircraft flyable and in this case another aircraft would have to be borrowed from a unit in the immediate vicinity, The limitations on this type of arrangement are readily apparent. The detachment\\'s recommended solution was the deployment of a second air ambulance detachment to Vietnam and the concentration of the 57th\\'s aircraft at one location.During its first year in country, the 57th worked without a tactical call sign, simply using \"Army\" and the tail number of the aircraft. For example, if a pilot were flying a helicopter with the serial number 62-12345, his call sign would be \"Army 12345\". The 57th communicated internally on any vacant frequency it could find. Major Lloyd Spencer, the 57th\\'s second detachment commander in Vietnam, decided that this improvised system needed to be replaced by something more formal. He visited the Navy Support Activity, Saigon, which controlled all the call signs in South Vietnam. He received a Signal Operations Instructions book that listed all the unused call signs. Most, like \"Bandit\", were more suitable for assault units than for medical evacuation units. But one entry, \"Dust Off\", epitomized the 57th\\'s medical evacuation missions. Since the countryside then was dry and dusty, helicopter pickups in the fields often blew dust, dirt, blankets, and shelter halves all over the men on the ground. By adopting \"Dust Off\", Spencer found for Army aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam a name that lasted the rest of the war.:\\u200a29\\u200aAlthough unit callsigns at the time were rotated periodically to preserve operations security, it was determined that having a fixed callsign for medical evacuation—and a fixed frequency—would be more advantageous for medical evacuation operations, and so the 57th\\'s callsign was not changed as it normally would have been at the end of the period for the Signal Operations Instructions.. January 1964 found the 57th Medical Detachment located at Tan Son Nhut airport, Saigon. Two air ambulances and crews were attached to the 52d Aviation Battalion, with one helicopter and crew each located at Pleiku and Qui Nhon to provide aeromedical evacuation support within the II Corps area. The remaining three air ambulances and personnel were attached to the 45th Transportation Battalion at Tan Son Nhut providing aeromedical evacuation support within the III and IV Corps areas.The mission of the detachment was to provide aeromedical evacuation support to U.S. Forces in the Republic of Vietnam and aeromedical evacuation assistance to the Republic of Vietnam as requested. Before the month of January ended the unit was detached from the 145th Aviation Battalion (previously the 45th Transportation Battalion) and attached to Headquarters Detachment, United States Army Support Group, Vietnam. As a result of the new attachment to Headquarters Detachment, U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam, the unit enlisted personnel moved into new quarters in the Support Group Compound.During the latter part of February consideration was given to relocating the Flight Section in the II Corps area to the IV Corps area because of increased activity in the lower Mekong Delta. This trend of increased activity in IV Corps continued and consequently on 1 March, Detachment A, 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), (Provisional), was organized and stationed at Sóc Trăng Airfield  with attachment to the Delta Aviation Battalion. This reorganization and relocation placed two aircraft with crews in Soc Trang with the remaining aircraft and personnel located at Tan Son Nhut. A sharp increase in the number of patients evacuated during the month of March demonstrated that the relocation was well justified. The increase of patients evacuated in March initiated an upward trend that reached a peak in July with 768 patients evacuated.With the upward trend in flight time, patients evacuated, and missions flown there was also a corresponding undesirable upward trend in the number of aircraft hit by enemy fire. On 3 April 1964, First Lieutenant Brian Conway had the dubious distinction of being the first Medical Service Corp Aviator to be wounded in action in Vietnam. A .30-caliber round passed through his ankle as he terminated an approach into a field location for a patient pick-up. This wound resulted in Lt. Conway\\'s evacuation to the United States.Other statistics which reflected an upward trend during the spring and early summer of 1964 were night flying time and missions. The evacuation of patients at night became routine. These missions were accomplished with a single helicopter flying blackout. It was interesting to note that throughout the entire year, only one hit was received at night although searching fire was often observed. Much of the success of the detachment\\'s night operations was due to the excellent U.S. Air Force radar coverage of the III and IV Corps area. Paris and Paddy Control consistently placed unit aircraft over the target.Although the number of Vietnamese casualties rose in 1963, the South Vietnamese military refused to set up its own aeromedical evacuation unit. The VNAF response to requests for medical evacuation depended on aircraft availability, the security of the landing zone, and the mood and temperament of the VNAF pilots. If the South Vietnamese had no on-duty or standby aircraft ready to fly a medical evacuation mission, they passed the request on to the 57th.  Even when they accepted the mission themselves, their response usually suffered from a lack of leadership and poor organization. Since South Vietnamese air mission commanders rarely flew with their flights, the persons responsible for deciding whether to abort a mission often lacked the requisite experience. As a MACV summary said: \"Usually the decision was made to abort, and the air mission commander could do nothing about it. When an aggressive pilot was in the lead ship, the aircraft came through despite the firing. American advisers reported that on two occasions only the first one or two helicopters landed; the rest hovered out of reach of the wounded who needed to get aboard.\"An example of the poor quality of VNAF medical evacuation occurred in late October 1963, when the ARVN 2d Battalion, 14th Regiment, conducted Operation LONG HUU II near O Lac in the Delta. At dawn the battalion began its advance. Shortly after they moved out, the Viet Cong ambushed them, opening fire from three sides with automatic weapons and 81 -mm. mortars. At 0700 casualty reports started coming into the battalion command post. The battalion commander sent his first casualty report to the regimental headquarters at 0800: one ARVN soldier dead and twelve wounded, with more casualties in the paddies. He then requested medical evacuation helicopters. By 0845 the casualty count had risen to seventeen lightly wounded, fourteen seriously wounded, and four dead. He sent out another urgent call for helicopters. The battalion executive officer and the American adviser prepared two landing zones, one marked by green smoke for the seriously wounded and a second by yellow smoke for the less seriously wounded. Not until 1215 did three VNAF H-34\\'s arrive over O Lac to carry out the wounded and dead. During the delay the ARVN battalion stayed in place to protect their casualties rather than pursue the retreating enemy. The American adviser wrote later: \"It is common that, when casualties are sustained, the advance halts while awaiting evacuation. Either the reaction time for helicopter evacuation must be improved, or some plan must be made for troops in the battalion rear to provide security for the evacuation and care of casualties.\"The ARVN medical services also proved inadequate to handle the large numbers of casualties. In the Delta, ARVN patients were usually taken to the Vietnamese Provincial Hospital at Can Tho. As the main treatment center for the Delta, it often had a backlog of patients. At night only one doctor was on duty, for the ARVN medical service lacked physicians. If Dustoff flew in many casualties, that doctor normally treated as many as he could; but he rarely called in any of his fellow doctors to help. In return they would not call him on his night off. Many times at night Dustoff pilots would have to make several flights into Can Tho. On return flights the pilots often found loads of injured ARVN soldiers lying on the landing pad where they had been left some hours earlier. After several such flights few pilots could sustain any enthusiasm for night missions.Another problem was that the ARVN officers sometimes bowed to the sentiments of their soldiers, many of whom believed that the soul lingers between this world and the next if the body is not properly buried. They insisted that Dustoff ships fly out dead bodies, especially if there were no seriously wounded waiting for treatment. Once, after landing at a pickup site north of Saigon, a Dustoff crew saw many ARVN wounded lying on the ground. But the other ARVN soldiers brought bodies to the helicopter to be evacuated first. As the soldiers loaded the dead in one side of the ship, a Dustoff medical corpsman pulled the bodies out the other side. The pilot stepped out of the helicopter to explain in halting French to the ARVN commander that his orders were to carry out only the wounded. But an ARVN soldier manning a .50-caliber machine gun on a nearby armored personnel carrier suddenly pointed his weapon at the Huey. This convinced the Dustoff crew to fly out the bodies. They carried out one load but did not return for another.Early in 1964 the growing burden of aeromedical evacuation fell on the 57th\\'s third group of new pilots, crews, and maintenance personnel. The helicopters were still the 1963 UH-1B models, but most of the new pilots were fresh from flight school. Kelly was described as \"a gruff, stubborn, dedicated soldier who let few obstacles prevent him from finishing a task.\" Within six months he set an example of courage and hard work that Dustoff pilots emulated for the rest of the war, and into the 21st Century.Kelly quickly took advantage of the 57th\\'s belated move to the fighting in the south. On 1 March 1964 the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam ordered the aircraft at Pleiku and Qui Nhon to move to the Delta. Two helicopters and five pilots, now called Detachment A, 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, flew to the U.S. base at Soc Trang. Once a fighter base for both the French and the Japanese, Soc Trang was a compound roughly 1,000 by 3,000 feet, surrounded by rice paddies.Unit statistics soon proved the wisdom of the move south: the number of Vietnamese evacuees climbed from 193 in February to 416 in March. Detachment A continued its coverage of combat in the Delta until October 1964, when the 82nd Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) from the States took over that area. Major Kelly, who had taken command of the 57th on 11 January, moved south with Detachment A, preferring the field and flying to ground duty in Saigon.Detachment A in Soc Trang lived in crude \"Southeast Asia\" huts with sandbags and bunkers for protection against enemy mortar and ground attack. The rest of the 57th in Saigon struggled along with air conditioning, private baths, a mess hall, and a bar in their living quarters. In spite of the contrast, most pilots preferred Soc Trang. It was there that Major Kelly and his pilots forged the Dustoff tradition of valorous and dedicated service.Kelly and his teams also benefited from two years of growing American involvement in Vietnam. By the spring of 1964 the United States had 16,000 military personnel in South Vietnam (3,700 officers and 12,300 enlisted men). The Army, which accounted for 10,100 of these, had increased its aircraft in South Vietnam from 40 in December 1961 to 370 in December 1963. For the first time since its arrival two years ago the 57th was receiving enough Dustoff requests to keep all its pilots busy.Kelly faced one big problem when he arrived: the helicopters that the 57th had received the year before were showing signs of age and use, and Brigadier General Joseph Stilwell Jr., the Support Group commander, could find no new aircraft for the detachment. Average flight time on the old UH-1Bs was 800 hours. But this did not deter the new pilots from each flying more than 100 hours a month in medical evacuations. Some of them stopped logging their flight time at 140 hours, so that the flight surgeon would not ground them for exceeding the monthly ceiling.The new team continued and even stepped-up night operations. In April 1964, the detachment flew 110 hours at night while evacuating ninety-nine patients. To aid their night missions in the Delta the pilots made a few special plotting flights, during which they sketched charts of the possible landing zones, outlined any readily identifiable terrain features, and noted whether radio navigational aid could be received. During one such flight Major Kelly and his copilot heard on their radio that a VNAF T-28, a fixed-wing plane, had gone down. After joining the search, Kelly soon located the plane. While he and his crew circled the area trying to decide how to approach the landing zone, the Viet Cong below opened fire on the helicopter. One round passed up through the open cargo door and slammed into the ceiling. Unfazed, Kelly shot a landing to the T-28, taking fire from all sides. Once down, he, his crew chief, and his medic jumped out and sprayed submachine gun fire at the Viet Cong while helping the VNAF pilot destroy his radios and pull the M60 machine guns from his plane. Kelly left the area without further damage and returned the VNAF pilot to his unit. Kelly and his Dustoff crew flew more than 500 miles that day.On 2 April one of the Detachment A crews flying to Saigon from Soc Trang received a radio call that a village northwest of them had been overrun. Flying up to the area where the Mekong River flows into South Vietnam from Cambodia, they landed at the village of Cai Cai, where during the night Viet Cong had killed or wounded all the people. Soldiers lay at their fighting positions where they had fallen, women and children where they had been shot. The Dustoff teams worked the rest of the day flying out the dead and wounded, putting two or three children on each litter.One night that spring Detachment A pilots Capt. Patrick Henry Brady] and 2d Lt. Ernest J. Sylvester were on duty when a call came in that an A1-E Skyraider, a fixed-wing plane, had gone down near the town of Rach Gia. Flying west to the site, they radioed the Air Force radar controller, who guided them to the landing zone and warned them of Viet Cong antiaircraft guns. As the Dustoff ship drew near the landing zone, which was plainly marked by the burning A1-E, the pilot of another nearby Al-E radioed that he had already knocked out the Viet Cong machine guns. But when Brady and Sylvester approached the zone the Viet Cong opened fire. Bullets crashed into the cockpit and the pilots lost control of the aircraft. Neither was seriously wounded and they managed to regain control and hurry out of the area. Viet Cong fire then brought down the second Al-E. A third arrived shortly and finally suppressed the enemy fire, allowing a second Dustoff ship from Soc Trang to land in the zone. The crew chief and medical corpsman found what they guessed was the dead pilot of the downed aircraft, then found the pilot of the second, who had bailed out, and flew him back to Soc Trang.A short time later Brady accompanied an ARVN combat assault mission near Phan Thiet, northeast of Saigon. While Brady\\'s Dustoff ship circled out of range of enemy ground fire, the transport helicopters landed and the troops moved out into a wooded area heavily defended by the Viet Cong. The ARVN soldiers immediately suffered several casualties and called for Dustoff. Brady\\'s aircraft took hits going into and leaving the landing zone, but he managed to fly out the wounded. In Phan Thiet, while he was assessing the damage to his aircraft, an American adviser asked him if he would take ammunition back to the embattled ARVN unit when he returned for the next load of wounded. After discussing the propriety of carrying ammunition in an aircraft marked with red crosses, Brady and his pilots decided to consider the ammunition as \"preventive medicine\" and fly it into the LZ for the ARVN troops. Back at the landing zone Brady found that Viet Cong fire had downed an L-19 observation plane. Brady ran to the crash site, but both the American pilot and the observer had been killed. The medical corpsman and crew chief pulled the bodies from the wreckage and loaded them on the helicopter. Brady left the ammunition and flew out with the dead.By the time the helicopter had finished its mission and returned to Tan Son Nhut, most of the 57th were waiting. News of an American death traveled quickly in those early days of the war. Later, reflecting on the incident, Kelly praised his pilots for bringing the bodies back even though the 57th\\'s mission statement said nothing about moving the dead. But he voiced renewed doubts about the ferrying of ammunition.Brady later explained what actually happened behind the scenes. Upon landing, Brady was met by Kelly and called aside. Expecting to be sternly counseled, Brady was surprised when Kelly simply asked why he had carried in ammunition and carried out the dead. Brady replied that the ammunition was \"preventive medicine\" and that the dead \"were angels\", and he couldn\\'t refuse them. Kelly simply walked back to the group involved in that day\\'s missions and told them that it was the type of mission he wanted the 57th to be flying.  Brady realized the significance of Kelly\\'s statement, as Kelly would be responsible for any fallout from Brady\\'s actions.In fact, the Dustoff mission was again under attack. When Support Command began to pressure the 57th to place removable red crosses on the aircraft and begin accepting general purpose missions, Kelly stepped up unit operations. Knowing that removable red crosses had already been placed on transport and assault helicopters in the north, Kelly told his men that the 57th must prove its worth-and by implication the value of dedicated medical helicopters-beyond any shadow of doubt.While before the 57th had flown missions only in response to a request, it now began to seek missions. Kelly himself flew almost every night. As dusk came, he and his crew would depart Soc Trang and head southwest for the marshes and Bac Lieu, home of a team from the 73d Aviation Company and detachments from two signal units, then further south to Ca Mau, an old haunt of the Viet Minh, whom the French had never been able to dislodge from its forested swamps. Next, they would fly south almost to the tip of Ca Mau Peninsula, then at Nam Can reverse their course toward the Seven Canals area. After a check for casualties there at Vi Thanh, they turned northwest up to Rach Gia on the Gulf of Siam, then on to the Seven Mountains region on the Cambodian border. From there they came back to Can Tho, the home of fourteen small American units, then up to Vinh Long on the Mekong River, home of the 114th Aviation Company (Airmobile Light). Finally, they flew due east to Truc Giang, south to the few American advisers at Phu Vinh, then home to Soc Trang. The entire circuit was 720 kilometers.If any of the stops had patients to be evacuated, Kelly\\'s crew loaded them on the aircraft and continued on course, unless a patient\\'s condition warranted returning immediately to Soc Trang. After delivering the patients, they would sometimes resume the circuit. Many nights they carried ten to fifteen patients who otherwise would have had to wait until daylight to receive the care they needed. In March, this flying from outpost to outpost, known as \"scarfing\", resulted in seventy-four hours of night flying that evacuated nearly one-fourth of that month\\'s 448 evacuees. The stratagem worked; General Stilwell dropped the idea of having the 57th use removable red crosses.Although most of Dustoff\\'s work in the Delta was over flat, marshy land, Detachment A sometimes had to work the difficult mountainous areas near the Cambodian border. Late on the afternoon of 11 April Kelly received a mission request to evacuate two wounded ARVN soldiers from Phnom Kto Mountain of the Seven Mountains of An Giang Province. When he arrived he found that the only landing zone near the ground troops was a small area surrounded by high trees below some higher ground held by the Viet Cong. Despite the updrafts common to mountain flying, the mists, and the approaching darkness, Kelly shot an approach to the area. The enemy opened fire and kept firing until Kelly\\'s ship dropped below the treetops into the landing zone. Kelly could set the aircraft down on only one skid; the slope was too steep. Since only one of the wounded was at the landing zone, Kelly and his crew had to balance the ship precariously while waiting for the ARVN troops to carry the other casualty up the mountain. With both patients finally on board, Kelly took off and again flew through enemy fire. The medical corpsman promptly began working on the Vietnamese, one of whom had been wounded in five places. Both casualties survived.When Kelly flew such a mission he rarely let bad weather darkness, or the enemy stop him from completing it. He fought his way to the casualties and brought them out. On one mission the enemy forced him away from the landing zone before he could place the patients on board. An hour later he tried to land exactly the same way, through enemy fire, and this time he managed to load the patients safely. The Viet Cong showed their indifference to the red crosses on the aircraft by trying to destroy it with small arms, automatic weapons, and mortars, even while the medical corpsman and crew chief loaded the patients. One round hit the main fuel drain valve and JP-4 fuel started spewing. Kelly elected to fly out anyway, practicing what he had preached since he arrived in Vietnam by putting the patients above all else and hurrying them off the battlefield. He radioed the Soc Trang tower that his ship was leaking fuel and did not have much left, and that he wanted priority on landing. The tower operator answered that Kelly had priority and asked whether he needed anything else. Kelly said, \"Yes, bring me some ice cream.\" just after he landed on the runway the engine quit, fuel tanks empty. Crash trucks surrounded the helicopter. The base commander drove up, walked over to Kelly, and handed him a quart of ice cream.Apart from the Viet Cong, the 57th\\'s greatest problem at that time was a lack of pilots. After Kelly reached Vietnam he succeeded in having the other nine Medical Service Corps pilots who followed him assigned to the 57th. He needed more, but the Surgeon General\\'s Aviation Branch seemed to have little understanding of the rigors of Dustoff flying. In the spring of 1964 the Aviation Branch tried to have new Medical Service Corps pilots assigned to nonmedical helicopter units in Vietnam, assuming that they would benefit more from combat training than from Dustoff flying.On 15 June 1964, Kelly gave his response:. \"As for combat experience, the pilots in this unit are getting as much or more combat-support flying experience than any unit over here. You must understand that everybody wants to get into the Aeromedical Evacuation business. To send pilots to U.T.T. [the Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company, a nonmedical unit] or anywhere else is playing right into their hands. I fully realize that I do not know much about the big program, but our job is evacuation of casualties from the battlefield. This we are doing day and night, without escort aircraft, and with only one ship for each mission. Since I have been here we have evacuated 1800 casualties and in the last three months we have flown 242.7 hours at night. No other unit can match this. The other [nonmedical] units fly in groups, rarely at night, and always heavily armed.\"He continued:. \"If you want the MSC Pilots to gain experience that will be worthwhile, send them to this unit. It is a Medical Unit and I don\\'t want to see combat arms officers in this unit. I will not mention this again. However, for the good of the Medical Service Corps Pilots and the future of medical aviation I urge you to do all that you can to keep this unit full of MSC Pilots.\"In other words, Kelly thought that his unit had a unique job to do and that the only effective training for it could be found in the cockpit of a Dustoff helicopter.Perhaps presciently, Kelly closed his letter as follows:. \"Don\\'t go to the trouble of answering this letter for I know that you are very busy. Anyhow, everything has been said. I will do my best, and please remember \\'Army Medical Evacuation FIRST\\'.\"With more and more fighting occurring in the Delta and around Saigon, the 57th could not always honor every evacuation request. U.S. Army helicopter assault companies were forced to keep some of their aircraft on evacuation standby, but without a medical corpsman or medical equipment. Because of the shortage of Army aviators and the priority of armed combat support, the Medical Service Corps did not have enough pilots to staff another Dustoff unit in Vietnam. Most Army aeromedical evacuation units elsewhere already worked with less than their permitted number of pilots. Although Army aviation in Vietnam had grown considerably since 1961, by the summer of 1964 its resources fell short of what it needed to perform its missions, especially medical evacuation.Army commanders, however, seldom have all the men and material they can use, and Major Kelly knew that he had to do his best with what he had.Kelly had begun to realize that, although he preferred flying and being in the field to Saigon, he could better influence things by returning to Tan Son Nhut. After repeated requests from Brady, Kelly told him that he would relinquish command of Detachment A of the 57th at Soc Trang to Brady on 1 July and return to Saigon—although he then later told Brady he was extending his stay in the Delta for at least another month.. The second half of the year began with the sad event of the death of the detachment commander, Major Charles L. Kelly on 1 July 1964. He was struck in the chest by a Viet Cong bullet while attempting a patient pick-up. The aircraft crashed with the other three crewmembers receiving injuries. His dying words, \"When I have your wounded,\" would become both a creed and rallying cry for both the 57th and all other Dustoff units to follow them.. Captain Paul A. Bloomquist assumed command of the detachment and remained as commander until the arrival of Major Howard A. Huntsman Jr. on 12 August.Evacuation workload began a downward toward trend in August from the high reached in July. September showed a slight gain over August, but the trend downward continued for the remainder of the year.. Two factors were pertinent in the downward trend. First, the Vietnamese Air Force began playing an increasing role in the evacuation of Vietnamese patients. Although the evacuation of Vietnamese personnel was a secondary mission this in reality constituted the major portion of the workload for the 57th. The second factor was the arrival of the 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) in October. This detachment was located in Soc Trang. This relieved Detachment A of the 57th and the unit was reconsolidated as a complete unit at Tan Son Nhut on 7 October 1964. This was the first time. that the unit had operated from one location in entirety since its arrival in Vietnam.There was a personnel exchange between the 82nd and the 57th. This involved six officers and was accomplished in order to better distribute rotation dates for the 82d Medical Detachment. Four enlisted personnel were also exchanged. Transferred from the 82d to the 57th were Captain Raymond A. Jackson, Captain Douglas E. Moore, and Lieutenant John J. McGowan. Transferred to the 82nd were Lieutenant Armond C. Simmons, Lieutenant Ernest J. Sylvester, and Lieutenant Bruce C. Zenk.In October the detachment was relieved from attachment to Headquarters Detachment, U.S. Army Support Command, Vietnam and attached to the 145th Aviation Battalion for rations and quarters. This involved a move of both officer and enlisted personnel into new quarters with the 145th Aviation Battalion. This resulted in an upgrading in living conditions which was appreciated by all.Although the evacuation of patients was to constitute the major workload for the unit, there was considerable workload in other allied areas. Aeromedical evacuation helicopters of the unit provided medical coverage for armed and troop transport helicopter during air assaults. As a result, the unit has been involved in every air mobile operation in the III Corps area, and in the IV Corps area until relieved of that responsibility by the 82nd MD (HA) in October. Medical coverage was also provided to aircraft engaged in the defoliation mission. This became almost a daily activity in the last few months of the year. Unit aircraft also became involved in many search and rescue missions. This often led to the depressing job of extracting remains from crashed aircraft.Early in the month of December unit aircraft and crews became engaged in airmobile operation and evacuation missions in the Bình Giã area which was southeast of Saigon. By the end of December operations in this area had expanded to near campaign proportions and unit aircraft were committed on nearly a daily basis. The end of the year 1964 was met with a sense of accomplishment by all unit personnel. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had performed well and accomplished much. The build-up, 1965–1967. By 1965, the mission of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was established as \"to provide medical air ambulance support within capabilities to U.S. and Free World Military Assistance Forces (FWMAF) personnel, and back-up service to Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) personnel as directed within III Corps Tactical Zone, ARVN 7th Division Tactical Zone within the IV Corps Tactical Zone, and back-up support for the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) operating within the II Corps Tactical Zone in coordination with the Commanding Officers of the 254th and 283d Medical Detachments (Helicopter Ambulance).\" Their responsibilities included:. Providing aeromedical evacuation of patients, including in-flight treatment and/or surveillance, in accordance with established directives, from forward combat elements or medical facilities as permitted by the tactical situation to appropriate clearing stations and hospitals, and between hospitals as required.. Providing emergency movement of medical personnel and material, including blood, in support of military operations in zone.Although the units supported, and the units they coordinated with, would change from year to year, the mission remained essentially unchanged until the detachment redeployed form Vietnam in 1973.. At the end of 1965, the detachment was awaiting approval of its request to be reorganized under TO&E 8-500D which would authorize six UH-1D helicopter ambulances and a corresponding increase in aviator and enlisted personnel. The 8-500C TO&E authorized only 5 aircraft.General Order Number 75, Headquarters, 1st Logistical Command, dated 13 December 1965, organized the Medical Company (Air Ambulance) (Provisional) and assigned the new company the mission of providing command and control of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) in the aeromedical evacuation support of counterinsurgency operations within the III and IV Corps Tactical Zones. The company was created in response to the obvious need for a command and control headquarters.The personnel authorized under TO&E 8-500C with Change 2 was augmented by General Order Number 143, Headquarters, U.S. Army Pacific, dated 31 July 1964. This augmentation increased the unit strength by three additional Medical Service Corps Aviators, MOS 1981, which brought the total authorization for the detachment to ten aviators. This allowed the detachment to meet the command requirement that each aircraft have two aviators aboard for each flight. This was considered essential in combat flying and especially so in Vietnam in order that one aviator would be available to take control of the aircraft. in the event the other was hit by enemy fire and was not a requirement in the continental United States when the UH-1 was fielded.Under the reorganization the detachment had pending on 31 December 1965, authorized aviator personnel would increase to eight rotary wing aviators, which would have to be augmented by four additional aviators to meet the command requirement of two aviators per aircraft. A proposed TOE Unit Change Request would be submitted upon reorganization which would increase the total number of authorized. aviators to fourteen, providing for a full complement of medical evacuation pilots plus a commander and operations officer.Enlisted personnel strength remained at a satisfactory level throughout 1965, which was considered an essential factor to the accomplishment of the unit\\'s mission. A full complement of qualified aircraft maintenance personnel and senior medical aidmen was constantly required as they participated in every evacuation flight.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain unit aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased load placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the influx of aviation units into Vietnam in 1965. Aircraft availability averaged 86% for the year.Air evacuation of casualties in the Republic of Vietnam was routine in 1965, as highway insecurity and frequent enemy ambushes along traveled routes prohibited evacuation by ground vehicles.The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury or from forward medical clearing stations. Initial treatment of the patient was normally affected by air ambulance crew and the ground unit\\'s medical personnel. This may have included bandaging, splinting, positioning, airway control, and the administration of a blood expander and/or pain-killer drug, as indicated. Treatment may have been rendered while in the pickup area or in the air. Crewmembers may also have had the task of assigning evacuation priorities in semi-mass casualty situations where a limited number of evacuation aircraft were available for the number of patients involved.Medical regulating for American patients had become well established with the induction of more qualified medical personnel and well-equipped installations. Patients may have been evacuated to brigade clearing stations, the 3d Surgical Hospital, 93d Evacuation Hospital, 3d Field Hospital, or the Saigon Navy Hospital as dictated by the nature of the patient\\'s wound and patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Surgeon, U.S. Army Vietnam and the Medical Regulating Officer, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese patients were evacuated to specific hospitals only as dictated by the initial location of the patient in relation to Saigon\\'s Cong Hoa Hospital and a Korean surgical located in Vung Tau. Degree of injury is a factor in medical regulating for Vietnamese patients only when the patient load includes killed in action, who were taken directly to the Tan Son Nhut ARVN Cemetery.During 1965, the major workload of the unit shifted from the support of the detachment\\'s secondary mission, which had generated the largest activity since the unit arrived in the Republic of Vietnam, to accomplishment of the primary mission, corresponding to the introduction in the Spring of large American combat units.USARPAC General Order 37, dated 25 February 1966, authorized the 57th Medical Detachment to operate under TO&E 8-500D. This authorized the detachment to augment this TO&E in three areas:. The addition of two 1/4-ton vehicles.. The substitution of the M16 rifle for the .45 cal. pistol as the new weapon used by the crew members.. The addition of six Warrant Officers.The addition of a Detachment First Sergeant proved to be invaluable. The larger UH-1D aircraft had vastly improved patient evacuation efficiency and crew safety. Carrying more patients on each flight reduced the number of patient transfers and field pick-ups otherwise required by the smaller UH-1B aircraft. Suggested changes to this TO&E were combined by the Helicopter Ambulance Detachments in the III Corps Tactical Zone and were forwarded along with justification by the 436th Medical Detachment (Company Headquarters) (Air Ambulance). A suggested change based on the 57th\\'s recent experience would include the addition of two medical aidmen to provide backup for the six aidmen already assigned to the Helicopter Ambulance detachments. Under the then-existing personnel allocations, when one aidman was sick or on leave, the First Sergeant or an aidman from an allied unit had to fill in for him.Problems encountered or areas of concern the detachment experienced included:. Area Coverage: Supported units did not understand the concept of area coverage. This term meant that a Dustoff aircraft would respond to an emergency by proximity and speed, and not necessarily in direct support of a specific unit. At the same time, the 57th was in favor of providing as much close-in direct support as possible when the tactical situation requires it, but not at the expense of the Area Coverage concept. In previous years in Vietnam, commanders had utilized Dustoff aircraft in accordance with this Area Coverage concept. However, there was a case under consideration at the end of 1966 which challenged this concept as compared to direct individual unit coverage. The consequences of this problem area became increasingly important as more and more units arrived in South Vietnam. It would be impossible to provide every major commander with an individual Dustoff and still efficiently meet mission requirements in the country. In addition, it was felt that Dustoff operations had been highly successful in the past, and that the 57th could continue to provide a high caliber evacuation system in the future, provided evacuations continue to be administered through medical channels.Hoist Missions: The S7th Medical Detachment had equipment and trained personnel capable of performing hoist missions when required. However, problems had arisen in this area which deserve mention here. On some occasions ground commanders had requested hoist missions in areas where a suitable landing zone was close by. At other times hoist missions were requested from an area suitable for a helicopter to land in. Also, the inherent dangers of this type of operation, for the aircraft, crew, and patients could not be overemphasized. In almost all cases, it was evident that continued emphasis was needed in this area, especially by ground commanders and individual requesters.Field Standby: The 57th routinely Supplied a field standby crew for the 196th Light Infantry Brigade at Tay Ninh, and on various occasions had provided crews to the 25th Infantry Division at Cu Chi, the 1st Infantry Division at Lai Khe, and the 4th Infantry Division at Dau Tieng. This close liaison support worked well during 1965, although at times the detachment had been over committed when combat operations (i.e. Operation Attleboro, etc.) required still additional ships in addition to those already at field standby locations. With the tremendous influx of additional units into Vietnam, this field standby support area was likely to become an acute problem in the future, unless the area coverage concept was fully accepted by the supported units.Early in 1966 the 57th relocated from the Tan Son Nhut Airport to the Saigon Heliport. This move was considered temporary, pending the final move to Long Binh Post, However, this temporary category extended for more than six months and resulted in many operational restrictions within the detachment, such as back-up reaction time and muster capability. As problems mounted with the construction of a heliport at the new location, billets and other facilities at Long Binh Post were erected by individuals of the 57th. It was anticipated that the move to Long Binh would be completed by mid-January 1967, all but eliminating the many problems that arose out of operating in the highly congested city of Saigon.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain unit aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased load placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the continued influx of aviation units into the Republic of Vietnam. Aircraft availability average for 1966 was 80.5%General supply support continued to be a problem because of the escalating numbers of U.S. Forces introduced into the combat zone.Air evacuation of casualties in the Republic of Vietnam was routine, as general insecurity and frequent ambushes along the traveled routes prohibited evacuation by ground.The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury or from forward medical clearing stations. Initial treatment of the patients were normally performed by the air ambulance crew and the ground unit\\'s medical personnel. This may have included bandaging, splinting, positioning, airway control, application of oxygen and the administration of a blood expander and/or analgesic, as indicated. Treatment may have been rendered while in the pick-up area or in the air. Crew members may also have the task of assigning evacuation priorities in semi-mass casualty situations where limited numbers of evacuation aircraft were available for the number of patients involved.Medical regulating for U.S. patients was well established by the end of 1966. Patients may be evacuated to brigade clearing stations, Surgical Hospitals, Evacuation Hospitals, and Field Hospitals as directed by the nature of the patient\\'s wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Surgeon, U.S. Army, Vietnam and the Medical Regulating Officer, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese patients were evacuated to specific hospitals according to the nature of the injury, proximity of medical facilities, and as directed by initial treatment facility.During 1966, the major workload of the detachment more than doubled from the patient load generated during 1965. In November, the 57th evacuated more than 1,000 patients for the highest monthly total since arriving in country This tremendous increase in patient load directly corresponded to the increase of American units and combat operations during the year.. The 57th Medical Detachment was organized under TO&E 8-500D implemented by USARPAC General Order number 37 dated 25 February 1966. This was changed by USARPAC General Order number 218, dated 26 October 1967, authorizing the unit to operate under MTOE 8-500D.From l January to 22 October 1967 the 57th was under the command and control of the 68th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade. From 23 October 1967 through the end of 1967 the 57th Medical Detachment was assigned to the 67th Medical Group under the 44th Medical Brigade.Field Standby: The 57th routinely supplied a field standby crew for 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Dau Tieng in 1967. This close liaison support worked very well during 1967 and continued to do so through the end of the year. At times the detachment had been heavily committed when combat operations (for example, Operation Yellowstone, Operation Manhattan, and Operation Junction City) required aircraft in addition to those already at field standby locations.The 57th Medical Detachment successfully completed a move from the Saigon heliport to Long Binh Post in February 1967. The heliport, billets, BOQs and other facilities at Long Binh were erected by the detachment personnel.The TO&E authorization of 14 aviators was considered adequate. However, the detachment did not have more than 11 aviators assigned at any time for more than short periods. During 1967 the detachment\\'s commitments steadily increased and with casualties and other unforeseen circumstances the assigned aviators were subjected to periods of extremely heavy workload. Although unit aviators did not accumulate high monthly total flying hours in comparison to other aviation units, the medical evacuation mission, (consisting of standby, 24 hours at a time, extensive night flying, periodic extended operations during mass casualty situations, and marginal weather) effectively limited the detachment\\'s ability to schedule a pilot for duty on a continuous basis.The 57th Medical Detachment received 6 UH-1H aircraft in December equipped with L-13 engines. The 1400 horsepower developed by this engine proved invaluable to the detachment\\'s crews when operating in small, confined areas in the jungle. All the aircraft were equipped with the Decca Navigator System.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain the detachment\\'s aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased workload placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the influx of aviation units into the Republic of Vietnam. Aircraft availability average for 1967 was an overall 74.8%.Medical regulating of U.S. patients continued to be well established in 1967. Patients could be evacuated to brigade clearing stations, surgical hospitals, evacuation hospitals, and field hospitals, as directed by the nature of the patient\\'s wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Medical Regulating Officers of the 44th Medical Brigade and 67th Medical Group effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.During 1967, the increase in the patient load continued to directly correspond to the increase of American units and combat operations during the year. Sustained combat operations, 1968–1969. Effective 16 February 1968, the detachment was released from the 67th Medical Group, and assigned to the 68th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, by General Order number 174, dated 14 February 1968. Also effective 16 February 1968, the detachment was attached to the 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance); 68th Medical Group, by General Order number 17, dated 1 March 1968. The transition was carried out smoothly and without major problems.The detachment operated under TO&E 8-500D throughout most of 1968. Reorganization took place under Department of the Army General Order number 542, dated 13 September 1968, authorizing the detachment to operate under MTO&E 8-500G effective 2 October 1968. Though it was too early as of the end of 1968 to tell, no foreseeable difficulties were expected under the new TO&E.In 1968, he 57th Medical Detachment provided coverage to U.S. and Allied Forces operating within their area of responsibility which included III Corps Tactical Zone and the northern part of IV Corps Tactical Zone. The detachment provided a standby crew for its home base at Long Binh Post where it was co-located with the 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance). In addition, it provided a permanent standby crew at Dau Tieng during the first half of the year; but lost this standby requirement and reverted to providing crews at Saigon, Tan An, Dong Tam and Phan Thiet on a rotational basis with the 45th during the last half of the year. Dustoff operations under this area support concept were extremely effective and were recognized as a tremendous morale factor to all combat troops operating in this area.The new 1968 TO&E changed the authorized Officer strength from 8 to 4, while the Warrant Officer strength went from 6 to 10. The detachment immediately dropped to 4 Officers to conform to the new TO&E, but with a continuing high quality of Warrant Officers obtained by the detachment, the change was not considered too drastic. Total authorized aviator strength remained at 14, but the detachment had only carried from 11 to 12 throughout the year. The authorized enlisted strength remained at 28, although some changes were made. The detachment gained 1 Senior Helicopter Mechanic, 1 Repair Parts Clerk, and 1 Equipment Records Clerk while losing 1 Aircraft Fuel Specialist, 1 Field Service Specialist, and 1 Radio Telephone Operator. With a large inflow of newly arrived personnel, the detachment was overstrength in enlisted personnel as 1968 drew to a close. All positions were filled throughout most of the year although some individuals were required to work outside of their MOS. This required some additional amount of on-the-job training and understandably caused some difficulties.The 57th Medical Detachment had six UH-1H aircraft which continued to be a tremendous asset toward accomplishing the detachment\\'s mission. They proved to be durable and highly capable in numerous combat situations. One aircraft was lost during the year due to an accident resulting from a tail rotor failure and was immediately replaced with a new aircraft. Aircraft availability for the year was an overall 76%. Supply and maintenance support, though at times slow, was adequate for the most part.Air evacuation of casualties proved itself in the Republic of Vietnam as a highly effective means of evacuating patients. The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury. Medical Regulations pertaining to the disposition of U.S. patients was well established by 1968. Patients could be evacuated to clearing stations, surgical stations, surgical hospitals, evacuation hospitals, or field hospitals as dictated by the patient\\'s wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination with the Medical Groups at the time of evacuation effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese civilian and military personnel could be evacuated to U.S. facilities depending upon the proximity of the various Vietnamese hospitals. Vietnamese hospital quality had improved over 1968 and greater emphasis was placed on evacuating Vietnamese casualties to those hospitals as they became more self-supporting. Life and limb saving procedures could still be undertaken at U.S. facilities if the situation warranted but the majority of those patients were then furtl1er evacuated to Vietnamese hospitals.Security of landing zones was generally very good but presented problems at times. Enemy capabilities could be underestimated, and it had to be stressed to ground units that even in areas where it may not have seemed necessary, such as \"friendly\" villages, especially at night. It is also worth mentioning that a brief but honest description of the tactical situation given by the ground commanders when applicable prior to landing of the helicopter could often be advantageous.The Tet Offensive of January - February 1968 tested the capabilities of the detachment to a maximum. The entire detachment met the challenge with determination. Five out of six aircraft remained flyable with the pilots and crews flying steadily on eight-hour shifts around the clock. Most of the time the crews changed without shutting down the aircraft, and during the entire crisis, the unit was able to perform its mission flawlessly.On 15 February 1969 the detachment relocated from Long Binh Post to Lai Khe, replacing the 4th Flight Platoon, 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) due to increased mission requirements in that area. From Lai Khe, it continued throughout the year to support elements of the 1st Infantry Division, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Forces operating in the area.Aircraft maintenance and supply support received from the 605th Transportation Company (Direct Support) was outstanding. Maintenance down time was drastically reduced by technical assistance visits and close maintenance coordination between the detachment and Direct Support element. The drawdown, 1970–1972. On 15 February 1970 the detachment relocated from Lai Khe to Binh Thuy to augment the Dustoff mission in the Military Region IV. From Binh Thuy the detachment supported the ARVN 9th, 21st Divisions and the 44th Special Tactical Zone, and the U.S. and Vietnamese Navies, plus U.S. Advisory Teams.The Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment also commanded the 43d Medical Detachment (RB) which provided ground ambulance support on an assigned basis. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was also under the operational control of the 57th.A strenuous effort was being made to get the VNAF to perform medical evacuation in Military Region IV. At the end of 1970, there were 3 squadrons of VNAF helicopters in Military Region IV; 2 fully active at Binh Thuy Air Base and 1 at Soc Trang. Senior VNAF officers and USAF advisors revealed a lack of expertise in the area of aeromedical evacuation. Tentative plans were made to provide ground schooling for selectec1 VNAF pilots and then furnish the VNAF with qualified aircraft commanders from the 57th and 82d Medical Detachments to fly combat missions with mixed crews. Considerable interest had been shown by both VNAF and USAF advisors in creating a special unit to conduct medical evacuations.Some of the problem areas were: Lack of a definitive direction through VNAF channels that the squadrons would perform the mission and the number of aircraft that needed to be tasked for the mission; lack of specific training? in medical evacuation in the VNAF; and communications problems from Military Region IV to the VNAF. At the end of 1970, one officer of the 57th was assigned to draw up training plans for the VNAF and also work on the communication problems.Aircraft maintenance and supply support received from the 611th Transportation Company (Direct Support) was not satisfactory. Excessive down time and equipment deadlined for parts rates could be traced directly to Direct Support, and higher supporting units.Updating of existing facilities continued with installation of finished walls, partitions and air conditioning of the detachment orderly room, supply, and operations. All buildings were of permanent type, of either wood or metal construction. Asphalt paving had been accomplished, and steel planking, 80 by 110 feet, had been installed in the aircraft maintenance area through the self-help program.. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was under the operational control of the 57th Medical Detachment until 1 November 1971 when the 82d was redeployed to the United States. The 43d Medical Detachment (RB), a ground ambulance detachment which had also been under the operational control of the 57th, was reassigned to the 3d Surgical Hospital in May 1971 for closer coordination of their mission.From 3 March 1971 to 1 November 1971 the 57th Medical Detachment trained Vietnamese Air Force pilots to perform medical evacuation in Military Region IV. Plans were drawn up out of a meeting with senior VNAF officers, USAF officers, and D.R.A.C. advisors, resulting in a ground school for the Vietnamese pilots and medical aidmen as well as the 57th flying combat missions with the Vietnamese. As of the end of 1971, classes were being planned consisting of a four-week course covering essential medical training for the Vietnamese pilots. The classes had a target date of beginning on 15 January 1972. The course was patterned after the four-week course of instruction being taught at Fort Sam Houston, Texas under the title \"Essential Medical Training for AMEDD Aviatiors.\"On 10 February 1971 the detachment extended their area of coverage to include the ARVN 7th Division in addition to the 9th and 21st Divisions and the 44th Special Tactical Zones already covered as well as the U.S. and Vietnamese Navies and U.S. Advisory Teams.The 611th Transportation Company (Direct Support) greatly improved their performance in 1971 over that demonstrated in 1970. During 1971 the 611th had been of great assistance to the detachment in every respect. They gave support not only at their unit facilities, but also provided on-site maintenance and technical assistance whenever it was necessary. They greatly aided the 57th in the accomplishment of the detachment\\'s mission.Aeromedical evacuation procedures. Night medical evacuation extractions became increasingly hazardous due to the Vietnamese field units not being equipped with necessary signaling devices, such as signaling flares, strobe lights, and so forth.The Vietnamese command structure was notified of the existing situation, but continued emphasis needed to be placed in this area.Essential signaling devices, and training in their use for night helicopter operations needed to be made available to units requesting medical evacuation. This problem could be alleviated by attaching specialists equipped to train and utilize this available equipment to various field units.U.S. and Vietnamese evacuation procedures. With the inception of the integrated flying and cross-training program on 3 March 1971, carried out by U.S. personnel, the program had progressed to the point where the Vietnamese Air Force pilots were accomplishing 85% of the ARVN missions in Military Region IV.The lack of both English-speaking Vietnamese and Vietnamese-speaking U.S. personnel provided a break of communications between the two forces in radio telephone operations section. The Vietnamese personnel sent missions incorrectly over the air, for example sending frequencies in the clear.The 57th recommended establishing a separate Vietnamese medical evacuation unit in Military Region IV. At the end of 1971, the necessary cross-trained Vietnamese personnel to establish such a unit were available. This would have served to alleviate communication difficulties and would allow for a separate operation to facilitate Vietnamese Dustoff operations.Classification of patients. As of the end of 1971, the Vietnamese radiotelephone operators were classifying the Vietnamese patients on a medical evacuation request as either urgent, priority, or routine. This classification was accomplished by word of mouth over the telephone without physically observing the wounded individuals.With the patient classification being made by detached personnel, many errors were made on the status or urgency of wounded personnel.All classifications should have been made by medical personnel or the senior ranking individual located with the wounded personnel. Command emphasis needed to be placed there to ensure a more exact classification procedure and, in most instances, speedier response for those who were truly urgent.U.S. Evacuation Procedures. Many valuable minutes were wasted by going to each U.S. Advisor location, picking up an interpreter (U.S. personnel plus Vietnamese interpreter) for each individual Vietnamese MEDEVAC request in the provinces. There were 16 provinces in Military Region IV with a minimum of four interpreter \"backseat\" pickups as many as twelve different locations depending on the province concerned. There was virtually no coordination due to a lack of parallel processing by the U.S. personnel of ARVN MEDEVACs.Missions ran too long due to the requirement to pick up an interpreter for each MEDEVAC where U.S. personnel are not on the ground. This could require picking up twelve different interpreters at twelve different locations for twelve different medical evacuations in a single province, to cite an extreme example.The 57th recommended that the ARVN establish a Vietnamese officer in charge of coordinating all Vietnamese Dustoff requests for each individual province. This solution would have provided one interpreter for pickup for each province for the MEDEVACs in that province. Coordinating the missions in each province would result.Establishing a formal Vietnamese dustoff unit. The 57th Medical Detachment had been working since 1 November 1070 toward the Vietnamization of Dustoff in Military Region IV. The following had been directed toward this end:From 1 November 1970 until 31 December 1970 ground school training was initiated for the Vietnamese pilots and their medics n the procedures of medical evacuation.On 1 March 1971 the flying program was initiated to test the ground school program initiated by the 57th. For eight months the U.S. aircraft commanders and medics flew over 4,000 hours with VNAF medics and VNAF pilots in order to standardize their approach to medical evacuation in the Mekong Delta. These figures do not reflect in the 57th\\'s overall total for all flying time and patients picked up were logged with VNAF statistics.From an operational standpoint the 57th had to coordinate and tactfully suggest and push for VNAF higher command support for the Vietnamese Dustoff effort in Military Region IV.Established Medical Classes—extending to a four-week indoctrination for VNAF pilots who fly Dustoff in order to provide unity to the effort among the Vietnamese pilots and provide impetus to their dedication.The 57th Medical Detachment loaned equipment and supplies when the Vietnamese Squadron continuously provided minimal support to their Dustoff effort.Through the efforts of the 57th and 82d Medical Detachments, results were tremendously successful, as illustrated by the fact that the VNAF completed 85% of medical evacuations in the Delta in December 1971.However, a formal VNAF Dustoff unit could not be created in Military Region IV due to the VNAF system of establishing priorities—that combat assault helicopters must be dedicated before Dustoff aircraft are provided.A letter was forwarded from the Military Region IV Commanding General to the Commander in Chief of the Vietnamese Armed Forces recommending a formal, dedicated Dustoff unit be created. This met with a negative response.Though the 57th received some support from the Vietnamese Air Force in supplying aircraft for the Vietnamese Dustoff pilots, emphasis needed to be continued to be placed on a dedicated Vietnamese Dustoff unit.As an added example, if the Vietnamese Air Force could produce the impressive mission accomplishment figures that they did in the last quarter of 1971 without an operations officer, without consistent guidance and support from the Vietnamese Air Force command structure then common sense allows for accurate prediction of future mission accomplishment if a formal dedicated Vietnamese Dustoff unit were established.In 1972, the 57th Medical Detachment was organized under MTOE 8-500G, as a six-aircraft, 45-man detachment. Ideally the detachment consisted of four Medical Service Corps Officers, ten warrant officers, and 31 enlisted. For the first three months of 1972 the detachment was based in the Mekong Delta at the Binh Thuy Naval Air Station, where the detachment provided medical evacuation support for Military Region IV. However, due to the dwindling U.S. and FWMAF evacuation mission and the increasing role played by the Dustoff crews of the Vietnamese Air Force, the 57th Medical Detachment was redeployed to Long Binh to join a sister Dustoff unit, the 159th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) on 1 April 1972 to form Long Binh Dustoff. These detachments served both Military Regions II and IV, with the 57th Medical Detachment maintaining a one ship standby site at the Can Tho Army Airfield. The two detachments functioned as one unit, with the senior detachment commander serving as the commanding officer. On 15 October 1972 the 159th Medical Detachment was inactivated, its colors returning to Fort Benning, Georgia and the 57th Medical Detachment was again redeployed, this time to Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon.From the beginning of 1972 until its redeployment to Long Binh Post, the 57th Medical Detachment was responsible for the training of Dustoff crews for the Vietnamese Air Force. Flying with American aircraft commanders, over thirty Vietnamese pilots were trained in this three-month period, becoming remarkably proficient in instrument flying, standardization, night flying, and tactical operations. During this same period the same number of Vietnamese medics and crew chiefs were also trained by the AMerican crew members on actual evacuation missions throughout Military Region IV. The achievement of the 57th Medical Detachment in this program, could not be overstated. As a result of this dedicated training the VNAF Dustoff crews were able to assume their responsibility for providing aeromedical evacuation assistance and support for the ARVN divisions in MR IV well ahead of a planned USARV Vietnamization schedule, thereby allowing the 57th Medical Detachment to redeploy to Long Binh Dustoff in time to offer additional strategic support to the allied forces embattled in the Easter Offensive in the Northwest part of Military Region III. As for the detachment\\'s own training, the 57th Medical Detachment was fortunate enough to have two fine instrument instructor pilots, one a military instrument flight examiner, assigned to the two detachments of Long Binh Dustoff. All of the pilots of the two detachments benefitted tremendously from the ground school classes and training flights conducted by these instructor pilots, but after several months the program was discontinued due to the lack of aircraft that could be made available for training purposes.Throughout the year, the availability of aircraft parts and related logistics became increasingly harder to procure, and at best the supply of such items could be termed only fair. Vehicle parts were harder to obtain, which often resulted in a low vehicle availability for the detachment.The two major problems that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment were again a result of the continuing de-escalation of the American forces in Vietnam.First, due to the dwindling number of missions, the newer pilots and enlisted crew members earned little flight time, thereby preventing them from becoming fully knowledgeable of an extremely large area of operations, as well as from becoming skilled in tactical flying and operations.Secondly, the aircraft direct support maintenance was contracted to a civilian organization, MHA Field Services. As the 57th Medical Detachment had a low priority for direct support maintenance, aircraft which would normally be grounded for three or four days by military maintenance teams for periodic maintenance and inspections were delayed for as long as three weeks. Nonetheless, the detachment\\'s own maintenance team was able to achieve an availability rate of approximately 85% despite this problem and the fact that aircraft logistical support was considered fair.A minor problem which continued to arise was the fact that POL stations (refueling points) for the aircraft across Military Regions III and IV were being closed down with the American withdrawal, and flight crews had to take special care to ensure their aircraft were properly refueled for each mission requirement. Inappropriate missions and the overclassification of patients remained continuing dilemmas. Redeployment, 1973. When it redeployed in March 1973, the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had qualified for all 17 campaign streamers that the Army had authorized for service in Vietnam.This section will explain the areas of stand-down, withdrawal and roll-up for the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance). Stand-down, as used here, refers to the events and procedures for terminating operations. Withdrawal, as used here, refers to the actual redeployment of personnel. The roll-up phase will cover the transfer or turn-in of unit property. Stand-down phase. Planning. With a negotiated settlement to the conflict in the Republic of Vietnam drawing near, the need for a replacement activity for Dustoff was recognized by the U.S. Army Health Services Group, Vietnam (USAHSVCGPV). A contract agreement with Cords Aviation was reached in early January for them to replace the four DUSTOFF units in Vietnam. It was decided that the Cords Aviation corporation personnel would assume the detachment\\'s mission in Military Region IV on X+30 and the mission in Military Region III on X+45. In connection with the Cords responsibilities and to assure a smooth transition, each of the DUSTOFF units would be required to contact their supported units and the Cords representative in their Military Region. The overall coordination responsibility was placed on the operations section of the 57th Medical Detachment.Taking into consideration the anticipated withdrawal and inactivation it was decided that a fifty percent posture on X+30 was appropriate. This fifty percent status would be reached gradually to insure complete and professional coverage of the detachment\\'s mission. On X+45 the detachment\\'s mission requirements would be terminated, and the remaining assets would be closed. The detachment\\'s field standby would be terminated in two steps. The daily standby in support of the air cavalry units in the 57th\\'s area of operation would be terminated on X-Day as the cavalry units completed their operation. The permanent Can Tho standby would terminate on X+30 as the Cords Aviation assumed the mission.A mission of great interest and importance was Operation Homecoming. This mission was the detachment\\'s single most important concern, as the intense international interest in the POW releases mounted. Early intelligence indicated the possibility of returnees being released in small groups in remote locations with little prior notice. The detachment\\'s leadership decided to place all personnel on twenty-four-hour alert as the treaty became effective. Each member of the detachment received complete briefings on their duty with concern to Operation Homecoming. As X-Day approached, further intelligence indicated the need to augment the aircraft of the detachment with ships and crews from the 247th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), located in Nha Trang. Coordination with the U.S. Army Hospital, Saigon was initiated for means of reporting and delivery of returnees.Actual events. The contract with Cords Aviation was accepted in late January 1973. Air Operations Offices for Cords Aviation were contacted in each Military Region by the respective DUSTOFF Operations Officers. The purpose of this coordination was to affect a smooth transitioning period, to eliminate possible problem areas and to better understand limitations that would be inherent to such a transfer. With this agreement it was then possible for the DUSTOFF units to proceed with the termination of operations as scheduled.The termination of the detachment\\'s field standby sites was carried out as planned. The Cavalry Troops in the 57th\\'s area ceased operations on X-Day as planned and so the detachment\\'s daily standby terminated with their requirement. The permanent standby in Can Tho terminated on X+30 as planned and an effective and smooth transition to Cords Aviation was made. As anticipated the withdrawal of troops justified the fifty percent posture on X+30 as planned, however a few problems were encountered (see withdrawal and roll-up phases, below). The fifty percent stand-down was accomplished a little behind schedule but proved appropriate as the detachment\\'s mission decreased sharply as the deactivation period continued. On X+45 the entire operation was terminated, and Cords Aviation assumed the mission with no difficulties.The 57th Medical Detachment\\'s role in Operation Homecoming was greatly diminished when the actual transfer was made. The two aircraft from Nha Trang arrived in Saigon on 27 January 1973 to augment the 57th Medical Detachment\\'s assets. Two ships were deployed to Can Tho to cover Military Region IV. On X-Day the entire unit was placed on 100% alert bringing to bear six ships with complete crews for the detachment\\'s area of operations. The detachment remained in this overreaction posture until X+10 when reliable intelligence was received to indicate the POWs would be released in large groups at a centralized point. The aircraft and crews from Nha Trang returned to base on X+12. During this same period of 100% readiness posture, a requirement was placed on the detachment for another ship and crew to remain on a three-minute alert at the heliport for Vice President Agnew\\'s visit to Saigon. This additional commitment required another crew to remain on the flight line twenty-four hours a day for the duration of the Vice President\\'s stay. The special crew for Mr. Agnew remained on the flight line, not leaving even for meals for four days. With the additional information available on Operation Homecoming and the special standby completed the unit return to normal alert rotation, that being one ship in Can Tho and two ships on alert in Saigon.When the first POW release was announced for 12 February 1973, the Detachment was briefed on its role. Since there was going to be a group released at a centralized point the headquarters element responsible for coordinating the operation decided only one Dustoff aircraft would be required. The remaining aircraft would be supplied by the 59th Corps Aviation Company. The detachment was also advised it would only be allowed a three-man crew, which was contrary to normal practices on any medical aircraft, but even over loud protests the three-man crew remained. The crew was chosen on 9 February 1973 and received extensive briefings from the operation commanders. At 0700 hours on 12 February 1973 the ship departed with the advance party for Loc Ninh for the release to take place.. After many hours of delay and bickering the contingent returned to Tan Son Nhut Air Base with the returnees at approximately 2100 hours. The Dustoff ship transported one litter patient, Captain David Earle Baker, USAF, the only POW that required immediate medical attention. The next POW release was scheduled for 27 February 1973 but due to difficulties with the major parties the release was delayed until 4 February 1973. The second release took place completely from Hanoi. With this release the detachment\\'s role in the POW releases was completed. Withdrawal phase. Planning. When an agreement to end the hostilities in the Republic of Vietnam was imminent a roster of tentative X plus date DEROS was published by the Commanding Officer. The X plus DEROS roster was compiled with the coordination of each section leader to consider mission requirements anticipated and projected strength levels as directed by higher headquarters. Anticipated requirements indicated a fifty percent posture by X+30 would correlate with operational requirements. The drawdown to the fifty percent posture would be made gradually beginning on X+15. The first individuals to be released would be composed of hard DEROS personnel. After the first group the remaining personnel would be released in groups of five as their usefulness or requirement decreased. At X+30 the unit strength would be twenty-two personnel. These twenty-two remaining individuals would then be retained until X+45 to fulfill the mission requirements. At X+46 the personnel in the final group would begin to depart as the unit continued to inactivate. Key personnel, including the Commanding Officer, Operations Officer, Maintenance Officer and Property Book Officer would remain until approximately X+51 to complete the detachment\\'s final closeout.Actual events. A great influx of personnel and the majority of the redeploying/inactivating units closing ahead of schedule caused initial planning changes to be made shortly after X-day. The detachment was required to amend its personnel rotation schedule to begin on X+29 with the fifty percent posture being reached at X+34. One aviator departed on X+10 as his normal Date of Estimated Return from Overseas (DEROS). On X+30 the departure of U.S. Forces was suspended because of the delay in the release of American POWs. Once again, the detachment\\'s release projections were revised and when the POW problem was resolved on X+35 the detachment\\'s personnel status was reduced to fifty percent. The remaining twenty-two personnel were retained until X+45 as previously planned. As the 57th\\'s mission terminated on X+45 the detachment released personnel in groups of four and five until by X+49 only four personnel remained to complete the final closeout. On X+51 the last four personnel reported to Camp Alpha for their return to the United States. Roll-up phase. Planning. The turn-in and/or transfer of unit property was set forth in Operation Countdown (OPLAN 215). According to the guidance received much of the unit property was transferred to the ARVN or RVNAF prior to the peace treaty becoming a reality. The physical transfer of the property going to the Vietnamese Forces would not take place until the treaty became effective and at such a time when the requirement for the equipment by U.S. Forces was non-existent. All items not covered under Operation Countdown were to be turned into the keystone facility at Long Binh Post. The unit\\'s aircraft physical transfer was under the direction of 1st Aviation Brigade G-4 section. The aircraft would be turned over to RVNAF with three being transferred by X+30. The remaining three ships would be physically transferred on or about X+45. All installation property had already been laterally transferred to the keystone processing activity prior to X-Day.Actual events. As directed in Operation Thunderbolt the appropriate equipment was transferred to ARVN and RVNAF forces prior to X-Day and hand receipted back to the detachment until the requirement for them no longer existed. Following directives from the 1st Aviation Brigade G-4 the 57th\\'s aircraft were held in the detachment until the RVNAF came to sign for them. Originally the direct support unit was going to act as a holding agent, but it was decided this would add unnecessary work and delay, thus the detachment dealt directly with 1st Aviation Brigade and the RVNAF for aircraft transfer. The first actual transfer of an aircraft was 16 February 1973 (X+19) when aircraft 69-15620 was transferred to the RVNAF. The problem in POW release caused a delay in the physical transfer of aircraft 68-15465 and 69–15223. The difficulties were resolved on X+34 and both of these aircraft were physically transferred on X+40. The remaining aircraft, 69–15278, 69–15296, and 69-15181 were held until X+45 to correlate with mission requirements. Three days were allowed for preparation and the remaining aircraft were turned in on X+49.All weapons, ammunition, and signal grenades were turned in on 1 March 1973 (X+3l). The M-16 rifles were turned over to ARVN forces with the hand receipt. All other weapons to include pistols and grenade launchers were turned into keystone, while the ammunition was given to the Long Binh Depot. All station property was turned in as requirements permitted. The majority of the office equipment was turned into the keystone facility by X+30. With the first turn-in of the station property keystone revised the detachment\\'s procedure. Instead of turning property in directly to keystone, who was acting as a holding agent, the detachment\\'s property was hand receipted to all AFT; the receiving agency. The remaining station property was then physically transferred on X+46. All unit property was turned in by X+49 and the final audit was completed on X+50. Support to XVIII Airborne Corps. Congress established the Military Aid to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program with an effective date of 1 July 1974. This program was designed to allow Army air ambulance units to provide aeromedical evacuation support to civilian communities where they did not compete with an established civilian air ambulance service. The idea behind the program was that it would increase aviator and crew proficiency in Dustoff units while at the same time provide a much-needed service to local civilian communities. The 57th began MAST operations shortly after the program was established.The mission of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) at Fort Bragg was to: Provide aeromedical evacuation of selected patientsProvide emergency movement of medical personnel and accompanying equipment and supplies to meet a critical requirement. Ensure uninterrupted delivery of blood, biologicals, and medical supplies when there was a critical requirement. Provide Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) effective 1 July 1974The above mission could be summed up as providing evacuation of patients at Fort Bragg, North Carolina to and from Womack Army Hospital and also to and from civilian hospitals within a 100-kilometer radius of Fort BraggThe 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) underwent significant changes to its MTOE due to the consolidated change to MTOE 08660HFC04 FC0176 with an effective date of 21 October 1975. The loss of one vehicle and trailer was felt to hamper the detachment\\'s ability to accomplish a rapid and efficient air-loaded movement.Of the total flight hours, 249.9 hours were performed for MAST missions in which 109 patients were evacuated.On 12 October 1980, the 57th Medical Detachment completed its one-thousandth MAST mission.On 12 April 1982 the 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized from an RA Team to an RG Team. The primary change in the reorganization was that its UH-1 Aircraft were replaced by UH-60 Blackhawks, with the first Blackhawk being received by the detachment on 15 June 1982. As it had been in the late 1950s, the 57th Medical Detachment was the first non-divisional medical evacuation unit to receive advanced aircraft—Eagle Dustoff of the 326th Medical Battalion having received the Army\\'s first operational UH-60 Air ambulance on 15 January 1982.On 12 February 1983, the 57th Medical Detachment was named runner-up in the U.S. Army Forces Command Commanding General\\'s Award for maintenance excellence.In June 1983, the detachment deployed to Egypt to participate in Exercise Bright Star.On 27 February 1985, the 57th Medical Detachment was again named runner-up in the U.S. Army Forces Command Commanding General\\'s award for Maintenance Excellence.Between 1 July 1974 and 1 March 1985, the 57th Medical Detachment completed more than 1,500 MAST missions in support of civilian communities in Virginia and the Carolinas.In January and October 1988, the 57th Medical Detachment provided aircraft and crews in support of Joint Task Force Bravo in Honduras.. On 23 December 1989, the 57th Medical Detachment deployed three aircrews to Panama in support of Operation JUST CAUSE. The crews deployed in support of the 214th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), which was permanently stationed in Panama, and were integrated into that organization\\'s operations. The detachment itself was not granted campaign participation credit for participation in Operation JUST CAUSE.In February 1990, the 57th Medical Detachment supported the deployment of aircraft and crews to Honduras in support of Joint Task Force Bravo.In August 1991, the 57th deployed to support Operation Green Stalk in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Operation Green Stalk was a counter-narcotics operation.. In June 1992 the detachment began receiving additional equipment from the 36th Medical Detachment at Fort Polk, Louisiana in preparation for the 57th\\'s upcoming reorganization.Two aircrews were deployed to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in August 1992 as part of Hurricane Andrew relief efforts.On 16 September 1992, the 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized and redesignated as the 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance). Although the previous air ambulance companies, dating back to the 1st Air Ambulance Company (Provisional) in the Koran War, had been composed of 25 ships, the new design was of a 15-ship company, with three 3-ship Forward Support MEDEVAC Teams and a six-ship area support team. Each team had the necessary maintenance and refueling capability to operate separately from the company for periods of time, a capability lacking in both the 25-ship company and the 6-ship detachment. And, once again, the 57th led the way, being the first air ambulance company to reorganize under the new structure.In January 1993, the detachment supported a deployment of aircraft and crews to Honduras in support of Joint Task Force Bravo.The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) began the 1998 with numerous external missions that required the company to provide additional MEDEVAC coverage to many geographically separated and remote areas.  The unit accomplished this mission by providing two UH-60A helicopters to Fort Stewart, Georgia in support of 3rd Infantry Division, one aircraft in support of the 5th Ranger Training Battalion, Dahlonega, Georgia and the continuous 24-hour MEDEVAC mission at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  In addition, the unit maintained two UH-60As with aircrews in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing support to the 4404th Air Wing (Provisional) at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) as part of Operation Southern Watch.In early January 1998, the unit was tasked to provide six aircraft and crews in support of Operation Purple Dragon, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The unit performed the mission flawlessly.  The month of March found the company conducting a C-5 loadout with a Forward Support MEDEVAC Team and then further deploying to the field for a Company FTX.  The loadout was conducted as part of the unit\\'s effort to remain trained in strategic air deployment activities.The company redeployed an FSMT (-) from Saudi Arabia in early July utilizing an Air Force C-17.  The utilization of the C-17 was an excellent opportunity for the unit to build load plans for the new aircraft.  The aircrews had barely returned from the long 14-month deployment when the FORSCOM ARMS arrived at Fort Bragg.  The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) performed magnificently as it received 2 of 3 FORSCOM Commander\\'s coins given for outstanding performance.  The unit received several commendable ratings and regained respect among the aviation units on Simmons Army Airfield.On 6 August 1998, the company conducted a change of command ceremony in which MAJ Harold Abner relinquished command to MAJ Scott Putzier.  The unit immediately moved into the planning stages for its first External Evaluation (EXEVAL) in over 5 years.  The unit conducted an EXEVAL train-up FTX in AUG as part of its support to the 82d Airborne Division, Division Support Command (DISCOM) Operation Provider Strike Exercise.  During the operations the company supported on one level or another all three Forward Support Battalions and the Main Support Battalion.  In September the unit conducted a defensive live fire on OP-9, a successful live fire concentrating on a perimeter defense.  Also in September the unit conducted a C-5 static load at Pope Air Force Base.  On 19 October, the order was issued, and the company began to prepare for its mission.  The EXEVAL included a C-5 loadout as part of the scenario prior to the conduct of the EXEVAL.  The EXEVAL, from 19 to 23 October, provided an excellent opportunity for the new commander to determine the company\\'s weak areas and develop a training plan for the next year.  The unit performed well in most areas and was granted credit for the EXEVAL by the 55th Medical Group Commander.. In November 1998, the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance), a sister company at Fort Benning, Georgia, deployed to provide humanitarian relief to several countries in Central America.  The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) was tasked to provide support to 5th Ranger Training Battalion-Dahlonga, GA, 6th Ranger Training Battalion-Eglin Air Force Base, FL, 3rd Infantry Division (M) at Fort Stewart, GA in addition to the 24 hour MEDEVAC support to XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.  Added to the unit\\'s tremendous workload in November was C,FSMT\\'s deployment to JRTC in support of 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division and the unit\\'s Initial Command Inspection for the new commander.The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) began 1999 with numerous external missions requiring the unit to provide aeromedical support to Fort Bragg, Fort Stewart, and the Ranger Training Battalions located at Dahlonega Georgia and Eglin Air Force Base Florida.The 57th Medical Company supported both Ranger Training Battalions for the first two months of the year while the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) recovered its personnel and equipment from their South America deployment.On 18 May 1999 the 57th Medical Company conducted Deck Landing Qualifications (DLQs) with the USNS Comfort off the North Carolina Coast, qualifying five aircrews, receiving tours of the ship, and providing the USNS Comfort\\'s deck crew and fire fighters emergency engine shutdown and crews extraction training.  This was the first time in over two years the unit had conducted DLQs on the USNS Comfort.August and September 1999 proved to be very busy deploying the FSMT (-) to Kuwait, fielding the ASIP Radio systems, and supporting an 82d Airborne Division Joint Readiness Training Center rotation.  The unit provided EFMB Evaluation and testing support to the 44th Medical Brigade EFMB in September running the Litter Obstacle Course and providing the aircraft and evaluators to the Evacuation Lane.  The EFMB Testing cycle was disrupted by Hurricane Floyd, which caused the evacuation of the unit\\'s aircraft at Fort Bragg and Fort Stewart.Hurricane relief efforts in 1999 involved the entire company as the unit flew 58 hours utilizing all available aircrews to include those Battalion staff members on flight status.  During the weeklong relief operation, the company provided continuous aircraft support to the disaster/flood area in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency operations which resulted in over 80 patients/individuals rescued or moved shelters.Within days of the hurricane relief operations ending, the unit again sent an FSMT in support of the 82d Airborne Division to the Joint Readiness Training Center that consumed most of the month of October. Operation Urgent Fury. The 57th Medical Detachment deployed to the Island of Grenada to participate in Operation URGENT FURY on 29 October 1983. The detachment would remain engaged in operations in Grenada in support of the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force until 30 October 1984. Operations Desert Shield/Storm. On 9 September 1990, the 57th Medical Detachment deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. Operation Uphold Democracy. The 57th Medical Company in the Global War on Terror. Casing the Colors. On 26 January 2007, as part of a reengineering of Army aviation, the 57th Medical Detachment conducted an inactivation ceremony at its hanger at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, named for Major Charles L. Kelly. The keynote speaker was Kelly\\'s son, Charles L. Kelly Jr. Although the unit would not be formally inactivated until 15 June 2007, this marked its end, as personnel and equipment were transferred after that, primarily to form Company C, 2d Battalion, 82d Aviation Regiment, 82d Airborne Division Fort Bragg North Carolina. Although most of the equipment and personnel transferred (as part of the conversion, the divisional MEDEVAC companies were organized as 12 ship companies instead of 15 ship companies), the lineage and honors of the 57th did not transfer to the new unit.

      "{'input': ' Meteorological history. A low pressure system formed on the northern Great Plains of the US, and started erratically moving eastward supported by high-level winds that were pushing cold air southward from the Arctic. By late January 25, the low pressure system had deepened and had been joined by a smaller disturbance from the U.S. Southwest to become massive in size and moved over the western Great Lakes, accelerated by a strong high pressure system to its west. Its leading edge moving at 100 mph (160 km/h)), it broadened into a cold front covering a large area of central North America from the Upper Great Lakes to the southern Appalachian Mountains, with cold wave warnings being issued for as far south as Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia.The low pressure system moved over the relatively warm Great Lakes and into Michigan, Southern Ontario and Upstate New York on January 26, drawing in moisture from the Lakes which, along with winds gusting as high as 70 mph (110 km/h), created blizzard conditions in the surrounding areas, with some areas receiving heavy snowfall. The front edge of the blizzard quickly moved into the St. Lawrence Valley and rampaged through northwestern New England and southern Quebec on January 27, dropping heavy snow, hail and sleet. Later on January 27, the storm had two centers—one over central Maine and the other over Quebec City—and its strength began to weaken in Maine before it moved into southern New Brunswick and then Nova Scotia. The southern portion of the cold front moved rapidly through the Central Appalachians and the Eastern Seaboard from North Carolina to Maryland the afternoon of January 26, creating winds up to 78 mph (126 km/h) for up to two days, together with variable precipitation, including hail, rain and, in parts of the Appalachians, snow.A second major but narrower snowstorm/low pressure system arose in North and South Dakota on January 28, brought snow to Iowa and Minnesota, and gained intensity as it briskly moved through Wisconsin, the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan, Southern Ontario, northwestern Pennsylvania, upstate New York and southern Quebec. It brought snow and high winds up to 60 mph (97 km/h), causing severe snow drifting and low visibility conditions, in some regions until January 30. As a result, certain areas, including Southwestern Ontario and the western half of New York, received snow and high winds for all or parts of five to six straight days, crippling those areas for the entire period, including shutting down schools and industries and stranding travellers. Overall impact. Neither of the storms are on the US National Weather Service\\'s (NWS) Regional Snowfall Index lists for the Upper Midwest, Upper Ohio Valley or Northeastern US, although, it must be noted, this Index focuses on snowfall and the size of population affected by snowfall whereas the greatest impact of these storms was their winds causing blizzard conditions and high drifts of snow, not uniformly high snowfall. Further, the areas of greatest snowfall were in Ontario in the leeward side of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, and in Quebec City area, both within Canada, which are not considered in the US Regional Snowfall Index.. While damage occurred due to high winds and private and public road transportation was severely affected in major urban centres such as Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Toronto and Buffalo, it was London with 68.6 centimetres (27.0 in), Quebec City with 54.1 centimetres (21.3 in), Rochester with 16.9 inches (43 cm), Syracuse, New York with 13.1 inches (33 cm), Ottawa with 29 centimetres (11 in), and Montreal with 26.5 centimetres (10.4 in) which had the most snow from five or six days of storm conditions. Smaller centres with the greatest snowfalls included: Paisley, Ontario with 127.6 centimetres (50.2 in) over a week, Oswego, New York with 22.1 inches (56 cm), Watertown, New York, with 18.8 inches (48 cm), and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with 17.5 inches (44 cm). . Some of the most severe impacts of the dual blizzards were on the London/Lake Huron Region of Southern Ontario, and most of Western and Central New York; in these areas blizzard conditions of less than a quarter-mile (400 m) visibility lasted for 32 and 29 non-stop hours, respectively, on January 26 and 27 resulting in the blockage and later closure of Highway 401 between London and various sections to its east at various times over two days and the complete closure of the entire New York State Thruway west of Utica for almost two days. Both freeways were formally closed again during the second blizzard on January 29. During both closures hundreds of people needed to find sudden overnight accommodation, such as at highway service centres, government buildings and hotels. Thirteen counties in New York banned all vehicular travel on roads and highways during the first blizzard, while numerous highways in Ontario\\'s Lake Huron Region were formally closed or totally blocked by snow for two to three days. Over 20,000 students in Ontario were not able to be transported home from school on January 26 and had to spend between one and three nights at their schools or billeted at homes in the communities; some schools boards kept some or all of their schools closed for four to six days because many rural roads were not fully cleared due to ongoing drifting of snow. Significant numbers of students and workers in the Rochester-area were also stranded overnight.. Many parts of Michigan also experienced completely blocked or closed roads and closed schools, as did much of Southern Quebec. In Montreal, blizzard conditions lasted 16 consecutive hours and the port was closed for January 27. Northeastern Ohio had thousands of people stranded due to the second blizzard and Interstate 90 in the adjacent area of Pennsylvania was closed for a time period. The second blizzard hit Wisconsin very hard resulting in five counties closing all their roads during that storm. All of the above areas pulled snow plows from their roads for extended periods due to absolute zero visibility conditions making collisions with marooned vehicles probable. Fatalities and injuries. At least 15 persons died in the US from the first blizzard. At least four fatalities were in New York, six in Michigan, two in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana, with a total of seven being traffic-accident related, two being heart attacks, one being train-related, one being a pedestrian struck by a car, and one person being trapped in their car. By January 28, there were reports of more than 50 injuries from the Midwest to New England from the first storm, which would include numerous injuries due to high winds in cities like Chicago, Cleveland and Cincinnati, some south of the blizzard zone.The second storm caused at least 19 fatalities in the US, six each in New York and Michigan, five in Wisconsin, and two in Pennsylvania.  Eleven of the deaths were by traffic accidents, four were heart attacks from shovelling snow, two pedestrians were hit by vehicles, one person died from exposure, and one person drowned.. In Ontario, six persons died from the first blizzard: two people were hit by cars, one died in a traffic accident, a fourth died from a heart attack when trying to dig his truck out of a snowdrift, and two died from exposure. During the second blizzard, three persons died in a car-tanker truck accident. In Quebec, six persons died from the first blizzard, two from heart attacks, two pedestrians were stuck by cars, one death was from a traffic accident and one death was train related.  No fatalities were reported in Quebec due to the second storm. Midwest U.S.. Wisconsin. The first storm system hit Wisconsin and northern Illinois late on January 25, dropping as much as 10 inches (25 cm) of snow on parts of Wisconsin, resulting in the closure of many schools for January 26. The second, narrower storm, which moved through on late January 28 and early January 29, three days after the first storm, mainly impacted southern and central Wisconsin with 50 mph (80 km/h) winds causing blizzard conditions which severely inhibited travel, cost five lives in traffic accidents—including a collision with a bus, a collision with a truck, a collision between a tractor-trailer and a salting truck, and a pedestrian being struck—and caused a 100-car pile-up on Interstate 94 in Hudson. Five countries declared all roads closed except for emergency vehicles and some pulled snow clearing equipment of the roads for a period citing them being a safety hazard for other vehicles in the zero visibility conditions and plows themselves ending up in ditches. Green Bay reported a temperature of −67 °F (−55 °C), taking into account the wind chill, although it escaped the worst of the snow and wind. Illinois. While snow largely missed Chicago, the city was hit with 50 mph (80 km/h) winds that blew out plate-glass windows of several downtown restaurants and stores, and damaged trees, traffic lights, radar equipment at O\\'Hare Airport, and power lines, leaving about 10,000 residents without electricity. The storm brought extremely cold temperatures, which when coupled with the high winds, produced a wind chill temperature of -55 Fahrenheit (-48 Celsius) in Chicago. Commuter rail from Chicago\\'s southeast was delayed up to 90 minutes by a freak accident in which high winds caused a string of empty coal train cars to roll down a grade in Burns Harbour, Indiana, smashing into a 91-car train, killing one crewperson and seriously injuring two others. Indiana. Beginning after dawn on January 26, the northern third of Indiana experienced near blizzard conditions, which deposited 6 inches (15 cm) of snow on South Bend, Indiana, over two days. Wind gusts of 50 mph (80 km/h) caused drifting snow which made many roads impassable and 60 schools boards across the northern Indiana closed their schools, most by late morning on January 26, and remained closed for January 27. In central Indiana, 60 mph (97 km/h) wind gusts raced through Indianapolis triggering over 200 false fire alarms, ripping the roof off a car dealership, and snapping utility lines, which cut power to thousands of households. Michigan. Beginning early on January 26, the storm inflicted blizzard conditions on large areas of Michigan—from its southern corners to the eastern Upper Peninsula of the state—with wind-driven snow creating zero-visiblity driving conditions on numerous highways and roads. In addition, numerous highways were blocked by snow drifts and, while the state\\'s three interstate highways remained open (aside from during crash clean-ups), only single lanes were able to be kept clear in some areas. Thousands of cars, trucks and school buses had to be abandoned in huge batches along freeways and other main roads, thereby stranding thousands of motorists. Thousands of schools across the state were closed on January 26.The blizzard hit the Upper Peninsula, including Sault Ste. Marie and the 13 counties of the northwest Lower Peninsula the hardest, dropping between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm) of blinding snow, leading authorities to close all highways and roads to all vehicles, including snow plows. All airports in the area, except one, closed for the day. Sault Ste. Marie received 8 more inches (20 cm) of snow on January 28–29 for a total of 17.5 inches (44 cm) for a five-day period. Cheboygan, at the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula, had such high winds coming off Lake Huron that there were 15-foot (4.6 m) snow drifts; everything—factories, schools, stores, offices—were closed for January 26 and all 6,000 residents stayed home for the day. On the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, 20,000 residents of Benton Harbor were without electricity, as the winds wreaked havoc on the power lines, while inland, the roofing on a building under construction  at the Grand Rapids airport was torn off. In some southwestern counties of Michigan, schools were closed from January 26 through the end of January 28 as snowfall and drifting snow continued into January 28, with total accumulations of snow over the three days approaching 15 inches (38 cm). A four-wheel drive military ambulance was used in Cass County to deliver medicine, food and fuel, to pick up marooned motorists, and to push cars from the roadway to permit plowing, while in adjacent counties snowmobiles were used for food deliveries. Metro Detroit area. Near Detroit wind gusts of 80 mph (130 km/h) ripped roofs from buildings, including the roof of a high school in Livonia, and blew people to the ground. In Northville, the winds blew over the Police Department\\'s 90-foot (27 m) communications antenna, which landed on the car of the chief of police. Detroit itself had consistent winds of 30 to 45 mph (48 to 72 km/h) with a peak of 55 mph (89 km/h), leading General Motors and Chrysler to close down four plants in the mid-afternoon, and requiring the cancellation or delay of most flights. City staff applied 2,500 tons of salt onto arterial roads that morning, but in most cases the winds blew the salt away and blew snow onto the roads. Four pile-ups of between 22 and 35 vehicles occurred, one on the I-96 included about five semi-trucks which left one person critically injured and several others hospitalized, while closing the freeway for six hours, and another on I-95 that left 13 persons injured. Oakland, reported greater than 100 traffic accidents before noon on January 26, and the other four southeastern Michigan counties reported the volume of accidents left their telephone switchboards overwhelmed most of the day. Statewide, the blizzard contributed to four deaths, two being traffic accident deaths, both from cars being rear-ended, and another, a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.The second winter storm brought 4 inches (10 cm) more snow to Detroit and much of Michigan\\'s Lower Peninsula three days later, on January 29 and early January 30. The storm featured fierce winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 km/h) and blizzard and near-blizzard conditions in various urban areas, which slowed the evening rush hours to a crawl and again left many abandoned vehicles dotting the sides of major freeways. Hundreds of people had to spend hours or the night in makeshift accommodation, including the occupants of 200 cars blocked in a six-mile stretch of US Route 131, who bedded down in an American Legion Hall, private homes, buses and all-night restaurants. At least five people died in Michigan from the traffic accidents from the second storm, one a pedestrian, and one person died from exposure. Ontario. The dual blizzards affected virtually all areas of Southern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario causing the blockage or closure of dozens of highways and other roads and closing most schools for a day or more. Hardest hit was the London and Lake Huron Region of Southwestern Ontario where cities and towns were completely isolated for two or more days. Five Ontarians died from the blizzard on January 26: two people were hit by cars, one died in a traffic accident, a fourth died from a heart attack when trying to dig his truck out of a snowdrift, and a fifth died from exposure from trying to walk 6.3 km home. Another person was found dead from exposure on January 27. On January 29, during the second storm, three persons were killed in driving snow near Hamilton when a car slammed into a jack-knifed tanker truck. One person from Huron County was trapped in their car for 35 hours after sliding off the road into a snow bank on January 26, after which more snow fell on top of it, but was freed without severe injury. Northeastern Ontario. The blizzard\\'s first arrival in Ontario was in Sault Ste. Marie the evening of January 25 when it brought blowing snow and reduced visibility (about 1 kilometre [0.62 mi]) overnight and 17.3 centimetres (6.8 in) of snow over two days. More than 66 schools in the area were closed on January 26. Subsequent storm systems lashed the city over the next three days, with January 27 and 28 each having several hours of blizzard conditions (in Canada defined as visibility of 400 metres [0.25 mi] or less), and in total, dropping 27.5 centimetres (10.8 in) snowfall. January 28 and 29 saw 110 traffic accidents in Sault St. Marie.The remainder of Northeastern Ontario was hit by the blizzard around dawn on January 26, with winds gusts as high as 108 km/h (67 mph) causing heavy drifting, sometimes as high as 1.5 metres (4.9 ft). Sudbury saw 22.4 centimetres (8.8 in) of snow, average winds of 82 km/h (51 mph) and had 12 hours of whiteout conditions with 0 or less than 200 metres (0.12 mi) of visibility. Some school buses were stuck in the snow that afternoon (and remained stuck 2 days later) such that many students in the Sturgeon Falls area did not get home until 10 p.m. One family of five spent 22 hours trapped in their car stuck in a snow bank about 110 km (68 miles) northwest of Sudbury, while 58 pupils were trapped at school overnight north of Kirkland Lake. As it was too dangerous for snow plows to operate during the white-out conditions, most roads were still clogged the next morning meaning school buses had to be cancelled; as a result most schools were closed by noon. Aside from Highway 17 running eastward from North Bay to Ottawa, virtually all major and secondary highways in the region, including those running south through Central Ontario, were undrivable until late in the day on January 27, meaning no intercity car or bus transportation could occur; all flights were also cancelled. In Kapukasing, the wind chill was measured as −61 °C (−78 °F) and caused the cancellation of mail delivery. London and Lake Huron region. Blizzard conditions lasted all or parts of six days and dropped upward of 60 centimetres (24 in) of snow in the London and Lake Huron Region of Southwestern Ontario. The first blizzard initially struck areas on the east (leeward) side of Lake Huron around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 26—in Sarnia and elsewhere along the coast, heavy snow and high winds caused visibility to rapidly decline from several kilometres to 0 metres. By noon, the blizzard, with winds of 58 km/h (36 mph) gusting to 101 km/h (63 mph), had penetrated inland—in London visibility was reduced to 200 metres (0.12 mi) by noon, and by 5:00 p.m., it had dropped to virtually zero, where it would remain for 23 consecutive hours until 4:00 p.m. on January 27, a total of 32 straight hours of blizzard conditions (400 metres [0.25 mi] and less visibility). All areas north of London, east of Lake Huron, and west of Kitchener also experienced such conditions, although in most cases marginally less severe and for shorter duration.The blizzard pummelled London with 45.6 centimetres (18.0 in) of snow over 2 days, Woodstock with 40.9 centimetres (16.1 in), Exeter, 50 kilometres (31 mi) north, with 48.3 centimetres (19.0 in) and Paisley, 40 kilometres (25 mi) southwest of Owen Sound, with 40.7 centimetres (16.0 in). Areas on the eastern fringes of the Region, while subjected to blizzard or near-blizzard conditions on both days, had less snow, such as 20.7 and 10.4 centimetres (8.1 and 4.1 in) total in Mount Forest and Kitchener, respectively. . Brantford, on the southeastern edge of Southwestern Ontario, experienced 41.1 centimetres (16.2 in) of snow from the first blizzard, the furthest easterly city in the province to receive such a high amount. Except for northern communities, such as Paisley, which received 16.3 centimetres (6.4 in) of snow, and Wiarton getting 6.6 centimetres (2.6 in), snowfalls were minimal on January 28, but most areas still had significant winds and blowing snow, causing reduced visibility in the range of 1 km for much of that day.On Friday, January 29, the second blizzard, with wind gusts up to 85 km/h (53 mph), struck the Region, dropping between 15.5 and 20.3 centimetres (6.1 and 8.0 in) of snow on most areas over two days, although northern areas received up to double that. Most sections of the Region experienced periods of blizzard or near-blizzard conditions on January 29, the fourth straight day of blizzard-like conditions, and reduced visibility conditions on January 30. The winds, and hence, the blowing snow, eased somewhat on January 31, the sixth day since the first blizzard began, although all areas still experienced frigid temperatures approximating −15 °C (5 °F), taking into account the wind chill, plus received still more snow—4.8 centimetres (1.9 in) in London, 11.9 centimetres (4.7 in) in Wiarton and 9.7 centimetres (3.8 in) in Paisley. Paisley received a further 15.7 centimetres (6.2 in) on February 1, meaning over a seven-day period it was pummelled with 127.6 centimetres (4 ft 2.2 in) of snow. The blizzards dumped 67.5 centimetres (26.6 in) on London, 68.6 centimetres (27.0 in) on Exeter and 79.8 centimetres (31.4 in) on Wiarton over the period, and drifts of snow were far higher. Highways impassable. In the London/Lake Huron Region, most provincial highways and county roads became blocked by snow within a few hours of the blizzard ascending, and the dangerous low visibility prompted the provincial Department of Highways to remove its snow plows from the highways. Highways west of Stratford (4, 7, 8, 19, 23, 83) remained blocked through January 27, and even once they were plowed, snowfall and snowdrifts would refill the plowed sections. Highway 21 near Amberly, with \"mountainous drifts\", was only cleared on January 30 after crews spent over two days working to clear all the snow. Near the intersection of Highways 7 and 22 between London and Sarnia, there was a \"miles\"-long collision of trucks, cars and police cruisers which had started around noon January 26 and just kept growing as more vehicles plowed into each other and into ditches over several hours. In Perth and Huron counties, several communities, including Goderich and Wingham, were still almost totally isolated when the second blizzard struck on January 29 and blocked all highways and roads even further, some with 3.5-metre (11 ft) snow drifts. Even highways that were kept open during the second blizzard, were only open for a single-lane of traffic, and drifting snow continued for up to three days after. Highway 8, the major highway to Goderich on the Lake Huron shore, was not fully cleared until February 1.Numerous OPP and municipal police cruisers got mired in snow drifts and frigid cold winds forced officers to seek shelter in restaurants or nearby homes alongside other members of the public. Considering that any driving in the zero visibility conditions risked collisions, most OPP detachments and some local forces pulled their cruisers from roads for most of two days aside from for emergency calls and many did the same on January 29–30 when the second blizzard hit.On January 26 and 27, Highway 401 connecting London to Woodstock, Kitchener and Toronto was blocked at numerous points and littered with abandoned cars, many from chain-reaction accidents of 20 or more cars. With other highways and other transportation modes also inhibited by the blizzard, London and Woodstock were completely cut-off from the rest of the province. Its worst section was near the exits for London where the OPP estimated there were hundreds of collisions. Late on January 27 they began diverting vehicles onto other highways to detour that stretch; the stretch was closed again during the second blizzard. The Premier of Ontario was being driven to London on January 26 and ended up spending that night and much of January 27 at the service centre near Ingersol, just east of London, along with about 350 other stranded people. He and his driver finally got a lift to London in an airport bus, but his driver ran in front of the vehicle part of the 5-hour crawl to avoid their hitting other cars in the absolutely whiteout conditions; many people were trapped at the service centre for two nights. The Woodstock Snowmobile Club was patrolling Highway 401 to pick up stranded motorists and deliver them to service centres or hotels.Intercity bus service was drastically delayed before being totally suspended; two buses from Toronto arrived 17 hours late after being stuck in snowdrifts only 10 km from London for 9 hours, having picked up several stranded motorists along the way. Most airports in Southern Ontario were also closed most of January 26 and 27, so the only transportation mode running reasonably through most of Southern Ontario was the train, but even those were running up to three hours behind schedule and one train derailed after hitting a drift east of Kitchener, injuring three passengers and closing the northern main passenger line. A Canada National Railway snow plow train also got stuck in snow drifts north of London stranding its crew. Rural areas isolated. In the Lake Huron Region, most county snow plows were called off the road by the afternoon of January 26 due to the complete whiteout conditions. Numerous people were stranded overnight, or sometimes as long as 2 or 3 days, at whatever building happened to be closest to them when their motor vehicle got stuck in the snow—meat shops, restaurants, strangers homes, farmsteads, churches, Legion Halls. A hotel in the Village of Lucan hosted 240 persons in its 60-person capacity building. At the Bruce Nuclear Power Development near Tiverton, 1,400 persons were isolated for over three days before roads could be cleared and then two buses carrying 75 of them got stuck in snow drifts in nearby Kincardine and the remaining 1,300 persons spent another day at the site. Attempts had been made on January 28 by the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) to deliver food by helicopter but snow squalls had arisen that caused the plan to be aborted.The high wind gusts wreaked havoc with electricity lines, causing fifty different areas in the London/Lake Huron Region to suffer blackouts. In Bruce County, wind gusts of up to 160 km/h (99 mph) caused a blackout to most of Bruce County and the southeastern part of Grey County for about an hour. With the power off for a number of hours or longer in many rural areas, hundreds of farmers had to milk their cows by hand, and, as their electric milk storage facilities were not operating and the milk could not be delivered to dairies due to the impassable roads, thousands of litres of milk had to be discarded. Even when the electricity was restored, with the impassable roads blocking delivery to users and their storage systems customarily only holding two-days\\' production, many farmers still needed to dump large quantities of milk. Snowmobiles were used to take hydro crews out to fix downed lines—some sources asserted that by the forenoon of January 27, only 800 homes across Southwestern Ontario were without electricity but other sources state \"thousands were stranded for days ... without heat or hydro.\" At least 200 homes near Clinton were without power from near the start of the blizzard until January 28, at which time helicopters were used to airlift in repair crews. On January 28, the CAF used four helicopters and three Otter aircraft equipped with skiis to conduct an aerial search of the entire snowbound countryside north of London to ensure there were no people from stranded vehicles trapped or lost in the countryside; no such persons were found. There were reports of truckloads of chickens, turkeys and pigs being frozen to death because livestock transport trucks became marooned.On January 28, snowmobilers rescued a couple near Port Elgin who had been without heat or hydro since January 26. On January 29, many towns and villages were still mostly isolated, with stores and factories still closed, and police were posted at their edges advising people it was unsafe to drive into the snow-drifted countryside. Snowmobile clubs in Hanover, Port Elgin, Southampton and other areas worked with the police 24-hours a day to aid in emergencies, including delivering food and fuel to isolated farms, transporting medical patients to medical facilities, and delivering medications. Snowmobilers also delivered food and blankets to various places where people were stranded. The continued high snow falls in northern areas, such as Paisley, meant even snowmobilers had difficulty making deliveries in the deep snow by January 30. \"It was universally acknowledged that the local snowmobilers saved the day delivering almost whatever was needed to wherever people were stranded.\" Students marooned and schools closed. About 20,000 students in the London/Lake Huron Region, mostly rural students who took buses to school, ended up being marooned at their schools or, if their school was in a town or city, billeted in nearby homes—sometimes friends or relatives, but often just volunteers—the night of Tuesday, January 26 and, in many cases, for one or two nights beyond that. Weather forecasts had not predicted the strength or duration of winds in the Lake Huron Region, so school administrators were mostly taken by surprise, resulting in different school boards and individual schools taking different approaches. In the following days, the Goderich Signal Star stated \"why were they [schools] not closed before or at noon on Tuesday?\"Some principals arranged for the school buses to come and take students home in the late-morning or early-afternoon, but in many cases, due to driving visibility soon dropping to only a few metres, the drivers had to abort the runs and return to the schools. In some cases, the buses got marooned on the way to or just outside the schools, while a small number of buses got marooned partway through their routes, forcing drivers and students to take refugee with farmers. In some cases, children walking to their buses were blown away by the ferocious winds, illustrating they should stay at the school. Some school boards held off buses for a few hours gambling that the blizzard conditions would weaken by mid- or late-afternoon, while at other schools, principals contemplated early dismissals but parents phoned saying it was too dangerous for that, so they waited hoping conditions would improve, but as that did not materialize, by mid- or late-afternoon plans for everyone to stay overnight were formulated. Bruce and Grey counties, which are closer to the Georgian Bay area covered by a storm warning and upon which the blizzard ascended later in the day, were able to get all but 880 students home that day.In the towns and cities, it was often high school students who were stranded in-town; most were billeted with residents, with some being transferred from high schools to billets during the day January 27. In the Town of Clinton, population of about 3,000, 600 secondary school students were billeted in volunteer\\'s homes. For pupils staying overnight at elementary schools in small settlements or on isolated rural roads, food was a substantial concern; in a separate school north of Lucan, the food supply was dangerously low for the 270 students by January 27, as the stores in the village ran out of milk and bread and almost all food—but snowmobile caravans delivered food from various sources to that school and many others, in addition to some farmers delivering eggs by tractor. The next day, the CAF, with heavy-duty trucks and a tracked armoured-personnel carrier, were able to forge through the drifts to replenish Lucan with supplies. At a school in the village of Brucefield, where 600 students and 24 teachers were marooned for 55 hours, soup, crackers and 20 cases of pop brought by snowmobile from two local stores, plus 160 loaves of bread from two bread trucks that were stranded in the village, became first few meals for the throng. Schools used drapes from windows or stages as blankets and gym mats, hall runners and carpeted floors as mattresses. Large numbers of blankets, loaned from hotels or hospitals or villagers, medical supplies or even doctors were delivered by snowmobile caravans or by CAF tracked-vehicles or helicopters.By early January 28, the greatest obstacle to getting pupils home became snow-blocked roads, and achieving that goal often required detailed coordination, including students being delivered by buses as far as the roads were clear, such as to a specific store, and then being transported by snowmobiles to their actual homes on severely drifted concession roads. One school bus travelling to pick up students on January 28 crashed into an obscured car abandoned in the middle of the road. In some cases, CAF tracked-vehicles transported children to their homes. The morning of Friday, January 29, about 5,000 students in the Lake Huron Region were still stuck at their schools, but aside from a few isolated cases, all were transported to their homes before that night for the weekend despite the fact the second blizzard struck that day.In rural parts of Perth, Huron, Bruce and Grey countries, schools remained closed until Tuesday, February 2 or Wednesday, February 3 due to impassable secondary roads blocking access to the schools and precluding school buses operating, while in the rural portions of Middlesex (outside of London) most reopened on Monday, February 1. In the towns and cities of those counties, schools were open by January 28 or 29 to in-town students who could walk to them. In the Kitchener and Brantford areas on the eastern edge of Southwestern Ontario, Waterloo County schools were closed until Monday, January 31 due to higher winds in Kitchener causing drifting snow on January 26, 28 and 29, whereas Brant County schools reopened January 28, despite the fact the area had substantially more snow on January 26–27. London paralyzed. The snow in London was so deep by the end of the day on January 26, that arterial roads downtown and elsewhere were completely jammed with stuck cars, and when heavy machinery was called to move the cars, that machinery also got stuck. Four cars were found stuck on railways tracks so the railway had to be called to hold the trains. At 8 p.m., the visibility was so minimal there was such a strong danger of plows hitting marooned cars that London pulled the plows off the road. The Mayor of London declared a state of emergency, with the rationale that it allowed the CAF to provide assistance and the use of its vehicles. The CAF provided 180 personnel and 20 vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, four-wheeled drive jeeps, a three-ton ambulance, a 17-passenger tracked-vehicle and six tracked-army personnel carriers, most for their own usage in the entire Region, such as for transferring sick persons to medical facilities, but some for loan to the City of London. London police also used four-by-four vehicles loaned by citizens to get around, such as transporting those in medical need or searching marooned cars for occupants. Soon after the blizzard hit London, buses were pulled from the road as the snow was falling faster than plows could clear it. In downtown London, a two-horse open sleigh provided public transportation. London\\'s buses were also unable to operate on January 27 but returned to full service on all but a few residential routes on January 28 as city plows worked all night January 27–28 to make most streets passable.Even in the City, numerous factories had to find accommodation for workers who were unable to drive or take transit home on January 26 and most factories and businesses were completely shut down for two to three days. Classes at all universities and colleges in London were cancelled until the snow emergency was over. London\\'s three radio stations gave non-stop reports of weather conditions and the situation around area for two to three days; they allowed phone calls on the air so people could communicate emergencies or other needs which other people in the area could often help solve. Due to the exceeding high volume of telephone calls because people throughout Southwestern Ontario were calling others to divulge their whereabouts, service the afternoon of January 26 in London, Brantford and other centres was on partial delay at times, meaning people heard a short dial tone and had to wait until later to attempt a phone call. London\\'s Courts and City offices were closed for two days but were in operation on January 28. Greater Toronto Area. The blizzard hit Toronto for two to three hours as the afternoon rush hours were commencing. While only between 4.6 and 9.1 centimetres (1.8 and 3.6 in) of snow fell between then and the next morning, the consistent winds of 50 km/h, gusting to 84 km/h, created areas in the central and northern Toronto with zero visibility while other areas had about 400 metres (0.25 mi) visibility. Hundreds of accidents occurred per hour for several hours, including numerous jack-knifed transport trucks, a 32-car pile-up, and several eight- or ten-car chain-reaction collisions, completely clogging the Don Valley Parkway, Highway 401 and the arterial roads.A 19-vehicle collision started by a school bus hitting a transport truck, necessitated the closure of those freeways for two hours, partly to enable sanding and salting. Hundreds of drivers were trapped and many abandoned their cars in frustration or because they ran out of gas, so even after the freeways were reopened they were described by the OPP as \"parking lots.\" One person was killed when hit by a car and 20 people suffered injuries, two severe, in various accidents, the total of which surpassed all previous storm events in Toronto. Buses were drastically slowed, resulting in several thousand subway riders having no buses to get on when disembarking the northern end of the Yonge Subway line—to avoid overloading the passenger platforms, subway trains holding over 1,000 people were paused from unloading. The second storm created poor driving conditions, including reduced visibility (to between 800 and 1,200 metres [0.50 and 0.75 mi]) for several hours again the evening of January 29 with snowfalls of between 6.6 and 9.8 centimetres (2.6 and 3.9 in), but accident numbers were not substantial. Remainder of southern Ontario. Windsor, in the far end of Southwestern Ontario, only received 4.8 centimetres (1.9 in) of snow, but wind gusts up to 100 km/h (62 mph) meant it experienced near-blizzard conditions much of January 26 with two hours of blizzard conditions. Chatham to east of Windsor, had similar amount of snow, but the winds gusting to 112 km/h (70 mph) whipped snow into drifts, caused the suspension of all buses in the area, blew in some windows and blew down some electricity and telephone lines. The second storm dumped 10.4 centimetres (4.1 in) of snow on Windsor on January 29 and brought winds that  created visibility as low as 800 metres (0.50 mi); results included at least 57 accidents in one day, numerous cars landing in highway ditches or being abandoned from being struck in snowbanks, plus 1,500 homes losing electricity.The Hamilton area\\'s highways and roads was significantly impacted by the blizzard on January 26 as, although the area received less snow (3.0 centimetres [1.2 in], it had only 200-metre (0.12 mi) visibility from early afternoon until evening. The remainder of the Niagara Peninsula was not hit as heavily by the blizzard, with St. Catharines and Welland receiving 10–11 centimetres (3.9–4.3 in) of snow, the bulk of it on January 27 when wind speeds were lower. Hamilton received a further 11.0 centimetres (4.3 in) of snow from the second storm system beginning late in the evening on January 29. Central and eastern Ontario. In Central Ontario to the east of Georgian Bay, 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) of snow was deposited on January 26 with a further 25.7 centimetres (10.1 in) dumped on January 28–29. Wind-driven snow kept snow plows off the roads for much of January 26 and 27 and Highway 400 was littered with hundreds of abandoned vehicles. A 20-car pile-up occurred on Highway 400 just south of Barrie which was formally closed soon after, as were most other highways in the area. Hundreds of students in Barrie and the surrounding Simcoe County were stranded at their schools overnight and the Governor-General of Canada was marooned in Orillia after his official train was snowbound in nearby Parry Sound.In Eastern Ontario, an advance wave of the storm created near-blizzard conditions (400 metres [0.25 mi] visibility) in Ottawa the morning of the January 26, and then reduced visibility (800 to 1,600 metres [0.50 to 0.99 mi]) all day on January 27 with wind gusts as high as 95 km/h (59 mph); the city received 19.8 centimetres (7.8 in) of snow. Traffic on Ottawa\\'s expressways slowed to a crawl at rush-hours on both days, with one expressway closed for six hours, and snow-blocked roads pre-empted school buses, leading to school closures in most rural areas across the district for up to three days. Highway 401 had numerous cars in its ditches and was closed for ten hours near Cornwall due to a multi-tractor trailer collision. Ottawa received 10.2 centimetres (4.0 in) more snow on January 29 and 30 with some strong winds but impacts were minimal as the strongest winds were overnight. Kingston which experienced some blowing snow and 6.9 centimetres (2.7 in) of snow over two days, escaped the worst of the first storm, although Picton to its west had higher levels of drifting snow, resulting in schools being closed for one day. From the late afternoon of January 29 to early morning of January 30, the second storm hit  the Kingston area causing near-blizzard conditions (with two hours of blizzard conditions) and 9.7 centimetres (3.8 in) of snow, with drifts up to 1 metre (3.3 ft); on Highway 401 in Gananoque a 12-vehicle pile-up occurred. Ohio. Northeastern Ohio. The blizzard—that status verified by the National Weather Service (NWS)—enveloped northeastern Ohio beginning late morning January 26, with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of snowfall, on average—although some areas east of Cleveland received up to 12 inches (30 cm)—being blasted into cars\\' windshields by winds between 80 and 100 mph (130 and 160 km/h). There were several multi-car collisions including ones of 13 and 15 vehicles, and the American Automobile Association (AAA) reported close to 350 calls for assistance between the morning of January 26 and noon on January 27, some because clients\\' car batteries were dead because of the bitter cold or their cars stalled due to the high winds blowing their engine blocks full of snow. The speed limit on the Ohio Turnpike was lowered from 70 to 40 miles per hour (113 to 64 km/h) and trailers were banned. Two thousand people were stranded in Cleveland overnight due to the treacherous driving conditions. Schools were closed throughout the region for two days as was Kent State University.In Cleveland, gale-force winds of close to 98 mph (158 km/h) caused widespread damage: windows were blasted out in several office buildings cutting a large number of people; 11 different parts of the area were left without power due to damaged power lines; and some construction equipment was blown over, blocking streets, and forcing the evacuation of an office skyscraper in case equipment from a neighboring skyscraper might be blown into that building. The high winds tossed people around, prompting many downtown to form human chains linked to light poles to prevent people from being thrown into automobile traffic; despite that dozens of people required hospital treatment from falls.In Akron icy pavement—the extreme cold, prevented salt applied by road crews from melting any of the ice—and blowing snow caused numerous vehicle collisions and dozens of cars to slide into ditches, the result being massive traffic tie-ups which blocked all four expressways, plus several other major roads during the morning and afternoon rush hours. Police had to access the accident sites on the expressways by using motorcycles and entering via the wrong way using exit ramps. In all, 95 traffic accidents were investigated in Akron by police on January 26, although few happened in the evening as few motorists ventured onto the roads. Southern Ohio. In the Cincinnati region, while there was minimal snow, winds gusting as high as 60 mph (97 km/h) made motorists hold their steering wheels tightly to resist winds directing their cars off the roads or into the paths of other vehicles. On Interstate 75 to the north, near Dayton a tractor trailer-rig was blown onto its side by a gust. The winds in Cincinnati also tossed garbage cans, knocked down wires and tree limbs, blew off portions of several roofs, levelled a partially built warehouse, blew permanent signs over, and shattered glass windows in at least seven businesses. The Ohio River had 6-foot (1.8 m) waves that ripped a barge loose and sank it. In Dayton, a roof was partially ripped off a new car dealership which then heavily damaged several cars on the lot. Pennsylvania. The blizzard—a status verified in Pennsylvania in the US Government\\'s Weekly Weather Report—hit Pittsburgh around noon on January 26 with gale-force gusts of up to 67 mph (108 km/h), temperatures plummeting to about 15 °F (−9 °C), and a 4-inch (10 cm) deposit of snow. The winds tore off part of a factory roof, blew a tennis bubble down, and broke windows of several commercial buildings, as well as knocking down trees and breaking tree limbs, with the winds and falling trees knocking down power lines, thereby causing electricity outages in virtually every community in the Pittsburgh District. Debris was blown off an under-construction downtown office tower, hitting at least one person, therefore, warranting the closure of the below streets for about five hours. In total, ten people were treated for injuries from flying articles in Pittsburgh. The wind-driven snow and icy road conditions caused numerous accidents, prompting state and city road crews to work overnight to apply cinders and salt to reduce the slipperiness of the roads. The Western Pennsylvania AAA chapter reported upwards of 2,000 calls for service on January 27, the bulk due to cars not starting from the bitter cold and, for cars parked outside, the winds blowing snow into the engine blocks chilling the engine even further.In the City of Erie and six adjacent rural counties comprising most of northwestern Pennsylvania, schools were closed for two days. Erie only received 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) of snow on January 26, but received 8.9 inches (23 cm) more on January 28 and 29 when the second storm system moved through. On January 26 and part of January 27, Interstate 90 was closed for its entire length of northwestern Pennsylvania and Interstate 79 connecting Erie to Pittsburgh, while not closed, had complete whiteout conditions and numerous vehicles marooned along its length. There were two fatalities in Pennsylvania from the first blizzard, one a person trapped in her car in a snow drift for over 15 hours, who died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and another from a head-on car collision. The second storm most impacted western Pennsylvania the afternoon and evening of January 29, causing icy roads which resulted in crawling traffic and numerous skidding accidents, including two in the Pittsburgh area which caused single fatalities. Central Appalachians and Central Atlantic Coast. West Virginia and Virginia. In West Virginia, while there was minimal snow, winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) blew away roofs on January 26, including at an engineering building at the West Virginia University in Morgantown, and blew out numerous windows and took down trees and power lines in several different areas of the state. In parts of Virginia, winds gusted to 67 mph (108 km/h) blowing in windows, tearing down power lines, and uprooting trees or breaking off limbs, which then caused numerous temporary highway closures. One trailer with people inside was overturned and slammed down on a road but no serious injuries resulted. Maryland and Washington D.C.. The storm lashed Maryland commencing the afternoon of January 26, bringing rain and hail plus gales as high as 73 mph (117 km/h), which blew over countless trees, lifted the roof off one house, blew the walls out of an apartment unit leaving the roof to mostly collapse, blew a 350-ton construction crane into Baltimore harbour, and overturned a house trailer, although no serious injuries resulted. Power lines were also blown down or knocked down by falling trees or branches leaving almost 40,000 customers without power for a time. A tornado warning was issued the Baltimore area for two hours but no actual funnel clouds were observed.In Washington D.C., gales of 78 mph (126 km/h) blew parts of the roofs of two apartment buildings off, downed power lines down and uprooted trees, including one which demolished a car being driven on the Rock Creek Parkway—the driver only suffered minor injuries. The storm also brought hail—which was golf-balled sized in the nearby city of Laurel—rain and snow, interspersed with sunshine, and punctuated with occasional thunder and lightning, a rare winter occurrence caused by the brisk movement of the storm. North Carolina. In North Carolina, high winds blew in windows, tore down power lines, and uprooted trees or break off limbs, which then caused numerous temporary highway closures. One trailer with people inside was overturned and slammed down on a road but no serious injuries resulted. A 120 mph (190 km/h) gust tore the specially-constructed roof off of the visitor center at Grandfather Mountain State Park. New York. Western New York and central New York. Blizzard conditions enveloped most of New York State (N.Y.) west of Utica for up to 29 consecutive hours before the NWS declared the blizzard over at 9 p.m. on January 27. Unusual for a blizzard, thunder and lightning accompanied the wind and snow across the state with a lightning strike of a transmission cable taking a Syracuse television station off the air. While new snowfall amounts were minimal in some areas—Buffalo only received 2.2 inches (5.6 cm) on January 26 and 27 combined—continual 70 mph (110 km/h) winds drove snow into the windshields of cars, reducing visibility to zero, and into 8-foot (2.4 m) snow drifts which most snow plows were powerless to clear on their own. Hundreds of minor accidents occurred—so many that police could not investigate them all—including a fifteen car pile-up near Scottsville.The extremely poor road conditions, plus additional hazards such as downed power lines and tree branches and non-operational traffic signals, prompted authorities from 11 countries to ban all traffic, excepting emergency vehicles, from all roads.The New York State Police closed the 60-mile (97 km) section of the New York Thruway between Erie, Pennsylvania and Buffalo from midday January 26 to early the morning of January 27. Soon after that closure, there was an 18-vehicle collision further east on the Thruway, near Batavia. The NY State Police immediately closed the Thruway\\'s 260-mile (416 km) section from Buffalo through Rochester to Schenectady, near Albany, from 4:15 p.m. on January 26, a closure which remained in effect 47 hours until almost 4 p.m. on January 28. Thousands of travellers, including families, long-distance truck drivers and other motorists, were forced to seek refuge in hotels, Thruway rest centers, private homes, and other make-shift accommodation, such as fire halls in Batavia, most for two nights and two days. In Warsaw hundreds of marooned people were put up in private homes, the community hospital, the village firehall, the county courthouse and the village bomb shelter. The Warsaw hospital was especially full as 100 staff who were unable to travel home stayed overnight. At one point, power was cut off to 2,000 homes in the Warsaw area.Numerous towns and cities over huge area of central and western N.Y. were completely isolated for two days or more. Most airports cancelled most of their flights due to ice and snow shutting down the runways. In western New York, with all roads impassable, 200 private snowmobilers in Wyoming County organized into patrols to search all the marooned vehicles in the county\\'s 16 townships to ensure there were no stranded motorists, and to perform other emergency functions, such as delivering a furnace repair man or delivering drugs. The patrols found approximately 100 abandoned cars but none had any occupants remaining. In the Buffalo area, where the winds gusted to 80 mph (130 km/h), the State Police withdrew their patrols (aside from emergencies) for a period and numerous schools and businesses were closed. In central New York, schools in Syracuse were closed for January 27 and 28 during which 10 inches (25 cm) of snow was received (Syracuse received 13.1 inches [33 cm] for the entire five-day period). The Ithaca area to the south had 50 to 75 mph (80 to 121 km/h) winds producing blizzard conditions from 10 p.m. on January 26 to 7 a.m. on January 27 facilitating the closure of schools both days and, while roads were open, conditions were extremely hazardous with about 25 collisions occurring, including a six-car pile-up. The winds caused an electrical outage that left 115 miners in a Livingston County salt mine in the dark for 90 minutes.After a calm the afternoon of January 28, the second snowstorm dropped 6.0 more inches (15 cm)  of snow on Buffalo over three days ending January 30, while Oswego on the southern shore of Lake Ontario in Central New York, received 15.7 inches (40 cm) of snow from late January 28 until January 30, on top of 6.4 inches (16 cm) it received on January 26–27. The N.Y. State Police re-closed the entire Thruway again in the early morning hours of January 29, although it was operational again by that afternoon. Outside of Rochester and the Finger Lakes area (see next section), there were two fatalities from traffic accidents related to the blizzards in NY State, one a car-snow plow crash north of Albany on January 27 and the other a car skidding off a road near a bridge near Binghamton on January 30, while a third person died on Long Island from slipping into icy water on January 28. Long Island and New York City received a dusting of snow with bitter cold and winds from the first blizzard, which created ice that created moderate traffic and transit tie-ups. Rochester and the Finger Lakes region. In the Finger Lakes Region to the southeast of Rochester, just before noon on January 26, the sky suddenly grew dark and then driving snow came along with thunder and lightning, \"thus harkening in the \\'Blizzard of \\'71\\', which would rage almost three days.\" As the winds grew faster and visibility markedly declined, schools closed early so buses could transport the students home safely. That night, even higher velocity winds tore siding off barns and the roofs off smaller buildings, and in the morning, amidst swirling snow, Yates County closed all roads and schools until further notice, just as ten other adjacent counties were doing. In Ontario County, closer to Rochester, most law enforcement staff switched to snowmobiles instead of patrol cars, one task being to deliver gas to snow plows which had run out of fuel. One road in that county had 50 cars stuck along a section with particularly high snow drifts but many tow truck drivers, fearing for their own safety, refused to go into the blinding snow to remove stalled or abandoned cars that were blocking roads, thereby hindering plowing. In the village of Hilton, northwest of Rochester, a doctor rode a snowmobile from the volunteer fire department to deliver a baby.Rochester was especially struck hard by the blizzard, receiving 6.9 inches (18 cm) of snow over two days, snow which was blown into drifts several feet high. Greater Rochester was virtually snowbound and brought to a complete standstill with all schools, stores (including department stores), factories (including Xerox, which employed 12,000), offices, banks and government offices closed by early afternoon on January 26 and remaining closed on January 27. Thousands of school children and workers in the area were unable to travel home and were stranded in motels, emergency shelters and friends\\' homes. In addition, thousands of homes in the area lost electricity due to falling trees and limbs knocking down electricity transmission infrastructure. Bus service in and around Rochester was severely limited by the blizzard, with regional buses only getting back on schedule the early afternoon of January 27 and intercity buses resuming their routes on January 28. All flights were cancelled for much of January 26 and 27 and Rochester-Monroe County airport even officially closed for 10 hours. Two radio stations within the Region were knocked off the air. Many tow trucks refused to go into the blinding snow to remove stalled or abandoned cars that were blocking roads, in some cases hindering plowing.The morning of January 28, three-quarters of roads in Monroe County, which contains Rochester, were still impassable and most expressways or highways were open but with \"extremely limited visibility\". Then, the evening of January 28, the second storm arrived from Ontario and Michigan returning full blizzard conditions, including winds of 33 mph (53 km/h) and a further 10.0 inches (25 cm) of snow over three days, to Rochester and the surrounding area. Several highways and many suburban roads around Rochester were closed again. The Automobile Club of Rochester reported a record number of service calls between early evening January 28 and mid-day January 29, the fourth day of the blizzards, and flights at Rochester-Monroe County Airport were cancelled once more after having just returned to normal the morning of January 28. The five-days of blizzard-like conditions brought about seven fatalities in west-central New York: one Rochester-area person was found dead in their car which was buried in snow after apparently suffering a heart attack; another suffered a heart attack while skidding into another car; a third was killed in a car-school bus collision in Yates County, which also injured 12 other passengers; and, on January 29, four Rochester-area men died of heart attacks while shovelling their driveways of snow from the second blizzard. Quebec. Greater Montreal area. A leading edge of the first blizzard moved into Montreal mid-afternoon on January 26 briefly creating near-blizzard conditions, while dropping alternating periods of rain and snow, and then deposited 15.8 centimetres (6.2 in) of snow by the evening of January 27. Most dangerous was the consistent 40 to 50 km/h (25 to 31 mph) wind—with gusts of up to 100 km/h (62 mph)—which created white-out conditions (visibility 0 to 400 metres [0.00 to 0.25 mi]) for most of 16 consecutive hours from 1 a.m. to 5 p.m on January 27. With the arrival of the blizzard, the temperatures decreased rapidly from +2 °C (36 °F) at 3 p.m. to −20 °C (−4 °F), with a wind chill of −34 °C (−29 °F), overnight, although at peak wind gusts, the wind chill was −55 °C (−67 °F). Four Montrealers died from the blizzard, two pedestrians who suffered heart attacks on city streets and sidewalks, which were treacherous for walking due to ice and wind, a third who suffered a heart attack while driving, and a fourth who slipped under a commuter train which was leaving a station.As it had rained shortly before, highways and streets were frozen into sheets of ice by the bitter cold. Accidents in the hundreds, including one of 18 vehicles, plagued the city\\'s streets and expressways, as drivers were blinded by wind-driven snow and hampered by ice hidden under a thin layer of snow, with occasional knee-high snow drifts. Drivers were stuck on many city streets and expressways and abandoned their vehicles, clogging many of them—the downtown Bonaventure Expressway was closed until 1 p.m. on January 27—and Highway 3 on South Shore of the St. Lawrence River was so hazardous that motorists had to drive at 3 km/h (1.9 mph) and once they encountered one of the many pile-ups on it, abandoned their vehicles. Freeway and highway traffic leaving the city was immobilized. The morning of January 27, police requested that residents use public transportation, such as the city\\'s two subway lines, which experienced a 25% rise in ridership, but streets were still littered with abandoned cars, although traffic moved much better that afternoon rush-hour than it had the previous evening or that morning.Many flights were cancelled at Montreal\\'s airport for the 24-hours of the blizzard as the combination of icy runways, frigid temperatures and driving snow made the work of ground maintenance crews nearly impossible. Most intercity bus service was cancelled for day and a half while intercity trains were 30 minutes late for nearby destinations, but 7 1/2 hours late for those coming through Ontario. The Port of Montreal did not operate on January 27 and banks, stores, restaurants and theatres reported minimal business. Most workers were able to get home the evening of January 27 as local buses and commuter rail were beginning to function regularly again, so downtown hotels did not report many check-ins due to the blizzard. All schools in Montreal and the surrounding areas were closed for January 27 and several areas in the city proper had power blackouts. The fierce stormstorm that hit southwestern Ontario and west-central New York on January 29, affected Montreal for half a day beginning after midnight on January 30, producing moderate winds, 10.7 centimetres (4.2 in) of snow, and visibility as low as 600 metres (0.37 mi)distance for certain times; several roads and highways on Montreal\\'s South Shore were closed for a few hours due to drifts and scores of multiple-vehicle traffic collisions; flights were also cancelled that morning. Southeastern Quebec and Quebec City. The Eastern Townships southeast of Montreal had so many accidents being reported that it took at least three hours for police to arrive at most of them. The Trans-Canada Highway had a pile-up involving four transport trucks east of Montreal and, near Drummonville, 60 motorists were stranded in their cars due to blinding conditions and blocked exits—snow clearing equipment had been unable to get through the exits, with some equipment breaking down in the high drifts. The area received 15 centimetres (5.9 in) of snow and experienced near-blizzard conditions (visibility 800 m to 1 km) for most of December 27.Quebec City was especially hard hit by the blizzard, receiving 27.2 centimetres (10.7 in) of snow, 15.5 centimetres (6.1 in) of that on January 27, with consistent winds of 48 km/h (30 mph), gusting to 72 km/h (45 mph), which created close to white-out conditions (visibility between 400 and 800 metres [0.25 and 0.50 mi]) for 10 hours ending mid-afternoon on January 27. The conditions brought traffic in and near Quebec City to a standstill and all schools in the region were closed on January 27. Ferry service across the St. Lawrence River was suspended, Quebec City\\'s airport was closed, and all highways across the province were closed by the blizzard, even the three tolled freeways. In addition to the four fatalities in Montreal, two other deaths occurred in Quebec—one person hit by a car 65 km (40 miles) northeast of Quebec City, and another person on a motorcycle was struck by a car in northern Quebec. On January 30, the second storm hit Quebec City with 25.9 centimetres (10.2 in) more snow and near-blizzard conditions (visibility ranging from 400 to 1,200 metres [0.25 to 0.75 mi]) for 11 hours. New England. The blizzard rampaged into New England on January 27 creating whiteout conditions in large parts of New Hampshire and Vermont, with near blizzard conditions in northern Connecticut and most of Maine. The NWS declared it the first \\'true\\' blizzard to hit Vermont in many years and stated the wind chill factor was between -40 and -50F (-40 to -46C). Vermont received between 5 and 24 inches (13 and 61 cm) of snow, with the highest amounts in the north—most schools in central and northern Vermont were closed by midday on January 27 and remained closed on January 28. Burlington received 6.2 inches (16 cm) and stopped plowing its city streets as plows could not keep up with the blowing and drifting snow. The state also stopped plowing its highways, and the speed limit on Interstate Highways in Vermont was reduced to 40 mph (64 km/h) because of the poor driving conditions, but intercity buses were only delayed by about 30 minutes. In Massachusetts, the morning of January 27 had cold winds, blowing snow, near-zero visibility and highways glazed with inch-thick ice which resulted in hundreds of collisions and stranded cars \"in piles\" on expressways in Boston.Winds from the storm died down somewhat by the time it reached Maine, sparing the state actual blizzard conditions, but the combination of winds, the high tide subsiding, and coastal sea-ice breaking up, destroyed 85% of the pier of the Portland Yacht Club and a quarter or more of several other piers in the area. Bangor, Maine received only 0.8 inch of snow but like the rest of New England, the temperature plummeted, in that city to −23.7 °F (−30.9 °C). Maritime Canada. The storm\\'s strength dissipated more by the time it reach southern New Brunswick and later Nova Scotia, in Canada. Saint John, the most impacted city in New Brunswick, had brief snow squalls with 6.6 centimetres (2.6 in) of snow on the evening of January 27 along with brief winds gusts as high as 101 km/h (63 mph) and the temperature dropped to −16.7 °C (1.9 °F) by the morning of January 28. Halifax, Nova Scotia had 8.1 centimetres (3.2 in) of snow the night of January 27 with the temperature plummeting to −16.7 °C (1.9 °F) at dawn the next morning.

      "{'input': ' Background. The 7th Parliament of Kazakhstan was formed in the aftermath of the 2021 legislative elections, in which the composition of the lower chamber Mäjilis was left unchanged as only three pro-government parties, Nur Otan (now Amanat), Aq Jol Democratic Party, and the People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan, retained their factions in the parliament. The ruling Nur Otan party, though unusually losing more seats, continued to keep their 76-seat supermajority control of the Mäjilis. The legislative elections were the first to take place following the resignation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2019. At that time, Nazarbayev continued serving as the chairman of Nur Otan and had held a variety of notable political positions and powers in his post-presidency, most importantly the influential Security Council chairmanship. Following the 2021 elections, Mäjilis chairman Nurlan Nigmatulin (Nur Otan) and Prime Minister Asqar Mamin were reappointed to their respective posts, along with Dariga Nazarbayeva returning as an MP were moves described as a continued political influence held by Nazarbayev over the new parliament due to his control over the ruling party and an open endorsement of those key government names.Throughout the course of the 7th Parliament, a series of major constitutional and political reforms in par with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev\\'s policies took place in Kazakhstan with hundreds of proposed bills being passed by the Mäjilis. 2022 unrest and constitutional referendum. In January 2022, massive protests and unrest occurred in Kazakhstan after a sudden increase in liquefied petroleoum gas (LPG) prices in the city of Zhanaozen. The protests originally started as small rallies from Zhanaozen with demands in reduction of the LPG prices, but quickly spread grew to nationwide protests in calls for political and socioeconomic reforms. President Tokayev, in a failed attempt to appease the growing protests, pledged to take measures by setting a price cap on LPG and other forms of fuel and basic food products, as well as instituting a moratorium on utility costs and rent subsidies for low-income people. This led him to dismiss Asqar Mamin\\'s government and enact a state of emergency, along with a deadly force order which was provided by the backing of foreign peacekeeping forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, after chaotic unrest broke out in the largest city of Almaty and the rest of Kazakhstan\\'s territory.As the aftermath of the January 2022 unrest was left with inflicted civilian casualties and costly property damages across the country, President Tokayev – following his takeover of the Security Council chairmanship from Nazarbayev – announced a new wave of political and constitutional reforms in a March 2022 State of the Nation Address. These reforms would lessen his executive powers and allocate more authority to the parliament. To do so, he initiated a referendum that would allow for Kazakh citizens to directly vote for the proposed 56 amendments. In a 2022 constitutional referendum, an overwhelming majority of Kazakhs had officially voted in favour for changes to the Constitution of Kazakhstan, which changed nearly a total of one-third or 33 articles in the document. The newly proposed amendments included changes within the structure of governance, electoral system, decentralisation of power between the levels of governments, and paved the way for complete stripping of Nazarbayev\\'s remaining constitutional powers of being a Elbasy (leader of the nation). 2022 presidential election. Amid speculations of power consolidation, President Tokayev announced 2022 snap presidential elections for November in his September 2022 State of the Nation Address, citing his personal need for a \"new mandate of trust from the people\" and said that the early election would \"significantly lower the risks of power monopolisation\". The move was described by Reuters as an attempt by Tokayev to strengthen his \"mandate as an independent leader\" and potentially avoid economic deterioration and loss of public support if holding elections ahead of originally scheduled date for 2024. Sceptics suggested the possibility of Tokayev using the 2022 presidential elections as a way to extend his rule similarly to his predecessor Nazarbayev, citing Tokayev\\'s current control over all major branches of Kazakh government and his proposal for a new constitutional amendment that would change the presidential term of office to a nonrenewable seven-year term. In an effort to boost his support after the announcement of elections, Tokayev declared amnesty for the participants in the January 2022 unrest and supported reverting the controversial capital name of Nur-Sultan back to Astana.Due to early timing of the 2022 presidential election, the political sphere was left without the organisation of the opposition, as no new political party had been registered due to the Kazakh legislation restricting citizens in contesting the race. With exception of Tokayev seeking reelection, other presidential contestants were described as \"pocket candidates\" due to their little public popularity who did not pose any significant electoral challenge to Tokayev. The results left Tokayev securing an 81.3% landslide victory in the election, with Tokayev in his inaugural speech promising to fulfill his election programme within the remaining seven years of his presidential term. 2023 Senate elections. After assuming office, Tokayev announced January 2023 Senate elections, stressing the need in \"continuation of the practical implementation of the constitutional reform\", adding that the results will allow for Senate deputy corps to be renewed in \"principles of competition and openness\". This decision came after constitutional changes in the structure and powers of the Senate and the coming term expiration for senators that were previously elected in 2017, to which the senate election would be conducted as part of Tokayev\\'s political reforms.In total, 20 senators were elected by local assemblies (mäslihats) with 130 people initially nominating their candidacies, including several barred activists who claimed of constitutional rights violations that prevented them from becoming candidates. Snap election speculations. Speculations of snap elections for parliament began during the January 2022 unrest, with unconfirmed media reports of Tokayev potentially discussing the issue of dissolving the 7th Parliament. A variety of predictions were made, many of which predicted snap legislative elections sometime in late 2022 or early 2023.After Tokayev initially announced his package of political reforms in the upcoming September 2022 State of the Nation Address, several political commentators expressed support for holding snap legislative elections, with political analyst Zamir Qarajanov citing a need in change of laws regarding elections and MPs and that the if a snap election is called by Tokayev, then it would likely be held sometime around January and February 2023. According to Gaziz Äbişev, the drafting of new political reforms would concern parties and elections and that it would lead to the issue of the early dissolution of the parliament being raised. Proponents of an early vote for Mäjilis concluded that Tokayev must first present his package of political reforms that would allow for newer parties to form and conduct the legislative timeframe for their implementation before scheduling a snap election date. Political scientist Älibek Tajibaev argued against snap election, saying that the parliamentary formation is strongly tied with the general election style, noting that voting dates are \"predetermined chronologically\" and that non-parliamentary and newly formed parties should prepare for the regularly scheduled 2025 legislative election by instead focusing their campaigning first in municipal races.Despite widescale discussions of a potential snap election, Mäjilis chairman Erlan Qoşanov in April 2022 dismissed any rumours of an early dissolution of the 7th Parliament, claiming that issues of holding an early vote had not been discussed at all.However, on 1 September 2022 at the State of the Nation Address, Tokayev officially announced snap legislative elections in the first half of 2023. He cited the need for the legislative bodies to be \"naturally renewed\" and said that a new parliamentary composition will represent the interests of \"broad groups of citizens\" to allow executive branch to enact more \"balanced decisions\", adding that the snap legislative election would conclude \"a reset and renewal of all major political institutions\". At the 23 November 2022 plenary session of the Mäjilis, chairman Qoşanov in regard to the timing for an upcoming snap election, stated that the announcement of it would be made by Tokayev and forecast the date to be held sometime in 2023. Shortly after Tokayev\\'s reelection win in the 2022 presidential election, he signed a decree on 26 November in approving an action plan made under the basis of his electoral programme, which initially included a deadline in holding of a Mäjilis election no later than June 2023. Dissolution of the 7th Parliament. In early January 2023, the insider source of KazTAG reported on the 7th Parliament\\'s dissolution taking place within a coming week, to which the possibility of it was confirmed on 11 January by the head of the Mäjilis Committee on Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform Arman Qojahmetov, who suggested for the dissolution to be declared by Tokayev sometime in the month of January, though not ruling out the power of Mäjilis members to request the parliament to be dissolved themselves.On 19 January 2023, Tokayev signed a presidential decree in officially abolishing the 7th Parliament and scheduling the snap elections for Mäjilis to take place on 19 March 2023, a date noted to specifically coincide with Nowruz and former president Nursultan Nazarbayev\\'s resignation four years earlier. Upon singing the decree, Tokayev praised the Mäjilis members for their legislative work, saying that they had set the example of \"high professionalism, responsibility to citizens and sincere patriotism\". In a following address to Kazakh citizens, Tokayev expressed hope for the \"updated compositions of deputies\" and that the Central Election Commission and the Prosecutor General\\'s Office along with poll observers will strictly monitor the \"rule of law, transparency and fairness\" of the election, whilst taking into account of campaign demonstrating \"a high level of political culture\" and contributing the \"consolidation of our society\". He also added that the snap elections will be final stage of \"rebooting state institutions\" that would coincide with the formula of a \"strong President – influential Parliament – accountable Government\". Electoral system. Under Article 85 of the Constitutional Law \"On Elections\", the legislative elections in Kazakhstan for the Mäjilis members, who are known as deputies, are held within five years after the expiration of a legal term length for Mäjilis members. In accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution, a person must be at least 25 years or older and had been a permanent resident for the last ten years in Kazakhstan to serve as a member of the Mäjilis. 2022 amendments. Following constitutional changes as a result of the 2022 referendum, the number of seats in the Mäjilis were reduced from 107 to 98 (due to the abolition of the previous nine-seat quota that was reserved to the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan), leaving all the remaining seats to be elected through mixed-member majoritarian representation for the first time since 2004.Under the new electoral system, the Mäjilis (consisting of total 98 members) is divided into the following methods of election: 70% (69 members) from closed list party-list proportional representation allocated using the largest remainder method and 30% (29 members) from single-member districts that use the first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) method. Electoral and party-list quota. Under the Kazakh law, a series of legal quotas are mandated regarding to the political party\\'s overall performance in the election and its electoral list of candidates.. Article 97-1 of the Constitutional Law \"On Elections\" establishes a minimum of 5% electoral threshold (previously reduced from 7% in 2021) for a party to earn proportional representational seats in the Mäjilis. If only one party obtains at least 5% of the proportional vote share, then the party that received the next largest number of votes and hadn\\'t overcome the electoral barrier is allowed to receive at least two mandates.Since the 2021 election, a mandatory fixed share of political representatives had been in place, which Article 89 of the Constitutional Law \"On Elections\" requires for parties to include at least 30% quota of women, young people (aged under 29), and disabled persons within their electoral lists. Electoral districts. On 22 November 2022, the Central Election Commission (CEC) adopted a resolution in reestablishing electoral districts in Kazakhstan, upon which were previously dissolved in 2007 amendment, beginning on 1 January 2023 that would guarantee each region including cities of republican significance (Almaty, Astana, and Shymkent) a one representative seat, with all constituencies including no more than the 20% difference between the number of registered voters residing in them.The list of boundaries of the newly formed 29 single-member districts were drawn up and published on 24 December 2022, with the city of Almaty and Turkistan Region having the most elected representatives due to their population sizes. Timetable. Article 85 of the Constitutional Law \"On Elections\" stipulates that the legislative elections must be scheduled by the President five months in advance and conducted within two months before the termination of a current established term length for Mäjilis members (since 14 January 2021), in which the legislative elections should have been originally held no later than 14 November 2025.In a Central Election Commission (CEC) meeting on 20 January 2023, deputy chairman Konstantin Petrov unveiled the calendar plan for the 2023 legislative election, upon which the total duration amounted to 59 days: Parties. Prior to the 2021 legislative election, the mandatory threshold for party registration was initially reduced to 20,000 members in a way to allow for new parties to be formed. Despite the laxed rules, no new parties were registered during that time period as the Ministry of Justice repeatedly rejected the wishing parties\\' application requests. Eventually, President Tokayev proposed a constitutional law in lowering the registration threshold even more to 5,000 and reiterated that new parties will appear in political sphere, though asserted that some parties could not be \"artificially\" registered due to their violations of the law. He also later did not rule out the possibility of some newly upcoming Mäjilis members to hold opposition views.Prior before the constitutional amendments regarding the eased party registration rules came to force, there were a total of 16 initiative groups formed in attempt to seek their legalised party status. Both the opposition parties of Alga, Qazaqstan and Namys failed to obtain their legal statuses. These instances were described due to inability of the Kazakh government registering independent parties that pose \"real competition\" and that only pro-government organisation would be registered. Contesting. On 21 January 2023, the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced the admission of all seven registered political parties to participate in the 2023 legislative elections to field their candidates according to their party lists.However, Vice Justice Minister Alma Mūqanova revealed that the ministry was considering two parties of El tağdyry and Ūrpaqtar jalğastyğy of their applicational documents and that if they succeed in passing state registration by 8 February 2023, then the additional parties would be permitted to also take part in the election. In spite of that, no further party registrations took place during that timeframe, thus leaving exactly seven previously registered parties to contest the race in the end.The CEC on 18 February 2022 conducted a draw procedure which established the number listing that each contesting party appeared on the ballot by order: Candidates by party affiliation. There were 283 candidates chosen from all seven participating parties within electoral lists, as well as 609 candidates nominated in all single-member districts in which overwhelmingly 525 were self-nominees (independents) whilst 79 candidates from seven political parties and 5 candidates from four public associations. The average number of nominated contestants in each constituency was 21 with the most being in Electoral district No. 1 and No. 2 of Astana (63 candidates each) and the least in No. 28 of Ulytau Region (6 candidates).Following the registration period, 281 party list nominees officially became candidates (as two from Respublica dropped out of the race), with a mandatory quota of women, youth and persons with disabilities in each party list averaging to 38.1% of candidates as well as 12 ethnical representatives. In single-member districts, a total of 435 candidates were registered with 359 (82.5%) independents and 76 (17.5%) from parties, leaving 125 people having their candidatures rejected by the CEC due to voluntarily withdraws, improper document submissions, and campaign law violations. The average of constituent candidate was approximately 49–50 years old, with an overall gender composition making up of 350 (80.5%) male and 85 (20%) female including 10 ethnical representatives. There were an average of 15 registered candidates in Kazakhstan\\'s constituencies as the greatest number of contestants being within the electoral districts No. 1 and No. 2 of Astana (41 and 42 candidates each), with the lowest in No. 25 of Turkistan Region (5 candidates). Campaign. According to Vice Minister of Information and Social Development Qanat Ysqaqov, the ministry would monitor information field during the electoral campaign and report any violations to the Prosecutor General\\'s Office. Jandos Ömiräliev, the Deputy Prosecutor General, cited that the unlawful acts in the election would be conducting election campaigning during the period of its prohibition, obstruction of candidates as well as their proxies or political parties during their canvassing. People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan. The People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) in a political council meeting on 21 January 2023 announced that the party would actively participate in the elections and established the republican campaign headquarters.On 30 January 2023, the 23rd QHP Extraordinary Congress was held. From there, party chairman Ermūhamet Ertısbaev called on Kazakh citizens to show up at polling stations rather than public squares to fulfill all demands \"in a civilized and democratic way\", embarking the effectiveness of changing the system via means of parliamentary resolutions. A number of issues were discussed at the congress, upon which were related to energy and industry, maternal support, as well as land transfer and migratory employment. Prior before the congress was held, the QHP experienced discontent within the party\\'s membership as its three Mäjilis serving members most notably Jambyl Ahmetbekov had left the QHP with Ahmetbekov citing the unfitting new leadership of the party. The QHP in its party list included a total 52 people as well as 12 candidates in majoritarian districts for the election, to which Ertısbaev described the names as being the \"best and most worthy members of the political organisation\" and noted the multinational and social composition of the QHP candidates. According to Ertısbaev, the QHP had initially included more than 120 people in its party list, which was eventually narrowed down to in way to correlate with the actual distribution of seats in the Mäjilis, with Ertısbaev expressing confidence that the party would sweep around 40–45 seats. Aq Jol Democratic Party. In a statement published by the Aq Jol Democratic Party on 20 January 2023, the party expressed its interest in taking part for Mäjilis election to which it should serve as the beginning of a \"profound and fundamental change\" in the fate of Kazakhstan.The Aq Jol in its 21st Ordinary Congress on 1 February 2023, upon which was attended by the party members, adopted a decision in participating in the legislative election along the party\\'s election programme. A total of 77 Aq Jol candidates were nominated with 54 of them being in the party list that included such people as chairman Azat Peruashev, Dania Espaeva, Qazybek Isa and Älia Raqyşeva. One of the names in the list was \"Qairat Boranbaev\", despite everyone suspecting that it may have been the controversial businessman Qairat Boranbaev who faced criminal investigations for alleged money embezzlement, it turned out to be a different person with the same name While the rest of 23 candidates were nominated for single-member districts by the Aq Jol. At the congress, Peruashev raised the issue regarding corruption and the \"gap between rich and poor\" due to a monopoly impact in economic and political spheres which brings the issues on the party\\'s relevancy. He also expressed his willingness for the Aq Jol in the election to \"gain the trust of the people\", noting that \"any ruling party\" will lose power \"sooner or later\".Months prior to the election, Aq Jol MP Azamat Äbıldaev, was ousted from the party and removed from Mäjilis over his public support for Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. Some speculated that this controversy was an act made to advertise the party in a good light. It is notable, however, that Äbıldaev later appeared as a guest in Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov\\'s controversial show Solovyov LIVE, where he expressed his negative opinion about the \"rising nationalism in Kazakhstan\". Nationwide Social Democratic Party. After previously boycotting the 2021 legislative elections, the opposition Nationwide Social Democratic Party (JSDP) expressed its willingness to take part in the snap election, citing the recent changes in \"legislative conditions and the system of power itself\".The JSDP held its 20th Extraordinary Congress on 2 February 2023, to where it was attended by 46 party delegates and adopted a decision in developing the election programme. It also fielded its 25 Mäjilis candidates with 19 people being included in the JSDP party list whilst the rest of six candidates vying for seats in electoral districts, to which party chairman Ashat Raqymjanov asserted their popularity within their constituents. Baytaq. The newly registered \"Baytaq\" Green Party of Kazakhstan on 20 January 2023 announced that it would participate for the first time in the election, citing an opportunity in changing the Kazakhstan\\'s environmental responsibility policy. On 21 January, party chairman Azamathan Ämirtai revealed that Baytaq would aim at raising environmental issues within the parliamentary hearings.The pre-election congress of Baytaq was held on 3 February 2023, from which Ämirtai while criticising other parties, insisted that the Baytaq party was fighting for \"people\\'s lives\" by stressing the need of environmental protection in Kazakhstan and its correlation with the health and quality of life for citizens, to which Ämirtai described it as an \"urgent issue\". He addressed the needs in paying special attention to ecologic problematic areas of the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk Test Site, as well as waste problems from subsoil users in western Kazakhstan. In a decision by the pre-election congress, 20 members were included in the party list of Baytaq, with an extra four candidates that included Ämirtai himself being nominated in territorial constituencies. Auyl. Äli Bektaev, chairman of the \"Auyl\" People\\'s Democratic Patriotic Party, in his official statement supported the decision in holding snap elections and embarked that party is ready to fight \"honestly and openly in the new election cycle\".On 4 February 2023, the 22nd Auyl Extraordinary Congress was held from where it approved a list of 25 party list candidates and nine candidates for majoritarian districts. Auyl chairman Äli Bektaev speaking at the congress, voiced his high hopes for the party\\'s performance in the election due its improved structural work and stressed the importance of the development of agriculture, agrarian sphere, and rural settlements to which Bektaev emphasised that enhancing the situation and citizens lives in villages would in turn lead to a subsequent improvement in urban cities. The published party list of Auyl received an unusual media attention after its names included both 2022 presidential candidates of the Auyl\\'s first deputy chairman Jiguli Dairabaev and former ruling Amanat party member Qaraqat Äbden in the same listing, with Bektaev confirming Äbden\\'s membership into the Auyl by stating that her social views on folk and rural traditions correlated with the party\\'s ideology. Respublica. On 21 January 2023, Respublica chairman Aidarbek Qojanazarov in the aftermath of the party\\'s registration announced that Respublica would for the first time participate in the legislative elections, noting that the party would conduct the \"most transparent and fair selection\" of candidates. On 3 February 2023, it was announced that Respulica would hold its 1st Extraordinary Congress, where the party\\'s updated charter would be presented and approved.The congress held in an informal tie-less format took place on 6 February, where Hodjanazarov stated that Respublica prioritises human capital as being \"the greatest wealth\" of Kazakhstan, specifically being in the fields of education and health. The party nominated a total of 29 candidates for the election from its list that included business representatives, with four competing for mandates in single-member districts. Amanat. Prior before announcement of legislative elections, Amanat chairman Erlan Qoşanov in April 2022 had voiced his anticipation on the party\\'s preparedness in the upcoming vote. After the dissolution of the 7th Parliament, Qoşanov in a 20 January 2023 party meeting stated that the Amanat supported Tokayev\\'s decision in calling snap elections and asserted that the party is the \"main driving force of progressive transformations\", citing the previous work in helping the affected residents of Kostanay and Ekibastuz, as well regions that faced storm floods to which Qoşanov reiterated the Amanat\\'s position of taking part in the election. On 31 January, Qoşanov revealed the party would hold its upcoming extraordinary congress.On 7 February 2023, the 25th Amanat Extraordinary Congress took place to which more than 2,000 people attended that included political council members, former 7th Mäjilis deputies, party delegates, members from the party\\'s Jastar Ruhy youth wing, as well as experts, representatives from NGO and the media. The Amanat nominated a total of 119 candidates (90 from party list and 29 in single-member districts) that encompassed former MPs, government officials, as well as notable bloggers, sports and chess players to which party chairman Qoşanov described the candidates as being \"authoritative, educated and qualified people\" and assuring that the composition of Amanat had led for it to become a \"party of leaders\". Independents. In December 2022, a group of opposition activists and journalists, namely Arailym Nazarova, Älnur Iliaşev, Dinara Egeubaeva, and Duman Muhammedkärim, announced their candidacy for the 2023 legislative elections in Kazakhstan. They formed an independent electoral alliance called Altynşy Qañtar (Sixth January, in relation to the 2022 unrest), which aimed to support various opposition candidates running in both national and local races. Iliaşev stated that the bloc\\'s ultimate goal was to bring about significant democratic reforms by gaining representation in the parliament. Out of the four mentioned names, only Egeubaeva and Nazarova were able to be successfully register as candidates, as Iliaşev and Muhammedkärim were both initially barred from running in the election due to their criminal records and failures to reside as permanent resident, respectively. However, Muhammedkärim successfully appealed his rejected candidature in the Electoral district No. 12 of Almaty Region, resulting in his candidacy being registered in the constituency.By early February 2023, several independent candidates had expressed interest in running for the constituent races for Mäjilis, which included businessman Sanjar Boqaev, leader of the unregistered Namys party; civil activist Inga Imanbai, spouse of jailed unregistered Democratic Party leader Janbolat Mamai; civil activist Maks Boqaev, participant in the 2016 anti-land reform protests; journalist Äset Mataev, founder of KazTAG news agency; journalist Ermurat Bapi, former chairman of the opposition Nationwide Social Democratic Party; and aqyn Rinat Zaiytov, participant in the 2019 presidential election protests. All of these candidates were registered to run, leaving only Maks Boqaev in failing to undergo the candidate registration process due to his current criminal conviction over involvement in the 2016 protests. Zayitov, known to be an opposition critic of President Tokayev and the government, was suddenly included in the electoral list of the ruling Amanat party. This sparked a huge outrage amongst Zayitov\\'s supporters to which in response, Zayitov dispelled the criticism by stressing his goal at the Amanat party was to \"change it from the inside out\" and in turn asked for his support in the election.On 19 February 2023, civil activists Älnur Iliaşev and Murat Turymbetov, along with opposition independent candidates held a sanctioned campaign rally in Gandi Park, Almaty, to which 100 people attended. From there, Arailym Nazarova, head of NGO Independent Observers, criticised the percentage of majoritarian representation in the parliament and called for independent observation in the election as way to ensure the transparency of the vote. Äset Mataev in the rally supported an \"independent parliament\" composed of \"free people\" rather than \"push-button deputies\" that would make Kazakhstan \"rich and happy\", noting that the last \"free elections\" were held in 2004 by using Serikbolsyn Abdildin as an example of a candidate that managed to be elected through such system. Sociologist Janar Jandosova in participation of the rally, drew attention to a low voter turnout rate in Almaty and thus urged people to show up at the polls. Politician Muhtar Taijan, speaking at the event, asserted that if at least 10 opposition candidates manage to be elected in the parliament, then they would be able \"to achieve reforms that the people need\". While criticising President Tokayev\\'s administration, Taijan also called on fair elections and stressed the need in \"real and popular candidates\" to come into power, in which he announced the formation of an electoral alliance in a following day that would be composed of independent candidates.A press conference took place in Almaty on 20 February by independent opposition candidates on the official announcement of the creation of an electoral alliance, which included Aiman Tursunhan, Ermurat Bapi, Muhtar Taijan, Sanjar Boqaev, Erlan Qaliev as well as Altynşy Qañtar bloc founder Arailym Nazarova, to which she stated that her work was carried out autonomously and that she was not involved in the bloc\\'s activities. The candidates stressed the need for unification of independent candidates in order to \"increase the competence of parliament as a common goal\", not ruling out the demands in returning a parliamentary system in Kazakhstan and poised themselves as supporters of majoritarian representation. At the conference, an election manifesto was adopted by the founding bloc, which pledged to maintain the balance of three branches of government, ensuring greater local government, freedom of press, and the nation\\'s wealth belonging to the people while under pretext of a \"strong parliament, accountable government\" (a somewhat resemblance of President Tokayev\\'s ideological view). Controversies. Campaign law violations. Prior to the campaigning period, the ruling Amanat party received widespread attention from social media after the party\\'s election advertisement was spotted being illegally installed on several public billboard displays in Karaganda, a day in advance by the required law. In response to the backlash, the Amanat party\\'s regional branch acknowledging the violation of the election law in an official statement, revealed that its campaign banner was hung by its advertising contractors and that the banner was subsequently removed within 30 minutes after the party\\'s regional branch responded to the complaints. The party also announced that it would it take legal action and unilaterally terminate its contract with the service providers behind the incident. Opposition activist and independent MP candidate, Sanjar Boqaev, criticised the ruling Amanat party following the incident, in which he called for the party to be barred from participating in the elections, citing the legal provision within the election law in regard to its violation.Several opposition candidates also had come under scrutiny by the Kazakh prosecutors, due to allegedly violating election laws as well such as independents Marat Jylanbaev, Amangeldi Jahin, and Jasulan Aitmağanbetov, by which they were accused of illegally conducting their agitation on social media during the pre-campaign timeframe of the election and in result, faced fines and revoking of their candidacy registration. Despite the punishments, the independent candidates dismissed the court\\'s rulings, insisted that communication on social media was not legally defined as an \"agitation\". Temirtas Synmetullaev, deputy candidate from Karaganda, received a fine on 2 March 2023 due to his pre-campaign Facebook posts in which he denied accusations, claiming the use of alleged photoshopping over his posted words.The Prosecutor General\\'s Office of Kazakhstan issued a conclusive report on 17 March, stating 23 election law violations, mainly related to prohibited campaigning (such as unnamed candidates providing free taxi rides or sand-gravel mixture services), unauthorized independent polling, and distribution of anonymous or vandalizing campaign materials. Exclusion of independent candidates. A number of candidates who were mostly independents were barred and even excluded from the national and local elections despite previously overgoing the registration requirements, mainly due to their tax noncompliances to even allegations of copyright infringements as well by the courts. Deputy PM and Finance Minister Erulan Jamaubaev denied any political motivations for the refusals in registration of independent candidates for the election, adding that the State Revenue Committee would verify mistakes in the candidates\\' financial declarations.Civil activist Äigerım Tıleujan originally had her candidacy rejected by the Almaty\\'s District Election Commission No. 3 on 17 February 2023, due to her electoral registration fee being deemed not authentic as Tıleujan was under investigation by the Kazakh authorities for allegedly inciting an attack on the Almaty International Airport during the January 2022 unrest. In an appeal effort, Tıleujan successfully won a lawsuit against the district election commission\\'s decision in a ruling made by the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan on 27 February, thus essentially becoming a registered candidate in the election. However on 11 March 2023, Tıleujan was once again removed from the race by the district election commission, due to \"discrepancies\" in her tax returns. Qaiyrğali Köneev, a physician and public figure, was denied registration as an independent MP candidate on the absurd basis of leaving Kazakhstan and never returning despite having to physically lived and worked in Almaty the whole time, in which Köneev ironically demanded to be awarded and nominated for the Nobel Prize as being the world\\'s first teleported person.In response to increasing pressure by the Kazakh government over its removal of independent candidates, opposition activists in a press conference on 9 March 2023 voiced their concerns over the issue, complaining about being \"illegally alienated\" from the elections and that the decision was unfounded, an allegation that was dismissed by the CEC member Şavkat Ötemisov as he suggested for candidates to instead \"appeal to the court and try again to participate in the elections.\" On 17 March, the CEC reported that a total of 166 complaints were filed to the courts by the removed candidates and that only six of the candidates had their registration successfully reinstated. According to Asylbek Aijaryquly, member of the CEC, an \"objective decision\" regarding the removal of independent candidates will be determined by a court case.The frequent changes to the list of candidates posed challenges in preparing the voting ballots, as some candidates who had withdrawn from their constituent races were mistakenly included in the thousands of already printed ballots near election day. In Almaty, the chairwoman of the territorial election commission, Aigül Qalyqova, explained that election commission members were required by law to manually cross out the names of withdrawn candidates with a blue pen and leave their personal signatures next to the crossed-out columns. Political pressure towards candidates. Journalist and independent candidate Inga Imanbai for Electoral district No. 3 (Almaty) during her campaign announced in holding of a solitary picket in support of Ukraine for the first anniversary of Russian\\'s invasion on 24 February 2023, in which her request was rejected by the Almaty äkim Erbolat Dosaev for allegedly submitting her permission a day late. Imanbai dismissed the moves by the akimat as \"bureaucratic delays\" being \"used as excuses\" and accused the Kazakh government of refusing its citizens in showing support for the Ukrainian people. Nevertheless, Imanbai initially pledged to hold an anti-war speech instead in her election headquarters office. On 27 February, Imanbai reported that she was summoned by the police due to inciting a \"national animus\" after holding a single picket protest in the office of Human Rights Bureau in Kazakhstan. After her release from the police station, Imanbai accused the Kazakh authorities of attempting to remove her candidacy from the race due for holding pro-Ukraine views.On 14 March 2023, a car parade in support of Mäjilis candidate Sabyrjan Qalmuhambetov for Electoral district No. 10 was held in Aktobe, in which the car drivers were forced to stop the campaign rally by the law enforcement due to Qalmuhambetov not obtaining an event permission from the city authorities. As a result, Qalmuhambetov\\'s campaign faced investigation by the prosecutor\\'s office due to his holding of an unsanctioned campaign rally. Attacks against journalists. With the announcement of the 2023 elections, growing attacks on journalists across Kazakhstan had occurred beginning with journalist Dinara Egeubaeva, a Mäjilis candidate and one of founders of the Altynşy Qañtar electoral alliance, faced an immediate intimidation shortly after announcing her interest in participating in the election in which a brick was thrown to her vehicle and then set on fire in the night of 14 January 2023 near her Almaty apartment. The following day on 15 January, the Kazakh law enforcement detained five underaged suspects who were 15, 16, and 17 years of age in which they allegedly received orders from an unknown individual in exchange for bribes according to their own testimonies and were also accused of breaking glass door entrance at the El Media office. Samal Ibraeva, chief editor of the Ulysmedia.kz, announced on 18 January 2023 that a cyberattack occurred on the site which leaked personal information of herself and family members, accusing the National Security Committee (ŪQK) of being behind the cyberattack. On 8 February 2023, the Ulysmedia.kz editorial office in Astana having received a box of \"raw meat and pictures of children\", to which she described the incident as \"intimidation\". Journalist Vadim Boreiko of the \"Гиперборей\" YouTube channel, reported of a burned construction foam outside his apartment door in Almaty, as well as two cars belonging to him and videographer Roman Yegorov being burned down on 20 February. The incident led to a swift response by the Almaty Department of Internal Affairs by launching investigation in which the unnamed suspect behind the arson was subsequently arrested. Daniar Moldabekov, a Kazakh journalist and author of the \"5 Қаңтар\" (\"5 January\") Telegram channel, revealed on 22 February that a man with a medical mask was shot in the entrance of his Almaty residence. Gulnoza Said, coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, urged the Kazakh government to ensure that the journalists\\' safety and for the criminals to be held accountable.The increasing threats on journalists essentially prompted for President Tokayev to intervene by instructing law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigation of criminal acts towards journalists, in which Aqorda press secretary Ruslan Jeldibai accused the criminal instigators of damaging \"public security and the reputation of the state\".  By 21 February 2023, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that 18 people had been arrested in relation to the attacks on journalists. Though, Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Marat Qojaev assessed that it was it was \"too early to say that the attacks were carried out on the orders of someone.\" On 28 February, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and ŪQK announced the arrest of a suspect identified as \"O. Tokarev\", allegedly responsible for organised attacks against journalists and independent media, revealing that Tokarev was a foreign citizen and a skilled hacker, and he was accompanied by four other foreign nationals named \"K. Litvinov,\" \"S. Shapovalov,\" \"B. Demchenko,\" and \"Y. Malyshok.\" In an official report from 2 March 2023, it stated that Tokarev had pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Kazakh authorities in the criminal probe. People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan v. Arman Şoraev. On 24 February 2023, Arman Şoraev, an independent candidate for Mäjilis in the Electoral district No. 2 (Astana), sparked a scandal on social media by publishing a Facebook photo of members from the People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) and writing \"Do not vote for these traitors\" underneath the caption, to which the post was criticised for its divisive language and perceived discreditation on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General\\'s Office against Şoraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology. Şoraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.On 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against Şoraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party, which if proven in court, would lead for Şoraev having his Mäjilis candidacy be deregistered from the election. The hearings initially set to be held from 6 March, were postponed that same day for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up. On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found Şoraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by the court would come into force until election day on 19 March, which nevertheless allowed for Şoraev to remain as a candidate in the race and insisting as the incident being a provocation by the Kazakh government to delegitimise his candidacy. Proposals to the Article 272 of the Criminal Code. The Senate of Kazakhstan approved a draft law \"On introduction of amendments and additions to some legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the prevention of human rights in the field of criminal proceedings, execution, as well as other cruel, inhuman or defamatory acts of torture\". The law proposes stricter penalties under Article 272 of the Criminal Code for individuals who call for the incitement of mass riots by increasing the maximum prison sentence from 3 to 5 years and from 3 to 7 years on social media, as well as increasing the maximum sentence for hooliganism committed as part of a criminal group from 5 to 7 years in prison without parole. The vote took place during a plenary session ahead of the election on 9 March 2023, with Interior Minister Marat Ahmetjanov expressing support for the legislation. The bill was subsequently signed into law by President Tokayev on 17 March. Electoral fraud allegations. Concerns about electoral fraud arose ahead of the election, after photos circulating on social media from several polling stations in Shymkent had allegedly shown the existence of voting results protocols completed with numbers indicating the votes cast for each candidate shortly before polls were opened to the public. Ömir Şynybekuly, an independent candidate running in Shymkent II, called on the Prosecutor General\\'s Office to intervene and urged President Tokayev to temporarily suspend the powers of the Shymkent City Akimat. In response, the Shymkent Territorial Election Commission chairman Qaiybek Qunanbaev dismissed the claims of prepared voting protocol results as being \"fake stuffing and provocation\", insisting that election protocols are filled after voting takes place and noted the absence of a seal in the alleged precinct result tallies.After polls opened on election day, independent monitoring NGO Erkindik Qanaty claimed election violations, which included restrictions on observer movements, limited visibility of the voter registration process, bans on photo and video recording, campaign activities by the precinct election commission chairman, and failure to provide an observer\\'s chair which served as a violation of instructions for equipping the polling station. Voting irregularities emerged across Kazakhstan, with numerous videos captured by independent observers showing instances of ballot box stuffing and carousel voting taking place in polling stations. Others at several polling sites witnessed surveillance cameras being covered with tape. Azamat Sarğazin, head of the Public Interest Protection Service of the Prosecutor General\\'s Office, reported that 18 members of the election commission were fined and suspended due to election violations involving in issuing voting ballots to people for relatives. CEC chairman Nurlan Äbdirov, acknowledging the possible vote tampering, requested the Prosecutor General\\'s Office for \"an inspection and legal assessment\" of widespread irregularities. The Prosecutor General\\'s Office in the aftermath of the vote, registered a total of 40 violations during election day, upon which included election campaigning after its prohibition period. Conduct. Elections in Kazakhstan are prepared and conducted and by various bodies of election commissions.In a meeting held on 20 January 2023, the Central Election Commission (CEC) discussed a series of issues in relation to the appointment of elections, approval of a timetable, establishment of election document forms, and the activities of election observers from foreign states and international organisations, as well foreign media representatives. Public funding. The Ministry of Finance on 19 January 2023 announced that a total amount of 33.4 billion tenge originally would be spent for the 2023 election, a higher number than the 2022 presidential election funding, to which the Finance Ministry assessed that the costs for the snap election are included as part of the draft 2023–2025 budget and that the spending amount was initially reserved for 2025 fiscal year. According to the Ministry, the increased public expenses are taken into account for the introduction of a mixed electoral system.On 8 February 2023, the CEC confirmed that 33.4 billion tenge were officially allocated for the election. Voter registration. By 1 July and 1 January every year, information on voters and the boundaries of polling stations are submitted by the local executive bodies (akimats) in electronic form to their territorial election commissions, which ensure the verification and submission of information to the higher election commissions. There were approximately 11,976,406 registered voters in Kazakhstan as of 1 January 2023.Voter registration in Kazakhstan is conducted by a local executive body from the moment of announcement or appointment of elections and are compiled within the voter list, which are based on place of residence in the territory of the given electoral precinct. The voter list for each polling station is approved by the akim (local head), who issues an ordinance twenty days (27 February 2023) before the election.To vote absentee, a voter must notify the äkimat no later than thirty days (17 February 2023) before the election by applying their current place of residence for inclusion in a voter list at a different polling station. From 4 March 2023, absentee ballots began to be issued out to voters, which would take place until 18:00 local time on 18 March. In total, 22,578 absentee ballots were issued by the precinct election commissions based on voters\\' written applications.As of 26 February 2023, the number of registered voters reached 12,032,550 people, upon which were all subsequently included in electoral rolls according to the data transferred by the akimats.  Fifteen days before election day (from 4 March 2023), Kazakh citizens were given an opportunity to verify themselves in voter listing for their respective polling stations. According to deputy chairman of the CEC, Konstantin Petrov, the informational data on registered voters will be transferred and protected by the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry, which would inform Kazakh citizens about their voter listing inclusion via SMS messaging.On 17 March 2023, it was announced that Kazakh citizens without a residence permit would be allowed in registering to vote at 118 polling stations across the country on election day from 7:00 to 20:00 local time. The JSC Government for Citizens employees provided this service to allow citizens to exercise their voting and constitutional rights to which the polling stations included educational facilities, though voters who registered there were subsequently automatically deregistered after the election on March 20. COVID-19 guidelines. During the CEC briefing on 23 January 2023, Chief Sanitary Doctor of Kazakhstan Aijan Esmağambetova addressed the epidemiological situation regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in which she noted a decrease in COVID-19 cases within the last two weeks though did not rule out the seasonal rise of the virus along with influenza infections. While Kazakhstan was classified under low-risk \"green zone\" nationwide in relation to the level of COVID-19\\'s transmission, seven regions (cities of Shymkent, Almaty, and Atyrau; East Kazakhstan Region, Karaganda Region, Kostanay Region, and Mangystau Region) had the reproductive rate of the virus (R indicator) above one, which recommended face coverings in crowded settings. When taking into account of these indications, Esmağambetova recommended for political organisations to hold events within spacious premises, upon which should be provided uninterrupted functioning of the ventilation system as well as urging residents living in the regions under the R-indicator above one to mask up in crowded areas.Prior to the vote, Esmağambetova warned that a new mixed electoral system would lead to an increased voter turnout and in response, she called to regulate the flow of people in polling stations, as well as continuous function of ventilation/AC at the rate of 4 sq/m, and regulatory sanitation of election premises during voting day. Disabled voters. In an effort to ensure the rights of disabled persons, the CEC on 27 January 2023 adopted a resolution which recommended for local executive bodies (akimats) to ensure and assist election commissions in providing voting conditions for people with disabilities at polling stations, checking the accessibility of polling stations with the participation of representatives from public associations of persons with disabilities, as well as provide additional measures to ensure special conditions. The CEC had also recommended for Kazakh citizens, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and akimats to update disabled voters\\' information, as well as locations of polling stations in the Interactive Accessibility Map.On 27 February 2023, CEC chairman Nurlan Äbdirov revealed that polling stations would be equipped with all necessary conditions for persons with visual impairments, which would additional lighting and magnifiers. Preparations. On 23 January 2023, the CEC unveiled its main direction by prioritising the improvement of the \"legal literacy and electoral culture\" for all participants in the election process which included in conducting training and education for all nationwide election commission members in under following areas:. Online workshop meetings;. Field training and inspection workshop meetings in the regions;. Distance learning and testing;. Workshops for members of election commissions based on regional branches of the Academy of Public Administration under the President;. Field training workshop meetings and trainings by territorial election commission (TEC) members;. Workshops for members of 69 precinct election commissions formed at Kazakhstan\\'s overseas representative offices.Since the beginning of the election campaign, 230 call centers aimed at informing Kazakh citizens regarding their inclusion into electoral rolls were established in all regions of Kazakhstan, to which it received more than 17,000 requests by late February 2023.The CEC approved five voting ballot designs for the 2023 election on 27 February, including blue-coloured ballots (party voting) and green-coloured ballots (constituency vote). For the first time, an ISO 216 paper format would be used as voting ballots for a better visual readability, in which party list vote ballots would contain eight columns and the constituency vote ballots include up to 16 candidate names. The CEC also established that the total number of printed paper ballots for the legislative elections would be based on the total number of registered voters (12,032,550 people), including an excess of 1% of the registered voting population, which would amount to 12,152,876 pieces for each party and constituency voting ballots.On 27 February 2023, Vice Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry Äset Turysov announced that starting 6 March 2023, the Unified Platform of Internet Resources of State Bodies along with eGov.kz will launch the \"Search for a polling station through Individual Identification Number (IIN)\" system, as well as SMS notifications to mobile users. That same day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the formation of 77 polling stations in 62 countries for overseas voting, in which the ministerial representative Aibek Smadiarov urged Kazakh citizens wishing to take part in the election to contact and provide information to the foreign consular representation or institution of Kazakhstan to be included in their voter listing.In total, 10,223 polling stations were formed for the election as summed up both domestically and aboard. Election day. In the early dawn of 19 March 2023, polling stations began operating in Kazakhstan starting at 7:00 local time (with exception of 92 precincts being opened an hour earlier on 6:00 under the decision of territorial election commissions). As of 7:15 UTC+6, there were 8,272 polling stations functioning mostly in the eastern portion of Kazakhstan due to time differences as the regions of Aqtobe, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, Qyzylorda and Mangystau would start voting an hour later according to the Astana time zone. During that period, President Tokayev himself had voted hours earlier in the Palace of Schoolchildren than previously anticipated, upon which the news of his vote was revealed later. According to the Ministry of Information and Social Development, the reasoning of Tokayev voting earlier was due to changes in his \"work schedule\" and that information was intentionally left unreported to the public. By 8:15 UTC+6, all of 10,146 polling stations were operating domestically. Former president Nursultan Nazarbayev had also made his public appearance after showing up to vote, to which he congratulated everyone for upcoming Nowruz holiday. As of 19:00 UTC+6, all 10,223 election precincts were in service as every overseas voting site had been opened in accordance with their respective time zones. The duration of the voting period lasted 13 hours, with polling stations being closed on 20:00 local time.The CEC began reporting its first voter turnout numbers for 10:00 UTC+6 and continued so every two hours until 22:00 evening time, when it presented the conclusive preliminary data of the national election turnout number of 54.2% (6,521,860 voters). Vote counting took place in every precinct starting 24:00 UTC+6 and was set to last until 08:00 UTC+6, 20 March 2023. From there, the CEC had also announced that it would address the preliminary results of the legislative election in the same following day. Observation. Prior to the 2022 presidential election, the Parliament adopted new amendments to the election law, which tightened requirements of the accreditation process of public associations and NGOs to observe elections. According to Roman Reimer, co-founder of the NGO Erkindik Qanaty, the newly imposed laws would lead to a more difficult process of election accreditation and likely lead to a \"destruction of independent observation\", as well as severely restrict the election monitoring job at the polling stations.On 20 January 2023, the Central Election Commission (CEC) Secretary Muqtar Erman announced in the opening of the Institution for International Election Observation, to which the CEC sent invitations to international, interparliamentary organisations, as well as the diplomatic corps in Kazakhstan to participate in monitoring for the 2023 election in order to meet international obligations in ensuring \"openness and transparency during the electoral campaign\". By 2 February 2023, the CEC accredited first 25 observers from Palestine and two international organisations of CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).By 13 March 2023, the CEC accredited a total of 793 election observers from 41 foreign countries and 12 international organisations. OSCE. By invitation by the CEC, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on 8 February 2023 opened its election observation mission in Kazakhstan, headed by Eoghan Murphy, which consisted of its core team of 11 international experts based in Astana, as well as 32 long-term observers that would be deployed throughout the country from 17 February. The ODIHR also announced in plans to deploy 300 short-term observers several days before election day.In an interim report published on 3 March 2023, the OSCE described the election campaigning in Kazakhstan as being \"lively\", specifically on social media and in single-member electoral districts where large number of candidates took part in the race, while raising concerns on numerous cases of \"intimidation and harassment of critical online journalists and bloggers\" which had formed a \"perception of impunity and contribute to widespread self-censorship.\"The OSCE in its preliminary finding praised the electoral preparations as being \"administered efficiently and within the established deadlines\", though noted lack of consistency and timely addressment of vote counting and tabulation as International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) observers consistently noted \"discrepancies between the number of voters casting their ballots and the officially reported preliminary turnout figures\", as observers reported in either facing restrictions or having an unclear view of the counting procedures and ballot column marks, thus raising serious concerns regarding the integrity of the election counting process. Debates. On 27 February 2023, the first televised debates between political parties were announced to be broadcast by the Qazaqstan channel, to which it was scheduled to be held for 1 March 2023 with the debates also being livestreamed on YouTube, Facebook, and Telegram channels of Qazaqstan. Representatives of all seven contesting parties took part in the 1 March election debate. The debate was comprised of four stages where party representatives answered a common political question briefly twice, asked and responded to each other\\'s questions, and lastly with the representatives personally addressing voters. At the debate stage, a variety of issues were raised by the speakers in relation to societal injustice, improvement of working conditions, educational gap between urban and rural areas, raising of minimum wage, environmental protection, entrepreneurship development, and combatting corruption. The first televised debate discussion was noted to have completely neglected sensitive topics such as 2022 unrest and its aftermath investigation of victims\\' death, as well as issues of ongoing human rights violations in Kazakhstan, with the podium speakers unusually interrupting each other and violating the debate rules.A second debate was announced on 6 March 2023 by the KTK channel to be held on 10 March in all its livestream platforms, to which the televised debate consisted of three stages starting with the party participants presenting their theses of the election programs, asking each other questions, and in the final stage making appeal to the voters. During the debate, People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev made a notable proposal in forming a coalition government alongside the parties of Auyl and Baytaq.The Central Election Commission (CEC) on 27 February 2023 had scheduled its third pre-election debate to take place on 16 March 2023, to which approximately 63 million tenge was allocated towards the hosting Khabar Agency for its televised debates between party representatives. On 7 March, the CEC approved a list of participants representing the parties at the podium, which initially included QHP chairman Ertisbaev as an invitee, but instead later having QHP member Oksana Äubäkirova representing the party. During the debate, consisting of three rounds, the speakers introduced their party ideologies, asked questions to their opponents, discussed party policies for developing Kazakhstan\\'s socioeconomic status, and answered questions from the Khabar Agency\\'s cell center, with the third and final round concluding with addresses from each party representative.A debate consisting of independent candidates in a YouTube livestream were also hosted by the Orda.kz on 3 March 2023.. Opinion polls. During an online survey conducted in the 10 March 2023 debate, a majority of KTK channel respondents viewed Amanat to be the general winner of all the participating parties. Opinion polls. Opinion polling in Kazakhstan may only be conducted by legal firms that are registered in accordance with the law of having at least five years of experience in conducting public surveys and had notified the Central Election Commission (CEC) of the polling firm\\'s specialists and their experience along with the locations where they are conducted, and the analysis methods used. It is prohibited for pollsters to publish opinion survey results on the internet regarding the election of candidates and political parties five days before voting begins (from 14 March 2023) as well as on election day at premises or in polling stations.In addition, independent polling is severely restricted in Kazakhstan, as Deputy Prosecutor General Jandos Ömiräliev on 18 February 2023 reported a number of unauthorised conducts of opinion polls, including one individual being fined under the decision by the prosecutor of Saryarqa District in Astana. Änuarbek Sqaqov, member of the Kazakhstan Union of Lawyers central council, argued that public opinion should be done so without conducting online polls on social media and instead be carried out only by certain organisations accredited with the CEC, to which he insisted that it would supposedly prevent the \"abuse or manipulation of public opinion\".Political scientist Talğat Qaliev forecast that the ruling Amanat party would retain its party of power status in the 2023 election due to its \"extensive network of branches\" and prominent political figures in the party, followed by the Auyl party within the second place of the vote in which he cited the party\\'s electorate support from a large-sized rural base. Exit polls. During election day, exit polls are conducted by members from legal organisations within and outside the premises of polling stations, to which Janar Muqanova, head of the Centre for Electoral Training of the Academy of Public Administration under the President, argued that a registration barrier provides a \"good management\" in professionally conducting sociological surveys. Organisations conducting exit polls publish their results after election day and within 12 hours after the announcements of preliminary results by the CEC.After midnight on 20 March 2023, exit polls reported by Kazakh media indicated that the ruling Amanat party had won the majority of the vote share. Analysts forecasted that around five or six other parties would earn representation after surpassing the electoral threshold, with the opposition Nationwide Social Democratic Party on the uncertain edge of the threshold barrier. As the only party contesting the election but not surpassing the threshold, Baytaq was viewed to have no chances of entering the parliament. Results. In the early morning of 20 March 2023, the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced the preliminary election results summed up from electronic copies of the voting result protocols by the territorial and district election commissions. From there, the ruling Amanat party had officially won majority of 53.9% of the proportional vote share, marking it one of the worst performances for the party since the 1999 legislative election. In the constituencies, the preliminary results showed the Amanat party winning an overwhelming majority of 22 seats (+1 independent candidate affiliated with the party) out of a total of 29 contested seats, leaving the rest of seven mandates to be won by independents in their representing electoral districts.The final results of the 2023 legislative election were published by the CEC on 27 March 2023, revealing the upcoming seating composition of the 8th Majilis according to party-list, with the ruling Amanat party winning 40 seats, followed by Auyl with 8 seats, Respublica and Aq Jol with 6 seats each, the People\\'s Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) with 5 seats, and the opposition Nationwide Social Democratic Party (JSDP) secured 4 seats, while Baytaq failed to surpass the 5% electoral threshold. Mäjilis. Voter turnout. Results by region. Constituency vote. Party-list vote. Aftermath. In a speech given during the Nowruz celebration event in Astana on 21 March 2023, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev praised the results of the legislative election as being \"a very important step forward for all reforms\" and \"a worthy continuation of large-scale changes\", marking personally that Kazakhstan had \"entered a new era\" with its newly formed political image as part of his successfully implemented one-year political reform plan, while completely ignoring reports of widespread electoral fraud allegations. Tokayev described the election as being a \"historic moment\" symbolising the \"Great Day of the Nation\". Analysis. The 2023 election marked a shift in the national political landscape of Kazakhstan in post-Nazarbayev era, as the ruling Amanat party lost its supermajority status and was left with a simple majority for the first time since 2004 after losing 14 seats, with other contesting parties such as Auyl and Respublica emerging as the main frontrunning minor parties after entering the parliament and overtaking Aq Jol and QHP as the major minor parties in the election (which had held their statuses since previously entering the Mäjilis in 2012). For the first time since 2004, independent candidates as well as politicians affiliated with opposition JSDP were also elected to the parliament. Despite the outlook of the election results, the status of JSDP as an opposition party was met with skepticism, particularly according to Mikhail Rozov from Ritm Eurasia, who described the JSDP as being an opposition party only with \"a very big stretch\".Various pro-government commentators praised the elections in a positive outlook. Political scientist Talgat Qaliev from the Institute of Ethno-Political Studies, believed that the election results would increase the \"level of pluralism\". Erlan Ahmedi, political scientist and chief expert of the Institute of Public Policy, described the 2023 election as being \"unusual\", voicing his belief on the continued process of democratization in Kazakhstan and predicting that the next legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 2028 and 2029, respectively, would be \"even more interesting\".The legislative election results were also met with varied forms of skepticism and doubts. Political scientist Dosym Sätbaev had consistently described the election results as being a \"political hoax\" with the ruling Amanat party\\'s victory as being intentionally pre-planned in parr with \"Aqorda\\'s script\", and that the parliamentary elections were part of the chain of events that occurred since the January 2022 unrest, as any possibilities of an aftermath political reform had been \"finally slammed shut\". Sätbaev also did not rule out claims of the election results being falsified. Shalkar Nurseitov, a political analyst and director of the Center for Policy Solutions in Kazakhstan, had asserted that aftermath of the legislative election \"sends a message to the elites and the international community\" in completion of President Tokayev\\'s concentration of power in his hands. Raqym Oşaqbaev, economist and director of the Center for Applied Research TALAP, suggested that the newly elected parliament would not change as it would be continued to be in control by the \"influence of the pro-government bureaucratic nomenclature\", fearing that Kazakhstan is doomed to \"further degradation and aggravation of the crisis\". Catherine Putz from The Diplomat, noted the low electoral turnout as being an indication of \"lack of enthusiasm\" amongst Kazakh voters and raised concerns regarding the legislative work done by newly elected independents as well as potentially unified parliamentary opposition against the ruling Amanat party, to which she expressed doubts that any of minor parties in the Mäjilis would challenge the \"status quo\" and that the parliament overall would \"resemble its former self\".Alexander Kireev, creator of the Electoral Geography project, expressed concerns over the official election results that exhibited a pattern of consistently high percentages of votes received by each party ending in repeating decimals rounded to hundredths (ex. 53.900% of votes for Amanat), to which Kireev suggested that this pattern of election results as well as voter turnout number could be an indication that the votes were not based on tallies from local precincts, but instead were fabricated separately by an unknown entity. Election results complaints and lawsuits. On 19 March 2023, independent opposition candidates Muhtar Taijan and Sanjar Boqaev filed lawsuits to the Almaty administrative court, requesting the election results to be declared as illegal. In a following press conference held on 20 March, Taijan as well as Mäjilis candidate Inga Imanbai expressed their dissatisfaction with the official results, alleging of election irregularities. Imanbai announced her intent to challenge the election results, accusing Kazakh authorities of rigging votes in favour her challenger, Ermurat Bapi. She alleged that the authorities covered up the ballot boxes, urged public servants to vote for specific candidates, and claimed her campaign observers were facing pressure and were removed from polling stations. Erlan Stambekov, an official winner for Electoral district No. 4 of Almaty, was presumably shown to have actually taken only third place in the results within the constituency according to his losing candidate, Boqaev, who claimed of processing voting result protocols sent via WhatsApp that showed him winning the race with 4,459 votes compared to 2,825 votes cast for Stambekov. In Shymkent and Turkistan Region, a group of independent candidates, most notably Nūrjan Ältaev, had also sought to challenge the results of the election, to which they demanded re-election and requested President Tokayev to intervene in the issue. Ältaev, in possession of numerous voting protocol records from his electoral district, argued that he had received majority of 35,178 votes in comparison to his official winning rival, Temir Qyryqbaev, who garnered 32,251 votes. Independent Mäjilis candidate Luqpan Ahmediarov from West Kazakhstan Region, criticised the election results after losing to Abzal Quspan in Electoral district No. 14, to which election protocols collected in Oral by the Jaria public fund observers, had shown Ahmediarov winning 14,816 of votes contrary to Quspan\\'s 8,922 votes. In response, Ahmediarov announced that he would appeal the official results of the vote. Marina Shiller, Aq Jol candidate in Karaganda Region, support the idea of holding a re-election as she claimed of receiving lots of personal contacts from residents that claimed to have voted for her in the election.Despite widespread allegations and disputes over the election results from journalists and public figures, Bulat Abilov expressed doubt in a potential election audit in a Deutsche Welle interview, suggesting that it would only result in the punishment or reassignment of some election officials. Daniar Äşimbaev, a political analyst, also expressed doubts about the possibility of an audit and any potential consequences for President Tokayev\\'s reputation as he cited the election losses for government critics. Opening of 8th Parliament and government formation. Under the 2017 amendment adopted during Nursultan Nazarbayev\\'s presidency, Article 67(4) of the Constitution of Kazakhstan obliges the Prime Minister and his cabinet to resign in advance of the newly elected Mäjilis. Prime Minister Älihan Smaiylov on 19 March 2023 announced that his cabinet would step down after the election. On 27 March, President Tokayev signed a decree in convening the first session of the 8th Parliament for 29 March.On 29 March 2023, at the first plenary session of the 8th Mäjilis, MP and Amanat chairman Erlan Qoşanov was reappointed as the Mäjilis chairman in a unanimous vote, with MPs of Albert Rau (Amanat) and Dania Espaeva (Aq Jol) being elected to serve as his deputies. From there, the Smaiylov government announced of its resignation, leading for President Tokayev in appointing a caretaker government with Smaiylov serving as acting prime minister. Qoşanov at a following press briefing revealed that the party faction of Amanat would nominate its prime ministerial candidate in the \"coming days\". Speculations arose during Smaiylov\\'s short tenure as prime minister about his chances of staying in the position, with political scientist Andrei Chebotarev noting that Smaiylov began his premiership by stabilizing Kazakhstan after the January 2022 unrest but the list of potential replacements was small, and also pointed out Tokayev\\'s new agenda and previous criticisms of the government as factors contributing to the uncertainty surrounding Smaiylov\\'s future.The following day on 30 March 2023, Qoşanov in a meeting with Tokayev unveiled Smaiylov\\'s candidacy by the Amanat party for his reappointment as prime minister. From there, Tokayev held talks with the party faction leaders of Mäjilis, where Tokayev endorsed Smaiylov for prime ministerial post, stating his awareness of \"challenges facing the government\". Smaiylov\\'s candidacy was supported by an overwhelming majority of Mäjilis deputies, with seven voting against, most notably from the opposition Nationwide Social Democratic Party MPs. As a result of the parliamentary vote, Tokayev signed a decree in officially reappointing Smaiylov as the prime minister, thus leading to a formation of the Second Smaiylov government. Under changes following subsequent cabinet ministerial appointments, the government composition featured two (or 8.6%) new ministers out of 23 cabinet officials.

ruling Amanat party received widespread attention from social media after the party\\\\\\'s election advertisement was spotted being illegally installed on several public billboard displays in Karaganda, a day in advance by the required law.[221] In response to the backlash, the Amanat party\\\\\\'s regional branch acknowledging the violation of the election law in an official statement, revealed that its campaign banner was hung by its advertising contractors and that the banner was subsequently removed within 30 minutes after the party\\\\\\'s regional branch responded to the complaints.[222] The party also announced that it would it take legal action and unilaterally terminate its contract with the service providers behind the incident.[223][224] Opposition activist and independent MP candidate, Sanjar Boqaev, criticised the ruling Amanat party following the incident, in which he called for the party to be barred from participating in the elections, citing the legal provision within the election law in regard to its violation.[225]\\\\nSeveral opposition candidates also had come under scrutiny by the Kazakh prosecutors, due to allegedly violating election laws as well such as independents Marat Jylanbaev,[226] Amangeldi Jahin,[226] and Jasulan Aitma?anbetov,[227] by which they were accused of illegally conducting their agitation on social media during the pre-campaign timeframe of the election and in result, faced fines and revoking of their candidacy registration.[228] Despite the punishments, the independent candidates dismissed the court\\\\\\'s rulings, insisted that communication on social media was not legally defined as an \"agitation\".[228] Temirtas Synmetullaev, deputy candidate from Karaganda, received a fine on 2 March 2023 due to his pre-campaign Facebook posts in which he denied accusations, claiming the use of alleged photoshopping over his posted words.[229]\\\\nThe Prosecutor General\\\\\\'s Office of Kazakhstan issued a conclusive report on 17 March, stating 23 election law violations, mainly related to prohibited campaigning (such as unnamed candidates providing free taxi rides or sand- gravel mixture services), unauthorized independent polling, and distribution of anonymous or vandalizing campaign materials.[230][231][232]\\', \\'A number of candidates who were mostly independents were barred and even excluded from the national and local elections despite previously overgoing the registration requirements, mainly due to their tax noncompliances to even allegations of copyright infringements as well by the courts.[233][234] Deputy PM and Finance Minister Erulan Jamaubaev denied any political motivations for the refusals in registration of independent candidates for the election, adding that the State Revenue Committee would verify mistakes in the candidates\\\\\\' financial declarations.[235][236]\\\\nCivil activist ?iger?m T?leujan originally had her candidacy rejected by the Almaty\\\\\\'s District Election Commission No. 3 on 17 February 2023, due to her electoral registration fee being deemed not authentic as T?leujan was under investigation by the Kazakh authorities for allegedly inciting an attack on the Almaty International Airport during the January 2022 unrest.[237] In an appeal effort, T?leujan successfully won a lawsuit against the district election commission\\\\\\'s decision in a ruling made by the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan on 27 February, thus essentially becoming a registered candidate in the election.[238] However on 11 March 2023, T?leujan was once again removed from the race by the district election commission, due to \"discrepancies\" in her tax returns.[239] Qaiyr?ali K?neev, a physician and public figure, was denied registration as an independent MP candidate on the absurd basis of leaving Kazakhstan and never returning despite having to physically lived and worked in Almaty the whole time, in which K?neev ironically demanded to be awarded and nominated for the Nobel Prize as being the world\\\\\\'s first teleported person.[240]\\\\nIn response to increasing pressure by the Kazakh government over its removal of independent candidates, opposition activists in a press conference on 9 March 2023 voiced their concerns over the issue, complaining about being \"illegally alienated\" from the elections and that the decision was unfounded, an allegation that was dismissed by the CEC member ?avkat ?temisov as he suggested for candidates to instead \"appeal to the court and try again to participate in the elections.\"[241] On 17 March, the CEC reported that a total of 166 complaints were filed to the courts by the removed candidates and that only six of the candidates had their registration successfully reinstated.[242] According to Asylbek Aijaryquly, member of the CEC, an \"objective decision\" regarding the removal of independent candidates will be determined by a court case.[243]\\\\nThe frequent changes to the list of candidates posed challenges in preparing the voting ballots, as some candidates who had withdrawn from their constituent races were mistakenly included in the thousands of already printed ballots near election day.[244] In Almaty, the chairwoman of the territorial election commission, Aigül Qalyqova, explained that election commission members were required by law to manually cross out the names of

accused the Kazakh government of refusing its citizens in showing support for the Ukrainian people.[247] Nevertheless, Imanbai initially pledged to hold an anti-war speech instead in her election headquarters office.[248] On 27 February, Imanbai reported that she was summoned by the police due to inciting a \"national animus\" after holding a single picket protest in the office of Human Rights

on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General\\\\\\'s Office against ?oraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology.[281][282] ?oraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.[283]\\\\nOn 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against ?oraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party,

for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up.[285][286] On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found ?oraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by

      "{'input': ' Summary. A Gest of Robyn Hood is divided into eight fyttes (sections) that tell interleaving stories of Robin and his band.  Jess Bessinger Jr divided Gest into four tales based on the characters that feature in them, each with several episodes, although the beginning and end of a tale or episode does not always align with the fyttes.  Bessinger\\'s divisions are as follows:. Robin Hood, Knight, and Abbot (Tale A: Fytte 1, 2, and 4). Robin Hood, Little John, Sheriff, and Knight (Tale B: Fytte 3, 5, and 6). Robin Hood, Knight, and King (Tale C: Fytte 7 and the first half of 8). Death of Robin Hood (Tale D: The second half of fytte 8)Quotes from the text have been given with modern spelling. First Fytte. Robin Hood, a good yeoman and courteous outlaw, has heard 3 masses this morning: one to honour God the Father; one to honour the Holy Ghost; and one to honour the Virgin Mary, for whom he has a deep devotion. He has fasted since midnight, and Little John, also a good yeoman, suggests he should eat soon. Robin declines to dine without a guest to pay for the feast. He sends his men to find one and reminds them to do no harm to farmers, yeomen or gentlemen, but to rob bishops, archbishops and the Sheriff of Nottingham should they encounter them. Little John, Much the Miller\\'s son and William Scarlock leave to search for a guest.. They see a knight on horseback in a back street in Barnsdale. He looks forlorn, slouched over in his saddle, his face careworn and streaked with tears. Little John approaches the Sorrowful Knight, genuflects, and welcomes him to the forest, saying his Master Robin Hood is waiting dinner for him. The Knight remarks \"He is good yeoman ... /Of him I have heard much good.\":\\u200alines 103-104\\u200a The Knight leaves with the outlaws. When Robin Hood sees the Sorrowful Knight, he pushes back his hood, and genuflects to him. They all wash, and sit down to a fine feast. They enjoy plenty of bread and wine, along with deer sweatbreads, pheasants, swans, and other river birds. The Knight remarks that he had not had such a dinner for weeks, and should he pass through this way again, he would return the favour. Robin retorts that the Knight should pay before he leaves, as it is not proper for a yeoman to pay for a knight\\'s feast. The Sorrowful Knight says he has only 10 shillings, and is embarrassed to offer such a small amount. Little John checks his baggage, and verifies the Sorrowful Knight is truthful.. Robin remarks on the Sorrowful Knight\\'s threadbare clothing, and inquires about his situation. the Sorrowful Knight responds that his ancestors have been knights for 100 years but now he is disgraced, because his son and heir killed a knight of Lancaster. To redeem him, the Sorrowful Knight borrowed 400 pounds from the Rich Abbot of St Mary\\'s, using his lands as collateral. The loan is now due, but he has only 10 shillings, so his lands will be seized by the Abbot. Robin asks if he had any friends. The Knight replies that he had plenty when he was rich, but none that he is poor. Robin then asks if he has anybody who could offer collateral. The Knight replied that he had none \"But if it be Our dear Lady;/She failed me never or this day.\":\\u200alines 259-60\\u200a Robin, who has a deep devotion to the Virgin Mary, declares that she is the best collateral in all of England. He instructs Little John to fetch 400 pounds from their treasure chest, and pay the Knight. Emboldened by Robin\\'s words, Little John suggests new livery in Robin\\'s colours of scarlet and green, and a new horse. Robin offers a grey courser with a new saddle; after all, he says, the Knight is the Virgin Mary\\'s messenger. Much suggests a good palfrey, Scarlock suggests new boots, and Little John suggests shining spurs. Robin adds that a knight can not ride alone, and offers Little John as a companion.:\\u200alines 1-324\\u200a \"In a yeoman\\'s stead he may thee stand,/If thou great need have.\":\\u200alines 323-24 Second Fytte. The scene switches to York, where the monks of St Mary\\'s Abbey are sitting down to dinner. The Abbot, the Prior, the Chief Steward, the Sheriff of Yorkshire, and the county Justice are discussing the Knight whose debt of 400 pounds is due today. The Prior observes that if it was him, he would pay 100 pounds now and the rest later. The Abbot remarks that the Knight is suffering hunger and cold while serving England\\'s cause overseas. The Prior admonishes the Abbot that, in that case, it would pitiful to take his land; but such a grievous wrong would not bother the Abbot\\'s conscience at all. The Abbot snaps back at the Prior, telling him he\\'s always getting in the way. The \"fat-headed\"[line 363] Chief Steward suggests that the Knight is either dead or hanged. The county Justice offers his opinion that the Knight will not come. They are all disappointed when the Knight appears at the gate.. The Knight genuflects and salutes them all \"great and small\":\\u200aline 408\\u200a. Upset at the Knight\\'s appearance in the Abbey hall, the Abbot skips the customary courtesies and demands if he brought the Abbot\\'s money. Not one penny, the Knight calmly replies. The Abbot snaps back, then why are you here? The Knight answers that he is here to beg for more time. The county Justice sharply interrupts, your time is up and your land is forfeit. Still on one knee, the Knight begs the Justice to \"be my frende\":\\u200aline 423\\u200a. The Justice responds that he can not; he is working on retainer from the Abbot. The Knight then looks to the Sheriff, who also refuses to aid the Knight. Finally the Knight offers his services as the Abbot\\'s Knight until the debt is paid. The Abbot rebukes the Knight\\'s offer. \"\\'Out,\\' he said, \\'thou false knight,/Speed thee out of my hall!\\'\":\\u200alines 451-2\\u200a The Knight calls the Abbot a liar, and stands up. As the Knight approaches, the Justice asks the Abbot how much would he give the Knight to purchase the land outright. 100 pounds is the Abbot\\'s reply; make it 200, insists the Justice. The Knight strides to the Abbot\\'s table, and shakes Robin\\'s 400 pounds out of the bag and onto the table. The Abbot is stunned. He tells the Justice to take the money as an additional retainer. The Justice refuses. The Knight then announces to everyone in the hall that he has paid his debt; his land is his once more. The Knight leaves, now carefree. He travels home with a light heart, singing. His worried wife meets him at the gate to Wyresdale. Be happy, my wife, says the Knight, and pray for Robin Hood; without his kindness, we would be beggars now.. Over the next year the Knight accumulates the 400 pounds to repay Robin Hood. He also purchases 100 bows, 100 bundles of arrows, 100 horses, and hires 100 men clothed in red and white clothing. On the day his debt is due, the Knight and his men head for Barnesdale. At Wentbridge, they pass a fair where a stranger has won the wrestling match. The yeoman is in danger of being killed by the crowd. Remembering how Robin treated him, he orders his company to surround the yeoman, shouting that no harm would befall him. He purchases a cask of wine and breaks it open so that all may drink. But the Knight and his company stay until the fair is done to ensure the yeoman\\'s safety. In the meantime, Robin Hood is waiting under the tree in the greenwood.:\\u200alines 325-572 Third Fytte. It is now autumn.:\\u200aline 704\\u200a Little John is still the Knight\\'s Yeoman, and joins other young men in longbow target practice. Three times Little John shoots; three times he \"split the wand\":\\u200aline 582\\u200a. The Sheriff of Nottingham is impressed. He approaches Little John, asking his name and birthplace. Little John replies, Reynold Greenleaf of Holderness. The Sheriff then asks Little John to work for him. Only if the Sheriff obtains a leave of absence from the Knight, Little John advises. The Knight agrees, and Little John rides off on one of the Sheriff\\'s good strong horses. One day the Sheriff goes hunting and leaves Little John behind. It is now past noon, and Little John has not eaten. Little John asks the steward for dinner, but is told not until the Sheriff comes home. Little John then threatens the butler, and gives him a strong blow to his back. The butler runs to the pantry and shuts the door. Little John kicks the door open and drinks more than his share of the ale and wine.. The Sheriff\\'s Cook, a bold stout man, confronts Little John. The Cook delivers three strong blows to Little John, who vows that he won\\'t leave until he pays the Cook back. They both draw swords and fight for an hour, with neither gaining the advantage. Little John acknowledges that the Cook is the best swordsman he has ever seen; if he is as good with the bow, the Cook could join with Robin Hood. The Cook agrees. Little John and the Cook sit down to a fine dinner. Then they break the lock on the Sheriff\\'s treasury and steal all the silver dinnerware plus 300 pounds in coin. They leave immediately to meet Robin Hood.. After they greet each other, Robin Hood inquires as who is \"that fair yeoman\":\\u200aline 709\\u200a accompanying Little John, and what is the news from Nottingham. Little John responds that the proud Sheriff sends his greetings, his Cook, his silver tableware, and 300 pounds in coin. Robin replies sarcastically that it wasn\\'t because of the Sheriff\\'s generosity. Little John has a sudden thought to trick the Sheriff. He runs 5 miles to meet the Sheriff, hunting with his hounds. Where have you been, demands the Sheriff. In this forest, replies Little John, I have seen a green hart, with a herd of 140 deer. The Sheriff exclaims, that would be a sight to see! Then quickly follow me, says Little John. When they meet Robin and his 140 men, Little John announces that here is the master hart and his herd of deer! The Sheriff is amazed by how Little John has betrayed him. It\\'s your fault, says Little John, I never got my dinner at your place.. The Sheriff sits down to dinner, and is horrified when he realizes he is eating from his own silver tableware. Robin says, consider it charity, and for Little John\\'s sake, I grant you your life. When dinner was done, Robin tells Little John to strip the Sheriff of his fur-lined mantle and all his fine clothes, and wrap him in a green mantle. Robin then orders the Sheriff\\'s men to do likewise, and lie down next to the Sheriff. All night they lie on the cold ground in only their breeches, shirts, and the green mantles. The next morning, the  Sheriff complains about his stiff muscles. Don\\'t complain, replies Robin, this is how we live; he continues, for the next year, I will teach you how to live as an outlaw. The Sheriff grumbles, not for all the gold in England. He pleads with Robin to let him go. Robin demands that he swear an oath on Robin\\'s sword that he will never again harm Robin or any of his men. The Sheriff swears his oath, and leaves the greenwood.:\\u200alines 573-816 Fourth Fytte. It is now one year later. The scene is Robin Hood and Little John in the greenwood. Little John suggests that it is time for dinner, but Robin declines. He fears the Virgin Mary is angry with him, since the Knight has not yet arrived. Little John consoles him, saying that the sun has not yet set, and the Knight is true to his word. Robin instructs Little John to take Much and William Scarlok, and search for an \"unknown guest\"[line ??]. Irritated, Little John takes up his bow and his sword to do Robin\\'s bidding. On the highway in Barnesdale they spot a monk on a good palfrey. Little John remarks to Much, here is our pay. The monk is being escorted by 52 men and seven pack horses. Little John tells his companions to prepare for an ambush. He aims his arrow at the monk, ordering him to stop where he is. Calling him a churlish monk, Little John accuses the Monk of angering his master, Robin Hood. \"\"He is a strong thief,\" said the monk,/\"Of him heard I never good.\"\":\\u200alines 883-4\\u200a. Much lets fly an arrow which barely misses the Monk\\'s chest, and he quickly dismounts. All the attendants turn and flee, leaving only a little page and a groom with the pack horses.. Little John brings the Monk to the huntsman\\'s hut. Robin Hood lowers his hood, but the uncourteous Monk does not. Robin asks Little John how many men the monk had. 52 men, is his answer. Blow the horn, orders Robin. 140 men, dressed in striped scarlet, answer the call to run down the Monk\\'s attendants. Robin & Little John force the Monk to wash up for dinner, and they serve him at the table. While he is eating, Robin asks the Monk, to which abbey do you belong & what office do you hold. I am the Chief Steward of St Mary\\'s Abbey, answers the Monk.. Robin Hood is still worried that the Virgin Mary is angry with him, since the Knight has not yet appeared. Little John tells Robin not to worry, the Monk has brought the money; he is from her abbey. . Robin is not consoled. She was my collateral for a loan I made to the Knight, he says. Speaking to the Monk, Robin asks to see the silver - if he brought it. The Monk swears at Robin, saying he knows nothing of this loan. Robin Hood retorts: God is righteous, and so is the Virgin Mary, you are to blame; you are her servant, and her messenger. How much money do you carry, Robin Hood demands of the Monk. 20 marks of silver, he replies. Robin orders Little John to check the Monk\\'s baggage.. After laying out the contents of the Monk\\'s purse, Little John hurries back to Robin Hood. The Virgin Mary has doubled your money, he declares. Robin is elated. They all drink to her honour. Curious at what is in the packhorses, Robin again asks Little John to search again. The Monk protests strenuously, mounts his horse, and rides off.:\\u200alines 817-1040\\u200a. It is still daylight when the Knight rides into Barnesdale, and sees Robin Hood standing under the greenwood tree. The Knight dismounts, lowers his hood, and genuflects to Robin. Robin warmly welcomes him, and asks why he is so late. The Knight replies that he stopped to help a poor yeoman in trouble. In that case, rejoins Robin, for helping a good yeoman, I am your friend. The Knight offers the 400 pounds, and 20 marks more for Robin\\'s courtesy. He refuses, saying the money was already delivered by the Monk of St Mary\\'s. But the bows and arrows I brought are a poor payment, says the Knight. Robin sends Little John to retrieve 400 pounds of the Monk\\'s money, and then hands it to the Knight. Buy a horse and a good harness, he says, get some new clothing. And he adds, if ever you need spending money, come see me.:\\u200alines 1041-1120 Fifth Fytte. The Sheriff of Nottingham announces an archery contest for all the best archers of the North. The prize will be an arrow with a head and feathers of red gold, and a shaft of white silver. Upon hearing of the contest, Robin Hood calls his fellowship together. He orders that only six of his men shoot with him; the rest, with arrows nocked, are to keep watch on the Sheriff\\'s men.. Three times Robin shoots, and three times he splits the wand. But so did good Gilberte with the White Hand. The two shoot again, but Robin is best, and wins the prize. The outlaws begin their return to the greenwood, but the fair-goers shout and blow horns. The Sheriff\\'s men loose a hail of arrows, and Robin shouts curses at the Sheriff for breaking his pledge. Many of the fellowship are wounded, including Little John, who took an arrow to his knee. Little John begs Robin not to let the Sheriff take him alive - he tells Robin to inflict mortal wounds to his head. Robin replies, not for all the gold in England! God forbid that you should die, cries Much, and hefts Little John onto his back.. Not far away is the castle of Sir Richard at the Lee, the Sorrowful Knight. Immediately Sir Richard takes in Robin and his men. He orders the gates be shut, the bridge be drawn up, and the walls manned.:\\u200alines 1121-1264 Sixth Fytte. The High Sheriff of Nottingham raises a large army from around the countryside to besiege Sir Richard\\'s castle. Traitorous Knight, the proud Sheriff shouts to Sir Richard, you harbor the King\\'s enemy against the law. The Knight courteously agrees that he is doing so. Sir Richard adds, tell our King what has happened, and see what he says. The Sheriff rides to London, and tells the King that Sir Richard is supporting the outlaw band. Furthermore, he tells the King, Sir Richard is using the outlaws to set himself up as lord of the north land. The King said he would be in Nottingham in two weeks, and that the Sheriff is to gather more archers from all over the countryside. In the meantime, Robin Hood returns to the greenwood, where Little John later joins him after his knee heals.. Having missed his chance to capture Robin, the Sheriff lies in wait to capture Sir Richard instead. He finally overcomes the gentle Knight as he is hawking by the river, and takes him to Nottingham. When Sir Richard\\'s wife is told what has happened, she rides out to the greenwood to find Robin. For Our dear Lady\\'s sake, she implores Robin, don\\'t let my husband be killed for supporting you. Who took your lord, asks Robin. The Sheriff, she replies, and they are not more than three miles from here. Robin quickly gathers his men and they run towards Nottingham.. The fellowship catches up with the Sheriff. Robin stops the Sheriff, asking about the news from the King. Robin then quickly draws his bow, and lets loose an arrow that knocks the Sheriff off his horse. Before the Sheriff can rise, Robin beheads him with his sword. Lie there, proud Sheriff, taunts Robin, no man could trust you while you were alive.:\\u200alines 1265-1412\\u200aThe rest of the fellowship attack the Sheriff\\'s men and cut them down. Robin leaps to Sir Richard\\'s side, cuts his bonds, and hands him a bow. Come to the greenwood with me, Robin orders, until I can get us \"... grace/Of Edward, our comely king.\":\\u200alines 1411-12 Seventh Fytte. The King arrives at Nottingham and asks about Robin Hood and Sir Richard. Hearing what has happened, he seizes the Knight\\'s lands, and searches for Robin throughout Lancashire. Reaching Plompton Park, he notices that there are far fewer deer than usual. Cursing Robin Hood, the King orders Robin to be brought before him, and that anyone who brings him the head of Sir Richard would receive his lands. Then an old knight advises, as long as Robin Hood lives, no man will hold Sir Richard\\'s lands. Six months later, one of the King\\'s royal foresters approaches the King, suggesting a subterfuge to catch Robin. You and five men should dress as monks, he said, and I will lead you into the forest; then you will meet Robin Hood. The King wears a broad abbot\\'s hat to conceal his face, and goes into the forest. They soon meet Robin, standing in the road along with many of his men. Robin Hood grabs the reins of the King\\'s horse. Sir Abbot, Robin addresses the disguised King, we are but poor yeomen of the forest who live by the King\\'s deer, share with us some of your wealth as an act of charity. The disguised King replies he has only 40 pounds, having spent much during the last two weeks entertaining the King and his lords. If I had 100 pounds, he continues, I would give you half. Robin takes the 40 pounds, counts out 20 pounds, and returns 20 pounds to the disguised King. Our great king bids you come to Nottingham, says the disguised King, and shows Robin the royal seal. Robin immediately genuflects as he says,. \\t\"I love no man in all the world/. \\tSo well as I do my king;/. \\tWelcome is my lord\\'s seal;\":\\u200alines 1541-43\\u200a. In honour of the King, Robin invites the disguised King to dinner. Robin blows his horn to assemble the fellowship, who genuflect around him. The disguised King is surprised, realizing that Robin\\'s men are more willing to answer his call than the royal men are to answer the King\\'s call. Quickly the feast is prepared, with Robin and Little John waiting on the disguised King themselves. The disguised King is treated to fat venison, white bread, red wine, and ale.. After dinner, Robin arranges an archery demonstration. The disguised King remarks that the targets were too far away. Robin orders, anyone who misses the target would forfeit his arrows and endure a slap on his face from me. Twice Robin shoots, and twice he splits the wand. On the third attempt, Robin misses, and his men taunt him. Robin approaches the disguised King, offers his arrows, and says he is ready for his slap. The disguised King declines, saying it is against the rules of his order. Do it, declares Robin. The disguised King rolls up his sleeve and deals a resounding slap that knocks Robin to the ground. The disguised King bends over to help Robin up, and as he does so, Robin looks intently into the King\\'s face. Noticing Robin\\'s reaction, Sir Richard does the same. Then both of them genuflect to their King. Robin asks mercy for his men, which the King grants. The King then invites Robin to join Edward\\'s royal court. Only if I can bring my men with me, replies Robin.:\\u200alines 1413-1668 Eighth Fytte. In the first section, the King asks if Robin has any green cloth so he and his men can exchange their black cowls for ones of Lincoln green. Back to Nottingham, the King commands. With feasting, drinking, and singing, the King welcomes Robin and his men into his service, and restores Sir Richard\\'s lands.. Robin and his men spend the next year in the royal court. Robin has spent all his wealth, as well as the money meant for his men. Now only Little John and Scathelock remain. One day, while watching some young men at target practice, he becomes homesick. Robin asks the King for leave to make a pilgrimage to his chapel of Mary Magdalene in Barnsdale. The King grants him seven days.. When he reaches the greenwood with the birds merrily singing. He shoots a hart, and blows his horn. All the outlaws in the forest recognize Robin\\'s horn and come running. They push back their hoods and genuflect, welcoming Robin back. There he remains for twenty-two years.:\\u200alines 1669-1800\\u200aYears later, Robin has a kinswoman who was Prioress of Kirkley.  She and her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster, are plotting to kill Robin. Since the Prioress is skilled in the art of blood-letting, she lets Robin slowly bleed to death when he comes to Kirkley for treatment.:\\u200alines 1801-24\\u200a The tale ends with a prayer: \"Christ have mercy on his soul,/.../For he was a good outlaw,/And did poor men much good.\":\\u200alines 1821, 1823-4 Geography. The place names mentioned in Gest locate Robin Hood in the West Riding of Yorkshire: Blyth; Doncaster; St Mary Magdalene Church at Campsall; and Kirklees Abbey. The cities of York, Lancaster, and Nottingham, as well as the Knight\\'s castle at Wyresdale, are also mentioned.  This area is famous for its wide river valleys, and the eastern foothills of the South Pennines, with its numerous limestone caves where outlaws could hide.  The greenwood of Barnsdale Forest is Robin\\'s home; \"Robyn stood in Barnesdale/And leaned him to a tree,\":\\u200alines 9-10\\u200a is how the tale of the Sorrowful Knight opens. Earliest texts. A Gest of Robin Hode is considered as one of the three oldest Robin Hood tales. The other two are Robin Hood and the Monk (Child 119) and Robin Hood and the Potter (Child 121). Both of these latter tales survive as manuscripts dated to the second half of the 15th century; however, there are no surviving manuscripts of Gest. The earliest text fragments for Gest are from about a dozen printed editions dated to the 16th and 17th centuries.:\\u200a??\\u200a To identify the most important editions, Child labeled them as a through  g. Texts a through e are referred to as the early texts, and texts f and g are called the later texts. Of interest to linguists and historians is that the later texts replaced some of the obsolete words of the early texts in order to make Gest more understandable to the audiences of the time.:\\u200a40\\u200a:\\u200a39\\u200a  Since Child\\'s time, more editions have been identified by researchers.. John Maddicott has remarked on the lack of variation between the two earliest texts: text a and text b. He interpreted this lack of variation to a standard work being available prior to the printed editions. text a. also known as the Antwerp edition. Entitled A Gest of Robyn Hode; it has no printer\\'s name, location, or date.Also known as the Lettersnijder edition, it is attributed to Jan van Doesbroch in Antwerp c. 1510. Although it contains only about 200 of the total 456 quatrains, it is considered the most authentic version of the text, due to the linguistic archaisms in the text. It is housed at the National Library of Scotland.Text a is part of an eleven-text volume known as the Chapman and Myllar prints. However, only nine texts in the volume were actually printed by Chapman and Myllar. Text a was one of the two texts which were not. According to the National Library of Scotland, the volume was presented to the Advocates Library sometime before August 1788 by John Alston of Glasgow. The binding was not sturdy, being made of parchment, which explains why so many pages of text a are lost. (Text a being the last work in the volume.) Sometime between 1798 and 1808 the volume was rebound in London by Charles Hering.The page illustration shown at the top of this article shows the first page of text a. The  woodcut is almost identical to the Yeoman woodcut in Richard Pynson\\'s edition of The Canterbury Tales. However, the typesetter did not leave enough room for the woodcut, and had to reset the first 1-1/2 pages. The typesetter resorted to using abbreviations and run-on sentences to make everything fit.:\\u200a57 text b. also known as the de Worde edition, c. 1493-1518. Entitled A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode; it was printed by Wynken de Worde in London.This edition is nearly complete, and may be older than text a. It was used as the base text by Ritson and Gutch. Modern scholars, such as Child, Dobson and Taylor, Knight, and Ohlgren consider it to contain more errors, so they use text a and filled in from text b. It is housed at Cambridge University Library.The edition\\'s date is determined from the type fonts used, and the printer\\'s device on the last page.:\\u200a89 texts c through e (Douce Fragments). Individual pages which are in poor condition. They are housed at the Bodleian Library. text f (Copeland edition). Entitled A Mery Geste of Robyn Hoode. it was printed in London by William Copeland no earlier than 1548. It is housed at the British Museum. text g (White edition). Entitled A Merry Gest of Robin Hood. it was printed in London for Edward White, and is undated. It is housed at the Bodleian Library. Pynson\\'s edition (c. 1495–1500). Entitled A Lytell Geste. This edition survives as three sets of fragments::\\u200a45\\u200a. text c (Douce Fragment). single leaf fragment, now housed at Cambridge University Library. two leaves now housed at the Folger Shakespeare Library Hugo Goes edition. Entitled A Lytell Geste and printed in York sometime prior to 1509. The only surviving leaf is one of the Douce Fragments (e.12). Hugo Goes worked with one of de Worde\\'s assistants, Henry Watson.  When de Worde moved his business to Fleet Street after 1500, Goes acquired some of his fonts before moving to York to start his own business.:\\u200a157-8 Julian Notary edition (c. 1515). Entitled A Lytell Geste. The surviving fragments are four imperfect leaves attached to paper binding strips (Douce fragment f.1).  The attribution to Notary is confirmed by the size and style of the type fonts; he was the only London printer to use 92 mm.:\\u200a149-50 Copeland edition (c. 1565). A single leaf fragment of waste print used as spine support for a volume printed in London by John Wolfe in 1584.. It is attributed to Copeland based upon the type font. The date is estimated from the language differences from his 1560 edition.:\\u200a239-40\\u200a It is housed at the Codrington Library, All Souls College, Oxford. White edition (copy of the Bodleian Library edition). Entitled A Merry Iest of Robin Hood, and printed in London for Edward White, bookseller, c. 1594. The printer is thought to have been Edward Allde. Anthony Munday, author of the Robin Hood plays, was apprenticed to Allde. The text is closely based upon William Copeland\\'s edition, however, the spelling was updated and punctuation was introduced.:\\u200a245–7\\u200a It is housed at the Chaplin Library, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts. Literary analysis. Gest was studied by William Hall Clawson in 1909. Clawson was a student of F. J. Child\\'s successor, George Lyman Kittredge, and his dissertation on Gest expanded on Child\\'s introduction.  In 1968, medievalist D. C. Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad. Fowler was one of the first to advocate the study of the English and Scottish ballads relative to their historical time and place, rather than simply within the classification of the Child anthology.:\\u200a3,4\\u200a In 1974, J. B. Bessinger Jr attempted to extend Clawson and incorporate Fowler\\'s proposal that Gest was a product of 15th-century minstrels.:\\u200a43\\u200a One of Bessinger\\'s contributions was a narrative schematic that refined Child\\'s \"3-ply web\" into three tales of nine episodes distributed among eight fyttes.In 1984, Douglas Gray, the first J. R. R. Tolkien Professor of English Literature and Language at the University of Oxford, considered the Robin Hood and Scottish Border ballads more as oral poems. He objected to the then-current definitions of a ballad as some ideal form, whose characteristics were distilled from the Child Ballads. When compared to \"this notion of a \\'pure ballad\\', the Robin Hood poems seem messy and anormalous\", he contended.:\\u200a9\\u200a Therefore, he titled his article The Robin Hood Poems, and not The Robin Hood Ballads.. However, Gray admitted that the Robin Hood tales, like most popular literature, are sometimes regarded as \"sub-literary material\", containing formulaic language and a \"thin texture\", especially \"when they are read on the printed page\".:\\u200a4\\u200a Additionally, he argued, that since Child had grouped all the Robin Hood \\'ballads\\' together, some literary studies had \"rashly based themselves on all the Robin Hood ballads in the collection\":\\u200a9\\u200a, instead of discarding those of dubious value. J. R. Maddicott also recognized this issue, and argued that since so little is known about the origins of the ballads from the available early manuscripts and printed texts, internal evidence has to be used.) Gray further contended that, as oral poetry, each poem should be judged as a performance. He agreed with Ruth Finnegan in considering the performance as \"integral to the identity of the poem as actually realized\".:\\u200a10\\u200a In an oral performance, a skillful raconteur can draw his audience in, making them part of his performance; hence no two oral performances are identical.:\\u200a10\\u200a Gray points out that one of the characteristics of Gest are scenes with rapid dialogue or conversations, in which the formulaic diction, limited vocabulary, and stereotyped expressions are artfully used to express emotion.:\\u200a25\\u200a Such scenes lying dully on a page can spring into action when recited by one or two talented minstrels. The Gest poet. Gest is a compilation of many early Robin Hood tales, either in verse or prose, but most of them now lost.:\\u200a25\\u200a:\\u200a431\\u200a:\\u200a??\\u200a They were woven together into a single narrative poem by an unknown poet.  F. C. Child, arguing that there was only one poet, described the Gest poet as \"a thoroughly congenial spirit.\":\\u200a49\\u200a W. H. Clawson considered him \"to have been exceedingly skillful\",:\\u200a24\\u200a while J. B. Bessinger declared him as \"original and transitional\"[p 43]. Gray thought the weaving to have \"been neatly done\".:\\u200a23\\u200a J. C. Holt implied that there were two poets: the original poet who compiled the First, Second, and Fourth Fyttes as a single poem; and another less skilled poet who compiled the Third and Fifth Fyttes into the work produced by the original poet.:\\u200a22-25\\u200a Others, such as J. R. Maddicott,, have considered him as less than adequate. They point to a narrative that is not sequential (it jumps back and forth between the tales); the transitions between tales are not smooth; there are inconsistencies within each tale, and between the tales.  Child was one of the first to recognize that Gest contains ballads from two different traditions: the Barnsdale tradition (found in the First, Second, and Fourth Fyttes), and the Nottingham tradition (found in the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Fyttes).:\\u200a51\\u200a Clawson then attempted to identify the source ballads.:\\u200a125-7\\u200a J. C. Holt considers Clawson work as fundamental to a careful study of Gest, and admits there is no consensus on how many underlying tales were used, or which lines can be considered the work of the Gest poet. In contrast to Clawson, who struggled mightily to connect Gest with existing outlaw ballads, Holt\\'s study indicated that none of the sources have survived, that the tales were not necessarily in verse form, and that the source tales come from several traditions.:\\u200a36\\u200a Why the Gest poet used these particular tales to construct this epic-length poem is unknown. First Fytte. The First Fytte begins with a now-lost light-hearted tale about Robin Hood and a poor knight.:\\u200alines 65–244\\u200a:\\u200a24, 125\\u200a The original tale was obviously part of a Barnsdale tradition of Robin Hood, based upon the numerous references to local landmarks. When the Knight is accosted in Barnsdale, he mentions that he planned to spend the night in either Blyth or Doncaster.:\\u200aline 108\\u200aThe remainder of the First Fytte:\\u200alines 245–324\\u200a:\\u200a125\\u200a is based on a \\'Miracle of the Virgin Mary\\' story. The \\'Miracle\\' was a moral story often told during religious services, and these stories were very popular. They generally concerned the Virgin Mary (or any of the Saints) being invoked as surety for a loan. The most common ending of a Miracle described an actual miracle to repay the loan. There was also a humorous ending where the repayment money is taken from a person in a religious order who in some way represented the Virgin or Saint. In this ending, this person is regarded as the messenger sent by the Virgin or Saint to repay the debt.:\\u200a25–38\\u200a The First Fytte ends with Robin Hood and his men outfitting the poor knight in a manner befitting a messenger of the Virgin Mary.:\\u200alines 303–4\\u200a. Second Fytte. This Fytte has a darker tone. The first part of the Second Fytte appears to be based on another now-lost tale, where a knight repays his debt to an Abbot with money received from Robin Hood. Parts of the original tale remain, even though they do not fit with the end of the First Fytte. In the original tale, the Knight is away on an overseas military campaign,:\\u200alines 353–6\\u200a but unexpectedly re-appears.:\\u200alines 383–4\\u200a He orders his men to put on their ragged travelling clothes before approaching the abbey.:\\u200alines 385–8\\u200a His men and the horses are led to the stables, as the Knight, also in ragged clothes, enters the great hall.:\\u200alines 390–404\\u200a  Little John is never mentioned, nor is the Abbey named. Near the end of the Fytte, the Knight resumes his good clothing, leaving his ragged clothes at the abbey.:\\u200alines 499–500\\u200a:\\u200a42–5\\u200a. The rest of this Fytte appears to be fragments of other tales, perhaps compiled by the Gest poet. The light-hearted fragment describing how the Knight prepares to repay Robin Hood:\\u200alines 501–536\\u200a has an internal consistency, and is reminiscent of the opening lines of the First Fytte. The fair at Wentbridge:\\u200alines 537–568\\u200a may have been taken from another tale:\\u200a47\\u200a to be used as a plot device to delay the Knight, thus preparing for the tale of Robin Hood and the Monk in the Fourth Fytte.. Third Fytte. This episode probably consists of three or four now-lost tales. The light-hearted opening scene at the archery shoot:\\u200alines 577–600\\u200a could have been borrowed from any of the then-popular tales. After which the Gest poet inserted two quatrains which refer to Little John\\'s courteous master from whom the Sheriff must secure permission.:\\u200alines 601–608\\u200a The second now-lost tale:\\u200alines 613–760\\u200a is definitely low comedy. The audience is told that Little John is seeking vengeance on the Sheriff for some unspecified action.:\\u200alines 613–616\\u200a When Little John is denied breakfast because he slept in, the subsequent action of \"exuberant rough-house\" \"turns into a scene of total destruction\",:\\u200a28\\u200a as Little John picks a fight with the butler. The tale then assumes \"an air of carnival \\'justice\\'\",:\\u200a28\\u200a when he breaks into the pantry to eat and drink his fill.. However, the third tale:\\u200alines 761–796\\u200a has a somber tone, as Little John lures the Sheriff into an ambush. Instead of killing them all, Robin makes the Sheriff and his men endure a night on the cold wet ground, wearing nothing but a green mantle.. The last few lines of the Fytte:\\u200alines 797–816\\u200a were probably written by the Gest poet. The Sheriff\\'s complains that he would rather have Robin \"smite off mine head\":\\u200aline 799\\u200a than spend another night in the greenwood. Robin then demands the Sheriff swear an oath on Robin\\'s sword not to harm Robin or his men.:\\u200alines 805–806, 813\\u200a This little scene is a foreshadow of the scene in the Sixth Fytte, where Robin Hood uses his sword to decapitate the Sheriff as punishment for breaking his oath.:\\u200alines 1389–1396\\u200a. Fourth Fytte. The Second Fytte ended with the Knight being delayed at the fair at Wentbridge. The Fourth Fytte opens with Robin Hood worrying about the Knight\\'s late arrival.:\\u200alines 821–828\\u200a It\\'s not about the money; he is fretting about why the Virgin Mary is upset with him. This is the Gest poet\\'s introduction to yet another now-lost tale about Robin and the Monk.:\\u200alines 829–1040\\u200a This tale is also the ending of the Miracle story, as Little John recognizes that the Monk carries the debt repayment which was ensured by the Virgin Mary.At the beginning of the Monk tale, there is another inconsistency. When first spotted by Little John, there were two monks.:\\u200aline 851\\u200a Later, at the feast, there is only one monk mentioned.:\\u200alines 897–1040\\u200a. The last part of the Fytte:\\u200alines 1041–1120\\u200a is the ending of Tale A. This reunion and reconciliation of Robin and the Knight was most probably original material written by the Gest poet.. Fifth Fytte. The original now-lost tale probably consisted of the archery match, the subsequent attack by the Sheriff\\'s men, the wounding of Little John, and the flight into the greenwood.(lines ) No parallels have been found among the extant contemporary tales. The remainder of the Fytte was composed by the Gest poet.:\\u200a80–3\\u200a. Sixth Fytte. The original now-lost tale probably consisted of the sheriff capturing a gentle knight, taking him to Nottingham, the knight\\'s wife begging Robin to save her husband, the subsequent skirmish, and the rescued knight becoming a fugitive in Robin\\'s group.:\\u200alines 1321–1408\\u200a Once again, there are no parallels to be found among the extant contemporary tales. The remainder of the Fytte was composed by the Gest poet.:\\u200a84-91\\u200a. Seventh Fytte. Separately from the Robin Hood ballads, Child discussed the \"King and Subject\" ballad tradition, in which the King (in disguise) meets with one of his Subjects.[Child, V, pt 1] He mentions in passing that the Seventh and Eighth Fyttes of Gest contains such a tale.[p. 69] Both Child and Clawson dismiss The King\\'s Disguise, and Friendship with Robin Hood (Child 151), (the only extant Robin Hood ballad involving the king) as being an 18th century paraphrase of Gest. Curiously, both also discuss two tales, King Edward and the Shepherd[Rochester] and The King and the Hermit,[Rochester] as being very similar to the original ballad underlying the Seventh Fytte, but never make the connection.:\\u200a106–7,\\u200a127\\u200a Clawson simply remarks that \"tales like this are common and popular the world over\".:\\u200a103\\u200a However, Thomas Ohlgren considers the parallels between the two tales as part of the evidence supporting his assertion that \"our comely king\" in Gest was Edward III.:\\u200a9–12\\u200a (See Historical Analysis). Eighth Fytte. Both Child and Clawson are silent on possible sources for this fytte. Character descriptions. Most of the main characters are described in 52 lines at the beginning of the poem.:\\u200alines 1–20, 29–60\\u200a Thus the Gest poet immediately draws attention to the purpose of his work. Gest\\'s scenes are constructed to show the difference in the behavior of good and wicked characters. Goodness (referred to as \"Courtesy\") is displayed as ethical or moral qualities, such as kindness, generosity, truthfulness, and personal loyalty. \"Courtesy\" (the word occurs 17 times in Gest) is the opposite of injustice.:\\u200a30\\u200a. Robin Hood. good yeomanSee Historical Analysis section for a fuller description of yeoman as used in Gest.. proud outlawThis is the only time \\'proud\\' is applied to Robin Hood; but it is applied to the Sheriff of Nottingham 20 times throughout the Gest. The word is being used in two different senses. When applied to the Sheriff, proud means \\'haughty, arrogant\\'. When applied to Robin, proud means \\'brave, bold, valiant\\', or \\'noble in bearing or appearance\\'.. courteous outlawIn Middle English, courtesy meant \\'refined, well-mannered, polite\\' and \\'gracious, benevolent, generous, merciful\\'. Robin repeatedly exhibits all these traits.. devoutRobin hears three masses a day, and has a special devotion to the Virgin Mary. The latter is a strong motivator for him in Tale A.. leadershipRobin is able to impose a code of conduct upon his fellow outlaws. He insists that they can do \"well enough\":\\u200aline 50\\u200a by not waylaying farmers, yeomen, or any knight or squire who is a \"good fellow\".:\\u200aline 55\\u200a He singles out bishops and archbishops for beatings. Robin has a particularly strong hostility for the Sheriff of Nottingham.. Little John. He defers to Robin by calling him \"Master\",:\\u200alines 19, 41\\u200a and serves as Robin\\'s right-hand man. But he is not reluctant in letting Robin know how he feels about following his orders. He agrees to follow Robin\\'s code of conduct for the fellowship, but shows his concern (or irritation) when Robin insists on finding a stranger for dinner so late in the day.. Much, the miller\\'s son. Apparently of short stature, Much is praised as every \"inch of his body ... worth a man\".:\\u200alines 15–16\\u200a Much saves a wounded Little John by carrying him on his back.The remaining characters are described when they appear in the tale. Each character is described by one or more of their ethical or moral qualities. There are only three characters who are given a physical description. The Sorrowful Knight. The Gest poet spends eight lines describing his physical appearance.:\\u200alines 85–92\\u200a Little John, a good judge of people, calls him \"gentle\", \"courteous\", and \"noble\".:\\u200alines 95, 98\\u200a These qualities the Knight demonstrates repeatedly in Tales A and B.. The Greedy Abbot and the Kind-hearted Prior. The qualities of these two characters are revealed during their conversation at dinner, while awaiting the arrival of the Knight.:\\u200alines 341–362\\u200a The Abbot compounds his wickedness with a lie by calling the Knight \"false\".:\\u200aline 455\\u200a. The Chief Steward. He is introduced as \"a fat-headed monk\",:\\u200alines 363–4\\u200a emphasizing the fat cheeks and neck under his monk\\'s tonsure. Little John calls him \"a churl monk\";:\\u200aline 873\\u200a insulting the monk twice with a single word. In Middle English it meant a person lacking in courtesy, or a person of low birth.. Sheriff of Nottingham. He is the stereotypical wicked villain with no redeeming qualities. He lies when he tells the King that the Knight is a traitor,:\\u200alines 1293–1296\\u200a but later becomes a traitor himself by breaking his oath to Robin.:\\u200alines 1391–1396\\u200a. King Edward Linguistic analysis. Francis James Child was the first to look at Gest from a linguistic perspective. While compiling The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, he was in frequent contact with language scholars in England who were collecting quotations from Middle English texts for what would become the first volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary. These scholars, including Walter William Skeat, the leading philologist in England, would later publish A Concise Dictionary of Middle English, and An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. It was Skeat who provided Child with transcriptions of the texts that appeared in Child\\'s anthology. Skeat also was one of the first philologists to discuss English language dialects in English Dialects from the Eighth Century to the Present Day published in 1911.In his introduction to Gest, Child tried to argue that the references to Robin Hood in Piers Plowman and the Scottish chronicles indicated a date of composition for Gest as early as 1400, or even earlier. However, he was forced to conclude that \"There are no firm grounds on which to base an opinion.\":\\u200a40\\u200a Child asserted that there were \"A considerable number of Middle-English forms\" present; he even constructed a partial listing of the words ending in \\'-e\\'. William Hall Clawson, a doctoral student under Child\\'s successor, George Lyman Kittredge, expanded Child\\'s word list, and even calculated the final totals of how many times such words were used in each Fytte. Thus Clawson attempted to \"prove clearly that it [Gest] extends back to a period ... antedating the year 1400.\":\\u200a4–6\\u200aA modern linguistic analysis of Gest was performed by Masa Ikegami in 1985. He constructed multiple lines of linguistic evidence that Gest was written in a Northern or East Midlands dialect, most probably during the mid- to late-15th century. His evidence is based upon Gest\\'s quatrain structure, its ABCB or ABAB rhyme scheme, and its meter (rhythm pattern). The Gest meter can be summarized as: the first and third lines have four metrically stressed syllables. the second and fourth lines have three metrically stressed syllables. each stressed syllable is preceded by one or two unstressed syllablesThis meter is illustrated in the following quatrain, which should be read aloud in order to hear the rhythm of the stressed syllables (in bold font): Irregular lines do occur, but they are limited, and only occur in the three-beat lines.:\\u200a272–3 Evidence of date of composition. Presence of silent final \\'-e\\'. Modern linguists no longer accept the presence of final \\'-e\\' (now known as schwa) as evidence for composition prior to 1400. Ikegami provides a summary of other works known to have been composed in the 15th which contain the silent final \\'-e\\'.:\\u200a271\\u200aThe silent final \\'-e\\' does not have to be pronounced in Gest in order to support the meter (rhythm pattern). Ikegami uses the example of \\'grene wode\\', which Modern English speakers pronounce as two syllables: \\'green wood\\'. In Chaucer\\'s time, the phrase would have been pronounced as four syllables: \\'gre-ne wo-de\\', where the schwa was pronounced as the \\'a\\' in sofa or the \\'u\\' in lucky. The phrase \\'grene wode\\' occurs thirteen times in Gest, and the silent final \\'-e\\' never needs to be pronounced in order to \"keep the beat\".:\\u200a271–2 Presence of new phraseology. As a replacement for the now-silent \\'-e\\', Ikegami points out that the Gest poet introduces a new phrase construct: adjective + adjective|noun + noun. Some examples (with the stressed syllables in bold font and in modern spelling) are: Ikegami remarks that no works prior to 1400 have this phrasing.:\\u200a273-4\\u200a Rather, Gest\\'s use of this phrasing is similar to that of The Floure and the Leafe, which is considered to have composed during the third quarter of the 15th century (c.\\u20091450–1475).:\\u200a279 Frequent use of \\'long e\\' rhyme. The Gest poet uses several rhymes that only work if the modern \\'long e\\' sound is used. Some examples, with only the rhyming words shown, follow: The modern \\'long e\\' sound is considered to be one of the earliest changes associated with the Great Vowel Shift which began c. 1400.:\\u200a275-6 Rhyming \\'all\\' with \\'tale\\'. This rhyme:\\u200alines 1422, 1424\\u200a only works after c. 1400. It is also associated with the great vowel shift.:\\u200a275 Evidence of Northern or East Midland dialect. The linguistic research begun by Skeat and his colleagues (as published in their various Middle English dictionaries) has been continued by modern linguists. Between 1898 and 1905, Joseph Wright published the seminal English Dialect Dictionary, based upon data collected by the English Dialect Society. The famous Survey of English Dialects was undertaken between 1950 and 1961. Therefore, linguists have as detailed an understanding of the various Middle English dialects as the surviving literature and native speakers allow. . The evidence for a Northern or East Midland dialect within the very words of Gest relies on the observation that, prior to standardization of English language spelling, Middle English authors spelled words as they were pronounced (that is, phonetically). Thus the rhyme words in each quatrain are also very valuable in determining whether or not regional dialects can be identified in Gest.  Some of Ikegami\\'s findings are below.:\\u200a276-8\\u200a. Northern pronunciation. The Northern England dialect of Middle English (ME) results from a mixture of the Anglian dialects of Old English (OE) and the Old Norse (ON) of the Danelaw, with an overlay of Norman French.. The OE/ON vowel ā (long a) appears as ME /a:/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'a\\' in father) in the rhyme pair hame:dame:\\u200alines 594,596\\u200a. The non-Northern vowel /ɔ:/ (pronounced roughly like \\'aw\\' in law) appears in the rhyme pair more:before:\\u200alines 986,988\\u200a.. The OE/ON diphthong āg (equivalent to \\'w\\') appears as ME /au/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'ou\\' in house) in the rhyme pair lowe:shawe:\\u200alines 1134,1136\\u200a. The non-Northern ME diphthong /ɔu/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'o\\' in bone) appears in the rhyme pair lowe:inowe:\\u200alines 170,172\\u200a.Northern and Eastern Midlands pronunciation. The Eastern Midlands dialect of ME results from a mixture of the OE Mercian dialect and the ON of the Danelaw, with an overlay of Norman French.. There are two sequences of long vowel pronunciation changes which are characteristic of Northern and Eastern Midland dialects. The OE long vowel ǣ (pronounced roughly like the \\'a\\' in mat) was raised to the ME long open vowel /ɛ:/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'a\\' in hay), and raised again to ME close /e/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'e\\' in bet). Similarly, the OE long vowel ā was also raised to ME long open vowel /ɛ:/, and then raised again to ME close /o:/ (pronounced roughly like the \\'oa\\' in boat). These changes appear in the rhyme pairs: see:the:\\u200alines 222,224\\u200a; mone:none:\\u200alines 254,256\\u200a; do:theretoo:\\u200alines 686,688\\u200a; ere:chere:\\u200alines 954,956\\u200a.. Additional vowel pronunciations which are typical of the North and the East Midlands include OE short y appearing as /i/, pronounced roughly like the \\'i\\' in bit (rhyme pair synne:in:\\u200alines 38,40\\u200a; and OE or ON long ȳ appearing as /i:/, pronounced roughly like the \\'ee\\' in see (rhyme pair pryde:beside:\\u200alines 86,88\\u200a. Historical analysis. Maurice Keen wrote The Outlaws of Medieval Legend in 1961, which compared the historical background of the Robin Hood ballads with other legendary and historical outlaw figures. Over the next four decades, various historians contributed to the debate on which historical periods are depicted in the Robin Hood ballads.  In 1968, D C Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad as a modern update to Child\\'s Ballads. He focused on the historical background of Gest and the earliest Robin Hood tales. Many of the Child Robin Hood ballads were composed later, some as late as the 17th century, and are not relevant to explorations of the 14th–16th century versions of the Robin Hood legend.. The linguistic analysis suggests that Gest was probably compiled c. 1450–1475. The literary analysis suggests that the component tales were written down prior to 1450 from earlier oral forms which no longer exist.  Various linkages can be made between historical events and evidence from the 14th and 15th centuries and the society portrayed within the internal bounds of Gest, such as Robin\\'s yeoman status as compared to other yeomen in the tales; which King Edward is referred to; references to changing feudal practices and the abuses of Late Medieval England; and the probable early audiences. Political and military events. In 2013, Joseph Taylor, aware of Ikegami\\'s linguistic analysis, examined Gest as a northern text in the historical regional context of northern England.:\\u200a313\\u200a Northeast England has a history of political, cultural, and military separateness from southern England since the Heptarchy, when it was the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was later invaded and settled by the Vikings as the Kingdom of Jorvik. After the Norman Conquest, the Earl of Northumbria and the prince-bishops of the County Palatine of Durham were given political and military power second only to the King in London. The strategic geographic location of the northern counties was formally recognized in 1249 under a treaty which established the Scottish Marches as a buffer zone between Scotland and England. Each of the six Marches (three English and three Scottish) were controlled by their own Wardens. Many of the English East Wardens were appointed from powerful regional families, such as the Percies, the Nevilles, and the Cliffords. The border conflicts meant money and power to these regional families. As \"kings in the North\",:\\u200a316\\u200a they maintained private armies to control, as well as defend, England\\'s border. The intermittent wars with Scotland also provided political leverage with the King in London, who fully realized that only the northern magnates could mobilize the necessary troops against Scotland — or against London.:\\u200a316–7\\u200aThis sense of separateness is reflected in the Gest in the way London is portrayed as the power base for the villainous Abbot of St Mary\\'s and Sheriff of Nottingham (see here).. Parliament\\'s rise in importance during the 14th century also provided the Northern magnates with a legitimate means to restrict royal power within their counties.:\\u200a316–7 Social changes. the Hundred Years\\' War which was actually three phases of war separated by truces. ongoing clashes between the York and Lancaster dynasties over the throne of England; which attached the Duchy of Lancaster to the Crown under Henry IV, and the Duchy of York to the Crown under Edward IV. Following the Wars of the Roses, political power was finally consolidated under Henry VII.:\\u200a314\\u200a. social changes caused by the breakup of the English feudal systemOne important social change which occurred in response to the changes brought about by the climate, diseases, and military upheavals is the gradual change in the meaning of the term yeoman, which is used repeatedly in Gest. During the 14th and 15th centuries, between the time when the component tales were still in oral form and the time when Gest was compiled, the meaning of \"yeoman\" changed substantially.:\\u200a52-3\\u200a Originally, \"yeoman\" was a rank of noble household service as well as the chivalric rank between page and squire. By the late 14th century, it was also used to refer to freeborn and free tenure smallholders. During the 15th century, it began to refer to the growing social category (referred to as a \"middling sort\":\\u200a55\\u200a), consisting of the now land-wealthy commoner landowners and the land-poor younger sons of nobility. (Primogeniture dictated that only the eldest son could inherit the family estates.) This self-identification was re-inforced by the 1413 Statute of Additions under Henry V, in which those paying the polltax had to specify their status and occupation. Eventually, \"yeoman\" expanded to include husbandmen who practiced a trade or craft to supplement their farming income.:\\u200a52-3\\u200a These shifts in meaning are evident in Gest when the component tales are considered separately from the narrative arc (see here). Yeoman in Gest. Richard Almond and A. J. Pollard did a study of the earliest Robin Hood tales, including Gest, Robin Hood and the Monk, Robin Hood and the Potter, and Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.  To address this spectrum of possible meanings of \\'yeoman\\' over the centuries, they proposed that, within Gest, the \\'yeoman\\' Robin Hood has to be studied (1) separately from the minor characters called \"yeoman\", and (2) separately from the \\'yeoman\\' of the audience.:\\u200a56\\u200a They referred to this confusion in the various meanings of \\'yeoman\\' as the \"slipperiness of social terminology\" in the 15th century.:\\u200a75\\u200a  Their main source, Peter Coss, also considered another confusion factor, that Gest was compiled from multiple source tales.:\\u200a71\\u200a  Some historical clues found within Gest and the possible source tales, and the changing meanings of \\'yeoman\\', are below. Robin as yeoman of the forest?. Almond and Pollard credited J. C. Holt with being the first historian to recognize the connection between a yeoman and the forest.:\\u200a57\\u200a Based upon clues within the text, Almond and Pollard extended Holt\\'s idea, and proposed that audiences of the 15th century would have recognized Robin Hood as being a forester of Barnsdale or Sherwood because of these clues::\\u200a56-8\\u200a. use of the phrase \\'yeoman of the forest\\'. The phrase appears in the Fourth Fytte:\\u200alines 881-884\\u200a, and again in the Seventh Fytte:\\u200alines 1505-1508\\u200a. The former scene is when the Chief Steward insults Robin Hood by calling him a thief, to which Little John retorts that Robin is a \\'yeoman of the forest\\'. The latter scene is when Robin Hood stops the disguised king, and introduces himself and his men as \\'yeomen of the forest\\', now forced to dine on the King\\'s deer. Almond and Pollard propose that the importance which appears to be attached to the phrase in these scenes indicate that Robin and his fellowship are more than mere outlaws taking refuge in the greenwood.:\\u200a58-9\\u200aRobin \\'walking\\' in the forest. In the Sixth Fytte:\\u200alines 1313-1316\\u200a, Robin is described as walking in the forest, much to the chagrin of the Sheriff. Almond and Pollard suggest that \"walking\" should be interpreted in the sense of walking associated with an occupation, such as a \"police officer walking his beat\" meaning a police officer patroling his assigned area.:\\u200a60\\u200a This interpretation is supported by :\\u200a19-20\\u200a who described the foresters as sworn to protect the \"vert and venison\" within their assigned areas, which were known as divisions, wards, bailiwicks, or walks.. This phrase occurs after Robin and his men leave Sir Richard\\'s castle, and before the Sheriff captures Sir Richard. It may be a part of a transition between fragments of two separate tales.. other \\'good yeomen\\' who \\'walk\\'. In the First Fytte, Robin forbids his men to waylay \"good yeoman/That walketh by green wood shawe [thicket]\".:\\u200alines 53-54\\u200a Almond and Pollard suggest that here Robin is referring to the other forest officials who were also yeomen: verderer, woodward, ranger, or agister.:\\u200a60\\u200aonly a \\'proud forester\\' can catch Robin. In the Seventh Fytte:\\u200alines 1465-1480\\u200a only a \"proud forester\" in royal service knows how to track Robin down. And that was by disguising the King as an abbot and five of his bodyguards as monks; in other words, it takes a forester to catch a forester.:\\u200a61\\u200a It is unknown if this opening fragment is from a now-lost tale or part of the Gest poet\\'s transition between the Sixth and Seventh Fyttes. Robin\\'s knowledge of royal hunt rituals. Almond and Pollard have traced some of the hunting rituals and terminology found in Gest back to The Master of Game, a hunting book translated in 1413 from French by Edward, Duke of York.:\\u200a64-66\\u200a They point out that in all the English-language 15th-century hunting literature, \\'yeoman\\' is used consistently to refer to the hunt and forest officials.:\\u200a65\\u200a\"Bow and stable\" was the hunting technique in which herds of deer are driven by foresters and professional huntsmen towards the stationary noble hunters. The tryst tree is where the noble huntsman stood, with his bowbearer and his hound handlers, to await the deer being flushed toward them. Sometimes a lodge or hut made of green boughs would be built at the tryst for shelter as well as camouflage.:\\u200a64-66\\u200a. Almond and Pollard compare the \\'royal\\' dinner prepared by Robin for the disguised King in the Seventh Fytte:\\u200alines 1545-1576\\u200a to that described in The Master of Game. Believing the abbot to be the King\\'s emissary since he carries the Privy Seal, Robin invites him to a royal hunt. Robin escorts his honored guest by the hand (as is required of the yeoman of the bow) to the tryst tree. There the deer are slain and ritually butchered (dyghtande is a northern England term for the ritual).:\\u200alines 1533-1576\\u200a The butchering is done by Robin himself for the disguised King, who was given the prime cuts of venison, along with bread and wine.:\\u200a66-9\\u200aIn Gest, the huntsman\\'s hut serves as the tryst tree for the dinners with the Knight in the First Fytte and the Chief Steward of St Mary\\'s in the Fourth Fytte. The Knight is given swan and pheasant, a noble\\'s repast, but also the numbles, which was traditionally reserved for the foresters and the huntsmen.:\\u200a68-9\\u200aThis royal (or noble) hunt familiarity may indicate that the Gest poet was a member of either a royal or noble household. Or it may indicate that hunting tales were part of his repertoire. Or both. Coss proposes that the Gest poet had a fairly large body of source material from which to choose. And since he chose to weave his sources together, rather than lay them end-to-end, it is difficult to untangle the now-lost tales which he used.:\\u200a71-2 Comparison with Chaucer\\'s yeoman. Almond and Pollard also credited J. C. Holt as the first historian to notice the resemblance between Robin Hood and Geoffrey Chaucer\\'s The Knight\\'s Yeoman in The Canterbury Tales.:\\u200a62-3\\u200a But Holt never realized the significance of the Yeoman\\'s accoutrements: his green coat and hood, his bow and arrows; his buckler and sword; and his horn attached to a green baldric. All of which indicated the Yeoman was a forester and huntsman; a position with which Chaucer was certainly familiar. He served as forester of North Petherton Park in Somersetshire for the last decade of his life.:\\u200axl\\u200aThe green livery of the forester and huntsman is depicted in many of the miniatures of the Livre de chasse, written by Gaston III, Count of Foix, in the late 14th century.:\\u200a63 Minor yeoman characters. Much, the Miller\\'s son, and Will Scarlock, are both described as yeomen in the First Fytte, as they stand on the Saylis looking for Robin\\'s guest.:\\u200aline 78\\u200a When combined with Robin\\'s description of his men as \\'yeomen of the forest\\' in the Seventh Fytte, the implication is that they are both foresters.(See above.). In the Second Fytte, the young men participating in the wrestling match are described as yeomen.:\\u200alines 539-540\\u200a But since no details are given, the exact meaning is uncertain.:\\u200a74\\u200a. In the Third Fytte, Robin welcomes Little John back to the greenwood, and refers to the Sheriff\\'s cook as a \"fair yeoman\".:\\u200aline 709\\u200a Robin probably recognized the cook\\'s clothing as being from the Sheriff\\'s household. \\'Yeoman\\' was a service rank in the household kitchen.:\\u200a74\\u200a. In the Eighth Fytte, the townspeople of Nottingham are called \"both yeomen and knaves\".:\\u200aline 1714\\u200a Here \\'yeomen\\' refers to the tradesmen,:\\u200a74\\u200a and knaves refers to the common laborers.:\\u200asense 3\\u200a. In the First Fytte, Little John is introduced as a \"good yeoman\" standing next to Robin.:\\u200aline 12\\u200a Throughout Gest, Little John refers to Robin as his master.:\\u200alines 19, 41, 99, 101-2, 277, 281, 297, 705, 825, 881-2\\u200a He also demonstrates a courtesy equal to that of Robin\\'s in his interactions with the Sorrowful Knight:\\u200alines 93-4\\u200a and the disguised King.:\\u200aline 1568\\u200a  Robin later offers Little John\\'s service to the Sorrowful Knight as knave, who can serve as a yeoman in time of need.:\\u200alines 322-323\\u200a Here the meaning of \\'knave\\' is an attendant,:\\u200asense 2\\u200a and \\'yeoman\\' refers to the military (chivalric) rank.:\\u200asense 1\\u200a Later on, in the Third Fytte, Little John, in the guise of Reynold Greenleaf the knave, infiltrates the Sheriff\\'s household in order to wreak vengeance on the Sheriff.:\\u200alines 611-16 Which King Edward?. Almond and Pollard\\'s approach coincides neatly with the results of Thomas Ohlgren\\'s study of \\'which\\' King Edward is meant in Gest. Ohlgren asserts that the individual tales were composed during the early decades of the reign of Edward III (r 1327–1377). He bases his assertion on internal evidence (references made in the text) concerning feudalism, livery and maintenance, and other details that can be traced back to Edward III\\'s reign.:\\u200a2\\u200a Ohlgren proposes that Gest was compiled from these individual tales during the reign of Henry V (1413–1422) or Henry VI (first reign 1422–1461).:\\u200a2\\u200a He uses the example of the 14th-century political poems of Lauence Minot, whose poems were recopied during Henry V\\'s reign to celebrate Henry\\'s victories in France. Similarly, some of the Robin Hood tales which referred to Edward III could have been compiled as Gest. Ohlgren argues that cultural references made in the original tales would only be understood by an audience who was no more than two or three generations later than Edward III.:\\u200a26-8\\u200a To support his assertion, Ohlgren considers clues which can be found within the text of Gest. \"Edward our comely King\":\\u200aline 1412\\u200a. The king is referred to as \"Edward, our comely king\". But which King Edward is it? The epithet is the first clue. Olhgren recently discovered a similar epithet in the political poetry written by Laurence Minot in the 14th century. Minot composed poems in Middle English celebrating the victories of Edward III, including those against the Scots (Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333) and against the French (Siege of Guînes (1352)). They were probably written not long after the events, but eleven of his political poems were revised c. 1352 to form a continuous narrative. They were popular enough to have been recopied during the reign of Henry V or Henry VI (our earliest surviving text is dated to 1425-50).:\\u200a?\\u200a Minot\\'s poem IV begins: Ohlgren considered this significant, as only two works are known to use the phrase \"Edward our comely king\": Minot\\'s poem IV and Gest. By itself, this evidence is not convincing; but the other three clues, which are inter-related, add weight to his argument.. \"far beyond the sea/In England right\":\\u200alines 353-54\\u200a. In the Second Fytte, the greedy Abbot is gloating that this is the Knight\\'s last day to repay his debt, then his lands will be forfeit. The kind-hearted Prior rebukes the Abbot: \"Far beyond the sea\" has been usually interpreted as the Knight being on crusade or a pilgrimage:\\u200a192-93\\u200a, but Ohlgren considers it to mean that the Knight was fighting in France at the beginning of the Hundred Years War. \"In England right\" was the rallying cry for Edward III\\'s legal claim to certain territories in France - and to the French throne. The phrase appears 4 times in Minot\\'s poems, and it always refers to Edward\\'s legal claim.:\\u200a8-9\\u200a:\\u200apoem I, line 31\\u200a:\\u200apoem III, lines 5-7\\u200a:\\u200apoem IV, lines 49-51\\u200a:\\u200apoem VIII, lines 36-7\\u200a\"Saint Quentin\":\\u200aline 1258\\u200a. In the Fifth Fytte, Sir Richard at the Lee shelters Robin and his fellowship from the Sheriff\\'s posse comitatus: Sir Richard swears by Saint Quentin to house Robin for forty days. Saint Quentin was a 3rd-century Christian martyr whose pilgrimage cult at the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Saint-Quentin, Aisne flourished during the Middle Ages. Saint-Quentin is not far from Thiérache, site of the first encounter between Edward III and Philip VI of France during the chevauchée of 1339.. Possible source tales for the Seventh Fytte. Ohlgren draws attention to two tales which are considered part of the \"King and Subject\" tradition as described by Child: King Edward and Shepherd (hereafter called Shepherd) and King and Hermit (hereafter called Hermit). Both tales were mentioned by Child as part of his discussion of King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth (#273).[Child, V, p ??] Curiously, Child included Tanner, which survives as a 17th-century text, but he does not include either Shepherd or Hermit, both of which survive as incomplete manuscripts dated c. 1450. In Olgren\\'s study of the two tales, he has concluded that there is nothing \"to preclude their having been used as the sources for the \\'King and the Subject\\' theme in Gest.\":\\u200a12\\u200a. Shepherd is preserved as part of the same manuscript which contains Robin Hood and the Monk. Shepherd unambiguously describes Edward III as the King::\\u200a10\\u200aborn at Windsor Castle. father was a Welsh knight; mother was named Isabella. his steward is Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford. Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, are mentioned. \"Hermit\" is preserved .... Shepherd and Hermit share plot similarities: a disguised king who seeks out his subjects to listen to their complaints; he dines on what turns out to be a dinner consisting of poached venison and fowl; the subject engages the king in a drinking game; the king invites the subject to court, where the king\\'s true identity is revealed.:\\u200a10\\u200a Both tales contain interesting plot details which parallel Gest::\\u200a11\\u200aIn Shepherd, a hand-washing ritual occurs prior to the feast at court; in Gest the ritual occurs prior to Robin\\'s meals with the Knight and with the Monk.. The first meal provided by the Shepherd to the King is similar to that provided by Robin to the Knight.. The second meal provided by the Shepherd to his King is similar to the meal provided by Robin to his King.. In Hermit, the King is lured into the forest by the promise of a great-headed deer. The incident occurs five miles from Nottingham. In Gest, this is similar to Little John\\'s ruse to lure the Sheriff into the greenwood, in which Little John runs five miles to the Sheriff\\'s hunting party with news of a great green hart.Cultural memory of Edward III. Shepherd and Hermit, as well as the political poems of Minot, are examples of a cultural memory of Edward III which still existed some three or four generations after his death. (This cultural memory may have been encouraged by Henry IV, a grandson of Edward III, who had usurped the throne from Richard II, son of Edward the Black Prince, in 1399.) Edward was remembered as having concern for his subjects, and was committed to redressing injustices committed by his officials.:\\u200a12\\u200a. Another popular text was the \"De reginine principum\", which was translated (1411-12) into Middle English by Privy Seal clerk Thomas Hoccleve as the Regiment of Princes. Hoccleve addressed his poem to Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales and Duke of Lancaster (the future Henry V). Henry IV was in poor health, and his son had taken over the reins of government in 1410. In the Regiment of Princes, Hoccleve included many references to Edward\\'s personal life and events of his time. Hoccleve advices Henry to personally find out what his subjects think of him in the section \"Of Justice\". Like \"Edward the last\", Henry should travel among his subjects \"in simple array alone\" \"To hear what men said of thy person\" (modern spelling).:\\u200a12\\u200a The King is obligated to help them. If his officials are oppressing the people, he is to redress the wrongs done. Sir Richard as army recruiter?. Ohlgren draws attention to the Knight\\'s activities during the year before his 400-pound debt repayment is due to Robin Hood in the Second Fytte. The Knight\\'s income from his lands is only 400 pounds, so how is he paying for the men and equipment?. Ohlgren proposes that the money could have come from two sources: indenture and purveyance.:\\u200a5-8\\u200a Indenture was started by Edward I as a way of supplementing the number of troops raised through the feudal (tenure) levies, but it became almost standard practice under Edward III, who used it to recruit the rank and file of his armies.[1954_Lyon, p 503-4] In the 14th and 15th centuries, purveyance[MED, sense 3, 4] meant recruiting men, clothing them, furnishing the equipment for a campaign, and providing food and transportation for them to the English coast. The 100 men-at-arms mentioned in the text don\\'t seem to have been the Knight\\'s personal retinue, the uniforms being red and white. These colors belonged to Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, who served in almost all of Edward III\\'s French campaigns. Recruiting and outfitting these men could have earned the Knight between 250 and 650 pounds.:\\u200a7 Livery and fees. Livery originally referred to a lord providing food and clothing to his household servants. It later expanded to refer to the distinctive uniform worn by the lord\\'s servants. Under the original English feudalism as imported by the Normans, a tenant-in-chief\\'s feudal obligations to the king were originally defined by tenure. Those who accepted lands from the king were expected to return specified services at his command, such as fealty, suit of court, and military service. The latter was known as knight\\'s service. The English invasions of Scotland during the reign of Edward I demanded more men-at-arms and archers than the traditional feudal methods could supply. This situation became even more acute under his grandson Edward III at the beginning of the Hundred Years War. Indentures were drawn up between the king and his lords, and between the lords and their sub-tenants or captains of men, for the provision of a certain number of men-at-arms and archers. These men were equipped with weapons and furnished with distinctive clothing or badges as a means of identification.Under a strong king, such as Edward III, the increased power of regional magnates afforded by this practice could be restrained, but under a weak king, such as Richard II, abuses became rampant. In 1377, 1384, and 1388, Parliament protested against the abuses, now referred to as livery and maintenance. Parliament was concerned about the increasing number of liveried retainers involved in violence and riots who expected to escape legal retribution through the sheriffs and justices of the peace who could be retained by their lord.Throughout Gest, there are several references to the expanded use of livery and fees during the 14th and 15th centuries.. The following incidents indicate that Robin bestowed liveries upon his men (or at least provided the cloth). As mentioned above, this was considered acceptable practice during wartime under the terms of the indentures with Robin, who is considered a yeoman leader, or captain, of men.:\\u200a17\\u200a. Robin Hood and the Knight. In the First Fytte, Robin Hood agrees to provide livery to the threadbare Knight. Little John then measures out a generous three yards of scarlet and raye (striped)[MED_raye] cloth, which he hands over to the Knight.:\\u200alines 276-296\\u200aLittle John and the Cook. In the Third Fytte, on Robin\\'s behalf, Little John offers to the Cook twenty marks and two sets of clothing per year as incentive to join Robin\\'s fellowship.:\\u200alines 676-682\\u200aRobin and King Edward. In the Eighth Fytte, King Edward asks to purchase from Robin green cloth to replace their gray monk\\'s robes.:\\u200alines 1669-1676\\u200aRobin at Edward\\'s court. In the Eighth Fytte, Robin has spent all his wealth on fees for his men.:\\u200alines 1729-1736\\u200aSheriff and Little John. In the Third Fytte, the Sheriff offers to retain Little John as a member of his household for 20 marks per year.:\\u200alines 597-600\\u200aHowever, the most prominent incident is the illegal practice of \\'cloth and fee\\' described in the Second Fytte. \\'Cloth and fee\\' (another name for livery and fee) refers to the payment of money and gifts of clothing to the King\\'s justice in return for favorable legal services.:\\u200aline 426 Note\\u200a This practice became so prevalent that, in 1346, Edward III issued a statute requiring his justices to swear an oath that they would only accept \\'cloth and fee\\' from the King himself.:\\u200aline 425 Note, line 426 Note\\u200a In this episode, the Abbot is trying to defraud the Knight of his land, so he retains a County Justice, the King\\'s officer, to force the issue in the Abbot\\'s favor.:\\u200alines 371-372, 425-426\\u200a Once the Abbot has publicly insulted the Knight, the Chief Justice seeks to defuse the situation by suggesting the Abbot offer to purchase the land outright.:\\u200alines 465-66, 465 Note\\u200a The ridiculously low price offered by the Abbot is yet another insult to the Knight, which prompts the Knight to empty the bag of Robin\\'s 400 pounds onto the Abbot\\'s table. The Knight then declares to all present to bear witness to the fact that he has redeemed his land legally. Peasants\\' revolt of 1381. Most of the initial historical interpretations placing Gest during the 14th century were based upon a misreading of Child\\'s discussion of a possible date of composition for Gest. Child placed his conclusion (\"There are no firm grounds on which to base an opinion.\") at the end of a lengthy discussion in which he unsuccessfully attempted to date Gest to 1400 or earlier.:\\u200a40\\u200a Based upon this misreading, for the next century scholars continued to propose that since Piers Plowman is connected with the Peasants\\' revolt, and since the priest Sloth mentions \"rymes of Robyn Hode\", then Robin Hood is also connected. However, Langland gives no indication as to what these rhymes are, and there are no surviving rhymes from Langland\\'s lifetime.. According to Richard Almond and A. J. Pollard:\\u200a55-6\\u200a, the association between Robin Hood and the issues of the Peasants\\' Revolt was first made by Rodney Hilton in 1958, when he described Robin Hood as \"a free peasant representing peasant ideology for a peasant audience\".:\\u200a55\\u200a However, in 1961, J. C. Holt rebutted Hilton, asserting that the Robin Hood tales were composed in castle and manor halls, a position Holt expanded upon in his book. Since then, a consensus has emerged that Robin Hood represented a new social group above the peasants and below those who bore a coat of arms, a group which is often referred to as the \"middling sort\".:\\u200a56\\u200a  Gest does not appear to be concerned with peasants\\' issues, and is not particularly similar in themes with surviving songs of the peasantry.:\\u200a37-38 Forest law and poaching. In Gest, several references to Robin Hood\\'s fellowship poaching the King\\'s deer are mentioned as passing remarks.  They are not further developed, however, and do not appear to be a core part of the early Robin Hood legend. Mentions include: when itemizing the Knight\\'s dinner menu in the First Fytte:\\u200alines 127-132\\u200a, and the King\\'s dinner menu in the Seventh Fytte:\\u200alines 1569-1572\\u200a. in the transition between the Sixth and Seventh Fyttes, the Gest poet speaks of how King Edward travelled throughout Lancashire, without seeing the usual large herds of deer:\\u200alines 1425-1432\\u200a. when Robin Hood accosts the disguised King Edward in the Seventh Fytte:\\u200alines 1507-1508 As a ballad. Gest was included by Francis Child as part of his influential collection of ballads, the Child Ballads, as number 117 in volume 3 of his collection The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.  He had earlier published a version in 1859.  Its quatrain structure and rhyme scheme fits with other Middle English ballads.  However, Gest, along with other traditional border ballads of the Anglo-Scottish border and ballads of Robin Hood, has its own distinctions from other Child ballads. They are narratives, which generally lack a chorus or refrain, and appear to have been composed as recitations before an audience. Only Gest is considered comparable to the Danish and English heroic ballads, the epic poem Beowulf, and the great Middle English romances - Havelok the Dane and The Tale of Gamelyn.In the Roud Folk Song Index, Gest is listed as number 70. Rhyme and rhythm schemes. Thus begins the Gest; calling all free-born gentlemen to hear tales of the good yeoman Robyn Hode.  The lines within the quatrain have an ABCB rhyme scheme, in which the last words of lines 2 and 4 rhyme, but the last words of lines 1 and 3 may or may not. The words in each line also have a rhythm or beat due to the combinations of stressed and unstressed syllables. Lines 1 and 3 have four stressed syllables, while lines 2 and 4 have three stressed syllables. Each stressed syllable is preceded by one or two unstressed syllables. Another excerpt, which if read aloud has stressed syllables in bold font to demonstrate the intended rhythm: A musical interpretation of this vocal pattern was recorded in 2002 by Bob Frank in a modern English version entitled A Little Gest of Robin Hood. Frank accompanied himself with an acoustic guitar, while reciting the lines in a talking blues style. Fowler\\'s reconstruction of narrative ballad history. As the Child Ballads were being prepared for publication, there was an ongoing debate among those who studied ballad origins. Those who considered that ballads originated as communal songs and dances were known as communalists; those who supported the opposing position, that ballads were written by individual authors, were known as individualists. This debate involved questions that have since been \"discarded as subjects for fruitful inquiry\". In other words, the question of communal versus individual origination can never be answered due to lack of historical evidence. The current consensus is that, since so little is known about the origins of the earliest ballads, their origins can only be deduced from clues within the texts themselves on a case-by-case basis. It was advocated by the English historian J R Maddicott in a series of articles in the journal Past & Present (1958–61) and re-iterated in 1978.:\\u200a233\\u200aIn 1968, D. C. Fowler proposed a new reconstruction of the history of the narrative ballad, based upon his study of Gest, and the oldest Robin Hood ballads (Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and the Potter). His proposal was that the narrative ballad is a subcategory of folksong that uses a narrative form. The narrative ballad, as it appeared in England during the 15th–16th centuries, was a result of the merger of several different traditions. The first tradition was folksong, which appeared about the 12th century, and became more widespread during the 13th–15th centuries with the appearance of carols and religious songs sung in the vernacular. The second tradition was itself the result of a 14th-century blending of the 12th century French courtly romances (such as the Arthurian romances) with the Old English alliterative traditional poetry to form a new genre of English metrical narrative romance (such as those included in the Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës).:\\u200a5-10\\u200a These romances are usually associated with royal court minstrels, but minstrels were also present at the great baronial halls of the north of England.:\\u200a8\\u200a These powerful barons, such as the House of Percy, the House of Neville, and the York and Lancaster cadet branches of the Plantagenet dynasty, maintained courts which rivalled the Royal Court in London.. Fowler\\'s proposal was both opposed and applauded for his attempt to construct a history of ballads based upon the earliest dates of surviving texts and not upon comparative structure and form. Independent support for minstrel origins was offered by several historians. Maurice Keen, in his first edition (1961) of The Outlaws of Medieval Legend argued that the ballad form of the Robin Hood stories indicated a primitive popular origin. In the Introduction to his second edition (1977), Keen stated that criticism forced him to abandon his original arguments  He now supported the position that the narrative ballads were minstrel compositions.  In 1989, James Holt also advocated a minstrel origin for the Robin Hood ballads when he proposed that the original audience was the yeoman servants of the English feudal households, especially those of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, a grandson of Henry III. Holt proposed the ballads were then spread from the great halls to market-places, taverns and inns, where the common people heard them.:\\u200a12 Sung or recited?. Fowler contended that the Robin Hood ballads were distinct from \"true\" ballads because they were recited, not sung.:\\u200a5-10\\u200a His evidence is twofold: (1) unrelated manuscripts, approximately from the same time at which Gest may have been compiled, which mention Robin Hood, and (2) internal passages from Gest and the two oldest Robin Hood ballads in manuscript form which are approximately contemporaneous with Gest: Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and the Potter.:\\u200a65-67\\u200aThis interpretation of the contemporary manuscripts was originally proposed by Chambers, which Fowler incorporated into his hypothesis. The importance of the manuscripts is not only that they mentioned Robin Hood, but also what they said about him. The manuscripts are::\\u200a65-71\\u200a. Dives and Pauper (dated to ca 1410) refers to \"tale or a song of robyn hode\"According to Fowler, the use of the words sing or song refers, not to the melodic singing of a folksong, but to a type of chanting known as plainsong. This view can be supported by one of the meanings of the Middle English singen (\"to sing\"): to relate a story in song or verse; to recite a poem.Scotichronicon (dated to ca 1450), written by Bower in Latin, uses the phrases \"cantitare delectantur\" and \"recitantur\" in its mention of Robin Hood and Little John in the then-popular \"romanciis, mimos, ei bardanos\"                    cantitare delectantur     loosely translated as \"delightful singing\" or                                                         as \"delightful recitation\":\\u200acantare, senses 1,5\\u200a:\\u200adelectantia\\u200a                    recitantur                      means as \"reading aloud\":\\u200arecitare, sense 1\\u200a                    romanciis                      means \"narratives, stories, or historical accounts\":\\u200aromancia\\u200a                    mimos                           means \"mimic plays\":\\u200amimologus\\u200a. In other words, Bower is talking about delightful stories about Robin Hood which are being performed in song and/or recitation.Historia Majoris Britanniae (dated 1521), written by Mair in Latin, contains a remark that the exploits of Robin Hood are known throughout England in \"cantibus\"                    cantibus                           means \"a singing tone in the delivery of an orator\":\\u200acanticum, sense II.B\\u200a. Perhaps \"a singing tone\" is not descriptive enough; it is rhythm, cadance, and word choice that makes a great orator. Churchill\\'s second and third speeches delivered during the Battle of France, as well as Franklin Roosevelt\\'s first inaugural address and Day of infamy address are examples from two of the masters of the radio address.The internal evidence offered by Fowler consists of passages within the three ballads::\\u200a65-67\\u200a. the use of speech verbs, such as speak, talk, and tell:. Robin Hood and the Potter contains the line \"Now speak we of Roben Hode\":\\u200aline 308\\u200a. Robin Hood and the Monk ends with the line \"Thus ends the talking of the monk/And Robyn Hode ...\":\\u200alines 355-6\\u200a. the opening stanza of Gest contains \"I shall you tell of a good yeoman,\" :\\u200aline 3\\u200a. the use of transitions. between Fyttes 1 and 2 :\\u200alines 325-36\\u200a. at the beginning of Fytte 4 :\\u200alines 817-20\\u200a. between the end of the Monk tale and resumption of the Sorrowful Knight tale in Fytte 4 :\\u200alines 1041–44\\u200a. the use of frequent asides to the audienceThe most compelling internal evidence is the repeated use of the \"Lythe and listen\" formulaic.:\\u200a65-67\\u200a It is found: at the beginning of Fyttes 1, 3, 6:\\u200alines 1, 573, 1265\\u200a. in the second stanza of Fytte 5:\\u200aline 1125\\u200a\"lythe\" comes from Old Norse[U of MI\\'s MED]. When used in the phrase \"lythe and listen\" it means \"to hear, to be attentive\" (as in the colloquialism \"listen up!\"). The Gest poet uses this formulaic whenever a new tale is about to begin. Considering the length of the ballad, it is possible that the ballad was broken up into sections for performance; and the \"Lythe and listen\" would alert the audience that the performance was about to resume. Classification of Gest and other Robin Hood ballads. Scholars have discussed how best to classify Gest: is it a ballad, a poem, an epic or epic poem, a combination, a romance, or something else?  Both Francis James Child and his successor George Lyman Kittredge gathered about themselves a group of students to continue the study of the Child ballads. Francis Barton Gummere was a student who assisted Child in compiling the ballads. Gummere later wrote two books which were based upon their collaboration: Old English Ballads and The Popular Ballad. In the latter book, Gummere described a classification scheme based upon the ballad structure and form.. Two other students of Kittredge expanded upon Gummere\\'s classification scheme. Walter Morris Hart studied under Kittredge and later wrote Ballad and Epic. A Study in the Development of the Narrative Art. Hart examined ballads from each of Gummere\\'s classes, and compared Gest to Beowulf and the Song of Roland.:\\u200a354-5\\u200a Hart looked more closely at the levels of elaboration and accretion, among ballads of the same class and between ballads of different classes. Elaboration (defined by Hart as growth from within):\\u200a355\\u200a describes the differences in choral ballads and narrative ballads. As the narrative becomes more important, the characterisations, the surroundings, and the inter-relationships become more detailed. This increased level of detail allows for a more nuanced portrait of an individual\\'s character, motives, and an understanding of their state of mind. Accretion (defined by Hart as the accumulation of independent events):\\u200a355\\u200a is the complexity which arises in the narrative as the central character becomes a heroic figure, and represents the community\\'s ideals.:\\u200a354-5\\u200a On the basis of its elaboration and accretion, Hart judged Gest as \"an epic in the making\".:\\u200a347\\u200a In Hart\\'s opinion, Gest is surpassed only by the Danish and English heroic ballads, and Beowulf and Roland.:\\u200a357–8\\u200aWilliam Hall Clawson wrote his doctoral thesis on the Robin Hood ballads, which was later published as The Gest of Robin Hood. Prior to its publication, Clawson wrote an article, Ballad and Epic, which summarized his synthesis of the work done by Gummere and Hart.  In 1974, J. B. Bessinger Jr., contending that the term \"epic\" was confusing, called Gest \"a minor heroic poem\" on the basis of his comparison of Gest with Havelok the Dane and The Tale of Gamelyn.  Extending his comparison to the themes and content of Thomas Malory\\'s Le Morte d\\'Arthur, Bessinger concluded that Gest lies somewhere between a ballad, epic, and a romance. Scholarship. Various scholars have written on Gest.  The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, by Francis James Child, was very influential and popular in spreading knowledge of the oldest surviving ballads in English literature, although more evidence has been discovered since the late 1880s that Child did not have access to at the time.  William Hall Clawson wrote extensively on Gest in 1909.  Medievalist D. C. Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad in 1968. In 1989, two historians, Barrie Dobson and John Taylor, wrote \"Rymes of Robyn Hood\" on the subject. In 1997, Stephen Knight and Thomas H. Ohlgren published Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales, a collection of all the pre-17th-century tales of Robin Hood, arranged in chronological order. Their book now forms the core of the Robin Hood Project of the University of Rochester\\'s Middle English Texts website. In 2013 Ohlgren and linguist Lister M. Matheson published Early Rymes of Robin Hood, which includes \"as-is\" transcriptions of all the earliest surviving copies of Gest for use by scholars. Adaptations. Among early ballads, Robin Hood\\'s Death is likely the most related, being a longer telling of the same story as the final six stanzas of Gest.  Whether Death was an expansion of Gest, Gest an abridgment of Death, or both were based on a lost common source is impossible to say.Various motifs in Gest reoccur in both contemporaneous ballads and later ones.  Robin Hood robs a cleric in both Robin Hood and the Bishop and Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford; interacts with the king in a mostly friendly fashion in The King\\'s Disguise, and Friendship with Robin Hood and many later stories; and gets involved in archery contests constantly.With the rise of English Romanticism in the late 18th century came a resurgence in the popularity of the Robin Hood ballads. Gest was reprinted several times as part of various anthologies, the first of which was Robin Hood: A collection of all the Ancient Poems Songs and Ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated Outlaw, edited by Joseph Ritson in 1795 (followed by later editions in 1820, 1832 and 1885).  Ivanhoe by Walter Scott was greatly influenced by Ritson\\'s collection and likely an inspiration for the character of Locksley in it.  Echoes from Gest can be found throughout Ivanhoe: in its various locations in the West Riding of Yorkshire; in the use of elements of Gest in key scenes at the Tournament of Ashby; and in Scott\\'s re-use of the Gest poet\\'s feasting scene motif to highlight important plot twists.. Gest has influenced modern versions of the Robin Hood tales, especially in the basic plot motifs such as Robin robbing someone and sharing the loot with another who is more worthy.  However, its main stories are not always seen as much as the other Robin Hood ballads, most notably the story of The Sorrowful Knight. The adaption which bears obvious traces is the popular children\\'s book written by Howard Pyle in 1883. Pyle\\'s book was a huge influence on how Hollywood would later portray Robin Hood. Howard Pyle\\'s Merry Adventures. Howard Pyle\\'s contribution to the Robin Hood revival of the 19th century was his richly illustrated children\\'s book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. Following in the footsteps of Walter Scott, Pyle had Robin Hood roaming Sherwood Forest (not Barnsdale) during the reign of King Richard the Lionheart (not comely King Edward).  Pyle did adapt the tale of the Sorrowful Knight, perhaps the most unique tale of Gest, in Chapters I-II of Part the Fifth of his work.:\\u200a157-184\\u200a  The story is heavily modified from that in Gest (Pyle replaced most of Fytte 1 with his own version of how the Knight received his money; not from Robin, but from the Bishop of Hereford, who \"conveniently\" came to Robin\\'s feast). Writing in an era of it being cheap to write in longform, Pyle extended the story with richly detailed descriptions and drawings, while the compiler of Gest, needing to make something short and punchy enough to potentially be recited by a minstrel, was more spare in his prose. Pyle also includes the episode of the wrestling yeoman, but to tie it more clearly into the novel, he made the man David of Doncaster, a Merry Man from Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow, though even this made the episode odd among Pyle\\'s novelistic effects. .

      "{'input': ' By country. Argentina. In the midst of the Argentine War of Independence and the Auxiliary Expeditions to Upper Peru, there was a climate of tension between Peru, loyal to the Spanish Crown, and the Junta de Buenos Aires seeking the independence of the Rio de la Plata and spreading the May Revolution to all of South America, which generated warlike confrontations between Peruvian supporters of the counterrevolution and Argentine supporters of the revolution; In the midst of these events, there were some signs of anti-Peruvianism in the most conflictive stages of those events, since these troops devastated the region and caused local rejection of any union with the \"porteños\", to the extent that there were Peruvians who did not want direct borders with the so-called \"aggressive\" Buenos Aires (due to their invasions of Charcas). Samples of this anti-Peruvian aggressiveness occurred when the Argentine government ordered the execution of the leaders of the Córdoba Counterrevolution, which were having support of the Viceroyalty of Peru, also served to teach a \"lesson to the leaders of Peru\", since at first it was intended to gather the prisoners so that they could be sent, without making detours, either to Buenos Aires or to the city of Córdoba \"according to the most convenient\", however the order to execute the counterrevolutionary leaders at the moment of their capture, a decision promoted by Mariano Moreno and which had been taken by the full Primera Junta, except for Manuel Alberti (who excused himself due to his ecclesiastical character), served as a warning of hostility of the junta towards the peoples opposed to the revolution, with emphasis on Cordoba and Peruvians.\"Reservada. Los sagrados derechos del Rey y de la Patria, han armado el brazo de la justicia y esta Junta, ha fulminado sentencia contra los conspiradores de Córdoba acusados por la notoriedad de sus delitos y condenados por el voto general de todos los buenos.

The sacred rights of the King and the Homeland have armed the arm of justice and this Junta has struck down a sentence against the conspirators of Córdoba accused for the notoriety of their crimes and convicted by the general vote of all the good ones. The Board orders that they be harquebused Dn. Santiago Liniers, Don Juan Gutiérrez de la Concha, the Bishop of Córdoba, Dn. Victorino Rodríguez, Colonel Allende and the Royal Official Dn.

This punishment must be the basis of the stability of the new system and a lesson for the chiefs of Peru, who advance to a thousand excesses for the hope of impunity and is at the same time the proof of the usefulness and energy with which this Expedition fills the important objects what is it intended for.\" (English)There were also signs of Peruvian-phobia on the part of the Argentines of the Junta when Manuel Belgrano exposed on July 6, 1816, in front of the deputies of the Congress of Tucumán in two meetings, a proposal to establish an almost nominal monarchy, discussing first about choosing a European prince and then a Peruvian sovereign from the descendants of the Incas to offer the throne, it was most likely projected that the title would correspond to Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru, the only known surviving brother of the Inca noble, Túpac Amaru II, although they also considered Dionisio Inca Yupanqui, a mestizo jurist and soldier who had been educated in Europe and who was the representative of Peru at the Cortes of Cádiz, or Juan Andrés Jiménez de León Manco Cápac, a mestizo cleric and soldier who earned his fame for opposing the excessive collection of tribute and that he participated as a military commander in the uprising of Juan José Castelli. Only four days after making this proclamation, the great announcement of the Independence of Argentina took place, with a large majority of the assembly members opting for the suggested monarchical form that, in addition, should have its headquarters in the city of Cuzco, the capital of the projected New Kingdom. Only Godoy Cruz and part of his collaborators demanded that said capital be in Buenos Aires. According to this \"Plan del Inca\", it would be an effective and constitutional parliamentary-style government, similar to the British one, in order to achieve prompt international recognition of Argentine independence. His proposal to establish a parliamentary Inca monarchy was ridiculed by his contemporaries who supported the formation of a republic, the original project was rejected mainly for reasons of anti-Peruvian racism. The Buenos Aires delegates expressed their total rejection of the delusional idea, almost without being heard. It is said that one of them came to shout there: \"I\\'d rather be dead than serve a king with flip flops!\"; and that the journalists from Buenos Aires mocked the decision, assuring that now he would have to go look for \"a dirty-legged king in some grocery store or tavern in the Altiplano\". The Congress of Tucumán finally decided to reject the Inca\\'s plan because anti-peruvian fellings, creating in its place a republican and centralist state with its capital in Buenos Aires.. Another example of anti-Peruvianism, as well as anti-Chileanism and Hispanophobia, was Brown\\'s privateering expedition to the Pacific, sponsored by the government of Buenos Aires, where ships were sent on a privateering expedition to the Pacific coast against civilians, without engaging them in a regular naval warfare against the military, whose main targets were the ports of Chile and Peru, in order to weaken Spanish trade, as well as Peruvian. Although the preparations were carried out in secret, some royalists from Buenos Aires tried to pass communications to Chile to prepare defense actions, but the governor of Cuyo, José de San Martín, managed to intercept those attempts. One of the main objectives of the corsairs Argentinians was the Port of Callao, which was attacked in January 1816. \"On January 22, the perverse Brown woke up anchored near the mouth of the Rimac River with the greatest insolence imaginable, as if he knew that there was no gunboat or armed ship in the port. His forces were composed of four ships and a pailebot. Three of them went ahead until they anchored in the same bay, fired a few cannon shots as if to mock them, they were answered by the castles, they raised anchor again and kept looking around until midnight, when they returned to shoot at the port, and They managed to do the damage by sinking one of the ships that remained at anchor, the frigate Fuente-Hermosa.\". Such was the hostility of the Argentine corsairs towards the Peruvian population, that it has been recorded that several travelers from Peru to Europe (especially friars of the Catholic Church), at the moment of undertaking the return from the Brazilian coast to Peru, arrived in to prefer the land route, from Goiás and Mato Grosso, to reach Peru via the Amazon, \"rather than run the risk of falling into the hands of corsairs from La Plata at sea.\"On the other hand, some historians, with indigenist, Hispanist or revisionist orientations of the nationalist current, have wanted to affirm that the Argentine Liberator himself, Don José de San Martin, could have been an anti-Peruvian figure, questioning whether a foreigner would arrive (San Martín) to proclaim independence. An independence, considered imposed (favoring the historiographical thesis of independence granted, and not achieved or conceived) and very probably against the will of the Peruvians (from which previous declarations of independence would have already emerged, such as the Cuzco Rebellion, later repressed by the Peruvians themselves loyal to the Viceroyalty, and without the need for the intervention of an invading army), based on some phrases such as:. \"I believe that all the power of the supreme being is not enough to liberate that despicable country (Peru): only Bolívar, supported by force, can do it.\". It is also known that San Martín wanted the disputed territory of Upper Peru, administered since 1810 by the Viceroyalty of Peru, to be handed over to the United Provinces of Río de la Plata, which, although it would be somewhat predictable on his part (because it was an Argentine) in the exercise of a realpolitik, on the other hand it would be a sign of anti-Peruvianism on his part in the face of vague promises that he made to warlords, like Andrés de Santa Cruz, over the territory. Given this, he was allegedly accused of being dishonest with his ambiguous promises that he gave to Peruvian politicians who supported his government, since the Protectorate of San Martín de facto controlled the Atacama Party and was also claiming part of the territories of the current La Paz and Pando. That ended up generating a climate of mistrust, where the praises and praise of the Peruvians to the Liberator would have been apparent, in the midst of hostilities towards the Argentine caudillo. In the secret session of the Peruvian Congress, on September 27, 1822, suspicion and fear were expressed that San Martín tried to seize the provinces of Upper Peru, Arequipa and Cuzco.In addition, San Martín came to be accused of falling into a serious anti-Peruvian hypocrisy with the monarchical project of the Protectorate of San Martín, by preferring the coming of European princes (betraying several nationalist Peruvians), leaving aside the already existing and millennial institutions national monarchists in Peru to imitate the parliamentary constitutionalism of the English and French in the restoration (being accused of being Anglophile and Frenchified by Peruvian Hispanicism), as well as having little or no consideration for monarchical proposals that represented the interests of the indigenous nobility (being accused of Criollo elitist by the Peruvian indigenism). For example, the case of the indigenous nobility of the Cajamarca region, which, after obtaining knowledge of the sworn independence on January 8, 1821 by Torre Tagle (despite the exclusion of indigenous representatives from the Cabildo de Naturales and famous curacas in rural populations, such as Manuel Anselmo Carhuaguatay), he tried to introduce himself and propose that the form of government of the new Peruvian state should correspond to a descendant of Atahualpa who lived in the town, the most notorious being Don Manuel Soto Astopilco (main cacique of the Seven Huarangas of the province), in addition to suggesting the rebirth of the State of Tahuantinsuyo and its right to the crown. No news was recorded that he tried to invoke possible links with the distant and exhausted Incas of Cusco (mostly more favorable to the Royal Army of Peru). And although the proposal was heard and notified to Torre Tagle, no one in the government of San Martín responded to this request. Which shows that for the Creole oligarchy in the Trujillo Intendancy there was a lack of interest towards the indigenous political Society, for which the successors of the Incas were not considered for any alternative government. Leaving a tacit glimpse that the liberal movement of San Martin could end in a monarchical government, or perhaps a republican one, but in either case, it would be led by the Criollo elite and not by indigenous people, no matter how stately and regal lineage they could make ostentation San Martín\\'s intentions had been frustrated not only by the irruption of Simón Bolívar in the destiny of Independence, but also by the strong opposition that he encountered among some of the Peruvians themselves, and by the discredit that the errors and nonsense of Bernardo de Monteagudo (an obscure character who, in addition to being one of the main people responsible for the murders of Manuel Rodríguez and the Carrera brothers, was a convinced monarchist), perpetuated as one of the most disastrous characters for the history of the emancipation of America for his radical Jacobin tendencies. Between December 1821 and February 1822, Monteagudo issued a series of resolutions aimed at banishing, confiscating part of their assets and prohibiting the exercise of commerce to peninsular Spaniards who had not been baptized. Although there are no investigations about how many supporters of the king left Peru because of the serious episodes of its independence, as well as the political change itself that they did not want to recognize; some estimates point to between ten and twelve thousand. Ricardo Palma, in his historical study on Monteagudo, estimates the number of Spaniards expelled from Peru by his decision at 4,000 (despite the fact that many of these families were already integrated into the Peruvian nation during the miscegenation process, among them would be the expulsion of the Archbishop of Lima). According to Canadian historian Timothy E. Anna, these actions were \"an unparalleled act of violence and unprecedented human rights abuse.\" It is very certain that this popular unrest was one of the causes for the riots that surrounded the dismissal of Monteagudo on July 25, 1822, since it was perceived, in the feelings of the Lima population of all social classes, as a very unfair act because it is an abuse against Spaniards who had lived in Peru for decades and who had an important social and economic role. According to Scarlett O\\'Phelan, Monteagudo\\'s measures were about to generate the annihilation of the social group of merchants who were active in very important areas for the Peruvian economy (these being agriculture and, above all, mining). This was due to the fact that the large, small, and medium-sized owners (all expropriated without much difference) were responsible for managing the most vital aspects of the viceroyalty\\'s economy. It is also known that battalions of Argentine origin generated complaints from the civilian population due to the \"havoc and exhortations\" they carried out on the farms, devastating the crops and even attacking (sometimes seriously injuring) a large part of the members of the Peasant, who worked the land.All these measures, according to the revisionist perspective, would have been allowed by San Martín, knowing that the loss of a large Peruvian capital would benefit the interests of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata so that it could project as the industrial leader of the South American continent, to the detriment of the Peruvians, since such a compulsive movement against the Hispanic social groups (who were leaders who organized, maintained and dynamized the productive bases that made the bases of the national economy work) did not take place in Chile and Argentina; thus evidencing that primarily the rivalries present in the regional groups of economic power in Latin America, for which both Chileans and Argentines (whose states financed the liberating expedition with the contributions of their bourgeoisies) had feelings and interests contrary to their regional equivalents in Peru (including the Inca nobility for their royalist tendencies), rather than emanating an idealized Spanish-American fraternity against imperialism. “In the period 1821-1822, the liberator José de San Martín and Bernardo Monteagudo, his trusted minister, expropriated and squandered the mercantile and economic elite of Lima, without achieving the definitive independence of Peru. Monteagudo had little regard for the level of civilization and the democratic possibilities of Peruvians. His main objective was to eradicate the Spanish threat in independent La Plata and Chile at any cost, including the economic ruin of Peru. He confiscated wealth and other resources to organize local spy networks and covert operations, clearly damaging to gaining the confidence of the local population and their support for the cause of independence.. (…) The kidnapping policy inaugurated by Monteagudo further undermined a weak tradition of the right to property and laid the foundations for politically motivated expropriations. The agricultural and urban properties confiscated from royalist Spaniards and Creoles, mainly in the central coast region, were valued at approximately two million pesos. This policy caused greater economic problems and a drop in investment.. (...) Eventually, most of the expropriated assets were awarded to military officers who sought compensation and rewards for their patriotic exploits. Among the high-ranking officers who received these rewards we have Antonio José de Sucre, Bernardo O\\'Higgins, and José Rufino Echenique. Juan Francisco Ryes, Blas Sardeña and José María Plaza, among others. In the provinces, local officials repeated the abuses of power and the plundering committed in the name of the patriot cause. (...) To make matters worse, Admiral Thomas Cochrane (British), whose naval services and expenses had remained unpaid, appropriated the reserves of silver bars that had been painfully and arrogantly accumulated during the government of San Martín. Cochrane was the commander of the Chilean \"liberation\" fleet and also benefited from the capture and hijacking of Peruvian merchant ships. A French diplomat informed his bosses in Paris that the lack of popular support for freedom and independence was explained by the corruption of the new separatist authorities and their infighting. Another diplomatic envoy attributed the weakness of these nascent governments to the distribution of official positions through protection and intrigue instead of recognition of merit. These weak organizational bases provided fertile conditions for corruption and abuse of power.”. Later, during the founding of the State of Alto Peru, there were anti-Peruvian sectors in Argentina that saw the independence of Bolivia (and the renunciation of its claims by the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to the sovereignty of that territory) as something tolerable with in order to avoid the aggrandizement of Peru (coinciding with Bolívar, Sucre and Santander to avoid restoring the power that Peru had during the viceregal era), which had been a great problem for the commercial and military interests of Buenos Aires during the wars that there was between the Junta and the Peruvian Viceroyalty. Also because it was expected to obtain the support of Sucre and the Bolivian state, together with the support of Gran Colombia, for the War in Brazil, even if that was at the expense of Peruvian interests. During the War against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, relations between the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the Argentine Confederation had deteriorated, among other reasons due to Bolivian President Andrés de Santa Cruz\\'s support for unitary groups that had carried out at least four incursions since the southern Bolivia to the northern Argentine provinces in the years before the war. This led to anti-Peruvian measures on the part of the Argentine Government, such as that of February 13, 1837, where Rosas declared closed all commercial, epistolary and any kind of communication between the inhabitants of the Argentine Confederation and those of Peru and Bolivia, declaring \" traitor to the country\" to anyone who crossed the border into those countries. Both confederations did not have formal diplomatic relations, so the declaration was intended to externalize the break in relations between the two countries. Although Juan Manuel de Rosas was not anti-Peruvian, since he would declare war on Santa Cruz and his supporters, but not on the Peruvian states, it can be considered an episode of anti-Peruvianism in the history of Argentina, since the concern that the federal caudillo would have, in front of the power that Peru would be obtaining, in the Manifiesto de las razones que legitiman la Declaración de Guerra contra el gobierno del General Santa Cruz, Titulado Protector de la Confederación Perú-Boliviana [Manifesto of the reasons that legitimize the Declaration of War against the government of General Santa Cruz, Entitled Protector of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation]. \"If the prepotency of Peru, if its population and resources were worth, as Santa Cruz has claimed, to justify its policy, the government in charge of Foreign Relations of the Argentine Confederation would seize them to justify the war against the Peruvian Confederation. -Bolivian (...) if there was no balance between Peru and Bolivia, will it exist between the United States and the Argentine Confederation? (...) that fusion under the aegis of a conqueror is dangerous and the propensity of Peru to aggrandize it does not promise Bolivia neither security nor rest.\" During the War of the Triple Alliance, Peru was a country that protested against the alleged attempts to conquer Paraguay by the member countries of the Triple Alliance (of which Argentina was a part together with Uruguay and Brazil). For the rest of the continent, this war was perceived as an attempt to conquer and divide Paraguay among the allies. The attempt against the independence of one of the countries of the continent was feared as a terrible precedent for potential geopolitical disorders and possible expansionist projects in the governments of the area, Argentina being very frowned upon in the eyes of Peru. The controversial Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance was seen in Peruvian diplomacy as a violation of Paraguay\\'s sovereignty and integrity as a country. Thus, the perception of that war was understood, in the public eye, as the arrogance of 3 allied countries that wanted to seize Paraguay\\'s territory and even destroy its sovereignty, generating analogies with the Second French intervention in Mexico or the Spanish-South American War, that happened simultaneously during the decade of the 60s of the XIX century, comparing them as a form of imperialism not different from that of the Europeans. Seen in this way, no distinction was made regarding a conquest, especially of a Latin American country, by an American government or a European government, in the eyes of society, both acts were reprehensible. Peruvian diplomacy based its principles on continental solidarity (product of Pan-Americanism) and the defense of national sovereignty and integrity, especially the Amazonian ambitions of Brazilian interests and their expansionist advances, which were now related to the Argentines. Evidence of the public condemnation of Peru towards this policy of conquest, by the Brazilians and Argentines against Paraguay, was shown in an edition of the newspaper El Comercio, dated 10/8/1866, which responded to accusations of the anti-peruvian Argentine press that there was a lack of impartiality in the country due to Peru\\'s sympathy with Paraguay. Given this peruvian support to paraguayans, Argentina reacted with anti-Peruvian positions, refusing to be a country a member of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain in the War of the Chincha Islands; In addition, the diplomacy practiced by the Triple Alliance sought to separate the Pacific governments (Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador) and thus dissolve the Quadruple Alliance. Regarding possible profitable differences, Bolivia was definitely the most vulnerable country, being a priority for Argentine diplomacy. Thus, Argentine and Uruguayan agents tried to seduce the Bolivians, telling them that the scope of the quadruple alliance treaty was not justified, while there were Bolivian territorial claims against the Peruvians and Chileans that the Bolivians still feared would not be able to defend them. Argentine diplomacy considered the interference of the Peruvians in the war against Paraguay, as well as in the internal affairs of the Argentine state, as something of less relevance compared to the interference of the Chileans, despite the fact that Peru and Chile collaborated together (until end of 1867) against the objectives of the Triple Alliance, which would demonstrate discriminatory conduct of Argentine diplomacy against the Peruvians, portrayed as servile puppets and marionette of the Chileans. Meanwhile, Argentine diplomats came to accuse Chile of meddling in Bolivian politics, manipulating them to carry out anti-Argentine policies; and support the Revolution of the Colorados, carried out by federal opponents of the government of President Mitre.The dissident press of Argentina and Uruguay (opposed to their governments and in solidarity with Chile and Peru), which questioned the foreign policy carried out by their foreign ministries, was attacked by their respective governments, being restricted and even prohibited from circulating in Argentina. Meanwhile, the newspapers of the Spanish immigrant communities, extolling the action of the Spanish navy in the South Pacific against the Peruvian and Chilean navies (during the Spanish-South American War), circulated freely in the cities. Argentine, which evidenced anti-Peruvian and anti-Chilean biases. Another example of these biases occurs when analyzing and comparing the newspapers El Mercurio of Valparaíso and La Nación Argentina of Buenos Aires. Although, the 2 newspapers had links with the elites of their countries, and shared the commitment to vindicate the prevailing ideologies in the Criollo oligarchies (economic and political liberalism) in tune with the modernizing trends of the time. They also differed in their points of view to conceive of Americanism, being clearly distant in their approaches. While El Mercurio was totally convinced in promoting the cause of American solidarity, without making distinctions between brother and equal countries, La Nación, for its part, expressed contempt for these excessively fraternal tendencies, invoking the dichotomy between civilization and barbarism as a criterion to privilege before defining the American cause (presenting himself to the civilized Argentine and Uruguayan society as opposed to Paraguayan and Peruvian barbarism), in order to justify his actions in the war against Paraguay, as well as the repression of the liberal Buenos Aires government to the conservative uprisings through the interior of the country; They also wanted to legitimize the Eurocentric tendencies present in the Argentine elite and their unreserved acceptance of the prevailing social Darwinism, where Peruvian society (and the mestizo heritage in Latin America in general) was frowned upon for not being majority white societies, generating contempt.Also, during the 1978 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that the Argentine dictator, Jorge Rafael Videla, tried to psychologically frighten the Peruvian soccer team by entering the team\\'s locker room, shortly before the soccer match between Peru and Argentina.On the other hand, the foreign minister of Peru, José de la Puente, during November 1978, welcomed the Argentine ambassador to Lima, who was an admiral whose objective was to achieve a military alliance between the two countries in case there was a war against Chile. . The Peruvian foreign minister was suspicious of potential anti-Peruvian feelings of the Argentine state based on historical experiences, responding to his offer with the following words:. \"You have the bad luck of meeting a man who knows a lot about history (...) While we lost six thousand men and part of the national territory [in the War of the Pacific], you took advantage of the precise moment to peacefully conquer La Patagonia (...) Now you want Peru to enter the war, but later, while Chile and Argentina make up, we lose Arequipa”. In the 20th century, given the significant presence of illegal Peruvian immigrants in Argentina, in order to avoid their massive expulsion, the governments of both countries agreed to sign a reciprocal Migration Agreement in August 1998, which would make it possible to regularize the situation of Argentine migrants and Peruvians in the host country, granting a period of 180 days for this. The bilateral agreement will recognize the rights of the Peruvian worker in Argentina, but only up to a period of 12 months, after which he must undergo a Immigration Law, which various sectors of the opposition, as well as the Church in Argentina, had described as xenophobic and racist with anti-Peruvian overtones. Another of the institutions that showed a special interest in the migratory situation of Peruvians was the Commission of Peruvian Ladies Resident in Argentina, chaired by Mrs. Carmen Steimann. In a meeting organized by the Peruvian community in Buenos Aires, Ms. Steimann would protest the attitude of the Argentine gendarmerie, accusing them of carrying out an obsessive and cruel persecution of immigrants, mostly just for being Peruvian and Bolivian. In addition, Carlos Menem is often accused of having an anti-Peruvian attitude after selling weapons to Ecuador when it was in a war against Peru, generating another accusation of treason against Peruvians after the help that peruvians gave to Argentina in the Malvinas War. Between 1995 and 2010, diplomatic relations between Argentina and Peru remained frozen at their lowest historical point. Although later the Government of Argentina ended up expressing its reparation to the Peruvian State for this action. While some Peruvian newspapers concluded that Cristina Fernández had complied with what was morally due to the claims of dignity in Peruvian society with those words, other newspapers considered that this had not been enough, coming to suspect a possible camouflaged anti-Peruvian conduct. Examples of such tendencies could be seen in the newspaper Correo, on whose cover the headline \"He did not ask for forgiveness\" would appear, later pointing out that \"Fernández was very cautious in his speech and only used the word \\'reparation\\' in allusion to the questioned sale of arms to Ecuador\". Another case was that of Peru 21, which considered that in reality the Argentine president \"almost asked for forgiveness\".Recent cases of anti-Peruvianism have been glimpsed in the year 2000, the magazine La Primera denounced a \"Silent Invasion\" of Peruvians and Bolivians, with a cover illustrating a dark-skinned man with a missing tooth (through Photoshop) to increase the ideological content of the note or in 2010 when the newspaper La Nación denounced an invasion of Bolivians, Peruvians and Paraguayans in Argentina, which unleashed a wave of xenophobic and racist comments from readers. Controversial statements with anti-Peruvian overtones in some political sectors of the country are also mentioned, such as those of Justicialist senator Miguel Ángel Pichetto, when mentioning that Peru transferred its security problems through the migration of its criminals to Argentina, reaching a generalization that the main towns in the country were taken by Peruvians and that Argentina incorporates all this hangover, the controversy became even greater when even the Government of Argentina agreed with those statements. He also went so far as to affirm that Argentina has become ill for giving a pardon to a deported Peruvian (for having sold drugs) and that second chances should not be given, as well as accusing Peruvians of being responsible for the crimes in the slums. and the drug trade among young people, although clarifying that he did not say it for all Peruvians. Later there was concern, in 2019, of Peruvian diplomats about Pichetto\\'s nomination for the Argentine vice presidency, due to having anti-Peruvian sentiments that could affect bilateral relations between the two countries. Later, in 2020, He declare that the Buenos Aires suburbs are the social adjustment of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and Venezuela. It is usually assumed that this xenophobia of Argentines towards Peruvians and other nationalities they have been scapegoats many times for a political discourse that prefers not to assume its own responsibility. Bolivia. Historically, relations between Peru and Bolivia have been cloudy and contradictory, with attempts at reunification and alliances between the two countries due to ethnic and cultural similarities, as well as a series of conflicts that have marked both populations, particularly the Battle of Ingavi, which is seen as the founding war of Bolivia and which has had an impact on the Bolivian imaginary a Peruvian-phobic tendency to see Peru as an expansionist nation that threatens its sovereignty and always opposes Bolivian interests, and a Peruvian reaction to dismiss to Bolivia as the rebel province of Alto Peru that must be annexed, which has generated discord between both peoples, deepened in the actions of their alliance in the War of the Pacific, where they have branded each other as traitors as the reason for their military defeat. All these historical actions have influenced the formation of the national identity in Bolivia with anti-Peruvian overtones.. Anti-Peruvian actions in Bolivia can be traced from the beginning of its creation as a country, in 1826 the Bolivians tried to appropriate Arica, Tacna and Tarapacá, signing the sterile Pact of Chuquisaca with a plenipotentiary of Gran Colombia to negotiate limits and the federation of Peru with Charcas, justifying itself in its historical, economic and geographical affinity and stability, since many believed that the division of the \"two Perus\" was transitory because the great Andean state projected by the Liberator would soon be established. In Lima the problem was that the delivery of territories had to be immediate, but not the payment of the debt, which caused the chancellor José María Pando and the President of the Governing Board Andrés de Santa Cruz to reject the treaty. They make it clear that they would hand over Arica or Iquique but only for immediate benefits. As for the federative idea, what was agreed established a very weak executive and legislature that would only generate chaos and make them dependent on Gran Colombia to maintain order, denouncing an anti-Peruvianism of part of Simón Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre. Looking for alternatives, the Upper Peruvians sent the secret \"legislative legation\", a commission to ask Bolívar to suspend the decree of May 16, 1825 by which Arica was Peruvian, but they failed, since Bolívar did not want to provoke the people of Lima any more.There is also the anti-Peruvian belief that the War against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation was a Peruvian betrayal of Bolivia due to Bolivian nationalist hoaxes that the opposition of several Peruvians to the Union was motivated by being governed by a Bolivian (Andres de Santa Cruz), and that to avoid it, they ended up allying with Chile to achieve the fall of the confederation. In that same war there was opposition from Bolivians, especially in Chuquisaca to preserve their privileges, when mentioning that the confederate project favored Peru to the detriment of Bolivia by creating 2 Peruvian states (Republic of North Peru and Republic of South Peru) that would generate a disadvantage in decisions by having the Bolivian state 1 vote of 3 (there being a general opposition to what was agreed in the Tacna Congress), Bolivians were already discontent since Santa Cruz had settled in Lima, when he was expected to rule from Bolivian Republic, so he was accused of being a Peruvianphile. Therefore, both the Bolivian opposition to Santa Cruz, as well as the Bolivian defense of the confederation against Agustín Gamarra, was nourished by anti-Peruvianism.In addition, before, during and after the War of the Pacific, discourses emerged (especially in liberal groups) with anti-militarist, anti-oligarchic, anti-caudillo and anti-Peruvian tendencies, while antimilitarism was related to anti-Peruvianism. While the \"guerristas\" sought to continue the war and honour the alliance with Peru, the Bolivian conservatives or pacifists sought to achieve a peace agreement with Chile as soon as possible, even if to do so they had to rant against the Peruvians. Justiniano Sotomayor Guzmán\\'s proposal in his letters to Hilarión Daza that \"Bolivia has no better friend than Chile, nor worse executioner than Peru.\" Later, as Paz Soldán recalls, Bolivia (already an ally of Peru since 1873) tried to dispose of Arica and Pisagua, signing treaties with Brazil in 1878. There was also a Bolivian political sector with anti-Peruvian and pro-Chilean tendencies to change sides to the detriment of Peru in order to free itself from its influence in Bolivia\\'s internal politics, as well as to obtain Arica to compensate for its access to the sea. Later, during the Question of Tacna and Arica, there were anti-Peruvian feelings in Bolivia, because the Bolivian people felt they had a moral right to claim the territory of Arica as their natural outlet to the sea, in addition to considering Peru\\'s claims to recover Tacna and Arica (without giving Bolivia a port) was totally unacceptable and a betrayal of the Peruvian-Bolivian alliance; in the process, multiple insults were developed against the Peruvian community that lived in La Paz. This anti-Peruvian feeling was transferred to the foreign policy of the post-war country, for example, in 1895, Bolivia secret agreements with Chile, providing that Tacna and Arica would pass into the hands of Bolivia after the captivity. From 1902 they also secretly negotiated a peace without sea, until in the 1904 treaty they ceded their coastline to Chile in exchange for concessions and money (7 million pounds of gold), blocking the Peruvian recovery of Arica due to the construction of that railroad. port to La Paz with Chilean administration. In 1919, they even asked the League of Nations —via France— to appropriate Tacna and Arica.Is also mentioned the propaganda campaigns carried out by the Bolivian press with an anti-Peruvian tendency when it came to border demarcations during the 20th century, for which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru had to intervene to put pressure on the Bolivian Foreign Ministry in 1938 against tendentious articles that they made Bolivian newspapers in an attempt to challenge the Demarcation Protocol of the Province of Copacabana; Bolivian politicians were reportedly involved in this anti-Peruvian campaign, such as the Omasuyos deputy, Eguino Zaballa, who personally participated in the drafting of some articles on the alleged damages that Bolivia would suffer after the signing of the protocol with Peru.In February 1975, meeting in Charaña, Hugo Banzer and Augusto Pinochet issued a joint declaration that led to the Chilean proposal to give Bolivia a maritime corridor north of Arica, which was impossible while the 1929 Treaty was in force, according to the which Peru has restricted sovereignty and recognized easements over Arica, and must be consulted before any possible change in the sovereignty of the territory. It came to be suspected that this was the rapprochement of a possible anti-Peruvian axis between Chile and Bolivia against another potential military alliance between Peru and Argentina during the Cold War.. With the passage of time, the distinction between pro-Peruvians and pro-Chileans has largely disappeared. Chile now has both Arica and Antofagasta, so Bolivian popular anger is more often directed against Chile. However, the power of the media to scandalize people for an outlet to the sea for Bolivia has retained its vigor over the years, and various politicians in the country throughout history often use it to distract attention from other issues of Bolivian politics, even if it involves anti-Peruvian narratives. Given this, it is loose to brand that Bolivian politicians have had anti-Peruvian tendencies throughout history, such as: Andrés de Santa Cruz, who would have had apparent contradictions in his geopolitical projects, due to a highland nationalism, in which he wanted both the reunification of Upper and Lower Peru (in a similar way to the Inca Empire or the Viceroyalty of Peru) as well as to consider dividing Peru into 2 states, one from the north and the other from the south, for the benefit of Bolivia\\'s interests (in addition to recovering the territory of Arica for the benefit of Bolivia), which he envisioned as the \"Macedonia of America\" and which should have a leadership in the continent, to the detriment of the historical preponderance of Lima and Cuzco as poles of power.\"When he felt strong, his dreams of power were those of those legendary Incas who descended from the mountains to bring peace, order, and progress to the coast. Then he opened himself to the ideal of \\'pan-Peru\\', of Greater Peru. Bolivia would be the \"Macedonia of America\". If they beat and humiliated him and cornered him on the plateau, he wanted, not so much for revenge as for security reasons, next to Bolivia, a divided or impotent Peru. His maximum program was a strong Greater Peru and extensive, that is, the Confederation, with him as head. His minimum program was to govern Bolivia, but, at his side, the bifurcation of Peru into two states and the possible fall of the South State under Bolivia\\'s sphere of influence Such is the explanation of his political behavior until 1839. Since then the exclusive approach to Bolivia has been accentuated more and more in his life as an outlaw, and from the depth of his disappointment he has to look at Peru as an enemy country.\" Despite the defeat of the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation (where Santa Cruz and other foreign politicians proposed to Chile plans to divide Peru as a sudden measure, without success), Santa Cruz, Orbegoso and many other of their supporters (after being defeated in 1839) took refuge in Ecuador, who planned to organize expeditions to northern Peru, to undermine the Gamarra regime. Santa Cruz, who still held out hope of regaining power in Bolivia (where he still had supporters), continued to plot against Peru from Ecuador (contributing to increase the anti-peruvian sentiment in that country). Although it was unlikely that he would succeed in reconstituting the Confederation, Santa Cruz had a minimal plan: to annex southern Peru to Bolivia (and, if possible, weaken the northern Peruvian state in the face of an Ecuadorian territorial preponderance). From various letters preserved, it is known that his major plan was to promote an alliance between Ecuador and New Granada to attack Peru. It is therefore not by chance that at that time, Ecuador began its territorial demands towards Peru, claiming Tumbes, Jaén and Maynas. There is no doubt that those who incited Ecuador to make this claim were Santa Cruz and other enemies of the Peruvian government taking refuge in its territory. Since its birth as an independent state in 1830, Ecuador had not had a reason to complain against Peru for territorial reasons and they had even signed a friendship and alliance treaty in 1832, but it was only from 1841 when said nation refloated the old Bolivarian claim of Tumbes, Jaén and Maynas. As Minister Charún said in the negotiations of April 1842: \"The question of limits existed long before; however, Peru had not received a complaint from Ecuador; beginning to receive them since the enemies of Peru took refuge in that country\".. José Ballivián, after the War between Peru and Bolivia he executed an anti-Peruvian policy taking advantage of the post-war spirit, however, over time he became unpopular, even the congress refused to declare war again in 1847. Among the actions that executed his government, was to try to conspire against the government of Ramón Castilla, as well as to issue adulterated currency by Bolivia, \"el feble\", to the detriment of Peruvian merchants in the Altiplano (and benefiting Argentines), in addition to prohibiting exports from Peru. Also, with the help of the Peruvian José Felix Ugayn, he sought to develop a separatist project that sought to annex southern Peru to Bolivia (primarily Moquegua, Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá). Finally, Peruvian-Bolivian relations would stabilize with the Arequipa Treaty of November 1848.. Mariano Melgarejo, who during the arrangement of borders with Chile would have considered a proposal by Aniceto Vergara that harmed Peru by ceding its coastline to Chile in exchange for military aid to annex Tacna and Arica (at that time owned by Peru and coveted by Bolivia, because it was considered to its natural outlet for maritime trade since viceregal times), in addition to showing an incessant attitude of wanting to schism with Peru and the Treaty of Alliance. Julio Méndez points out Melgarejo\\'s anti-Peruvianism in his desire to break the treaty, blaming him for of \"Austrian intrigues of Chile\". In addition, the writer Carlos Walker Martínez, according to what he recounts in his work Páginas de Viaje, that it was too risky to oppose Melgarejo in a drunken state, in which it was recurring to hear his speech about wanting to go to war against the Peruvians and the wishes of reconquer the southern Peruvian territory that Ballivián returned to the Peruvian government after the war between the two countries in 1841.. Aniceto Arce, a member of the Liberal Party, who after assuming the Vice Presidency of Bolivia and from this position, would come to explicitly proclaim his adherence to the interests of the English capitalists, as well as his anti-Peruvian stance against the war. In a statement he would affirm that \"the only salvation table for Bolivia was that it put itself at the forefront of the Chilean conquests\". Manifesting, in addition, that Peru was \"a nation without blood, without probity and without sincere inclinations to the ally that had agreed to the alliance \"with the deliberate and sole purpose of ensuring its preponderance in the Pacific over Chile.\" Later, the famous writer from Santa Cruz, René Gabriel Moreno, would come out in defense of Arce for coincidences in his anti-Peruvian positions in Bolivian geopolitics. Referring to Campero, Moreno writes «Is it not well remembered that this man shouted War! War! While he was quietly contemplating the war efforts of his ally Peru?». Like Arce, Moreno is clearly opposed to any understanding or pact with Peru and maintains that Argentina, both the government and the people, were leaning in favor of Bolivia, repudiating, at the same time, Campero\\'s strange and provocative attitude.In Arce\\'s vision, Chile is presented as a vigorous country full of civic virtues that predicted its democratic culture, as well as a Great National Conscience, compared to Peru and Bolivia, weak and in the process of social disintegration due to their lack of modernity. Already in the middle of the War with Chile, Aniceto Arce warned, as the only prospect of peace, an explicit proximity to Chile, turning his back on Peru. The proposal meant breaking the allied front in exchange for the annexation of Tacna and Arica, it meant ultimately betraying the pact made with Peru. Undoubtedly, Aniceto Arce had strong common interests with the British financiers who maintained his headquarters in Chile. He was convinced that the development of Bolivia depended on the help that could be received from those capitalists. For its part, Chile had already seized the nitrate mines, thus rewarding the wishes of English capitalism. Now he saw in \"Peru his worst enemy, where the United States began to entrench itself in order to counteract the English expansion on the Pacific coast.\" Later, Arce would express his anti-Peruvian sentiment in 1873: \"As for the alliance that incessantly has been a very painful concern for me, I declare that I have never linked the slightest hope to it (...) Peru is a nation without blood, without probity and without sincere inclinations towards the ally.\" It must be assumed that Arce\\'s anti-Peruvianism revealed his affinity for English interests favorable to Chile within the foreign intervention in the Pacific War, since these were both his interests and he also believed they were fundamental to augur the progress of Bolivia through the implementation of free trade and the incorporation of the country into international capitalism. Other Chilean and anti-Peruvian public figures of the time would be Luis Salinas Vegas, Julio Méndez and Mariano Baptista (who was the most prominent supporter of Chilean interests against that of the Peruvians, harshly criticizing the project of the United States Peru-Bolivians).. Ismael Montes, Bolivian president (veteran of the War of the Pacific and the Acre War) who deeply disliked Peru, seeking to carry out a pro-Chilean Realpolitik, in which he sought, with the help of Chile, to intimidate Peru, exerting public pressure, and thus achieve the transfer of sovereignty of Tacna and Arica to Bolivia. This was because he considered that Bolivia\\'s natural geopolitics required obtaining access to the sea through the port of Arica, which was its natural outlet for geographical reasons. Montes sought to reverse the opinion that Bolivians had of their neighboring countries of \"Peru good and brother, Chile bad and Cain of America\", even if that could generate unreal and ephemeral perceptions. He came to abort integrationist policies of the previous government of José Gutiérrez Guerra (cancelling the promotion of exchange trips between students from both countries), he also developed incidents that agitated public opinion against Peru.   After his government ended (although he was still leader of the ruling political party), he supported the Bolivian attempts in 1920 to seek to sue Peru before the League of Nations, through France (being Bolivia\\'s ambassador in that country), to try to obtain the provinces of Arica and Tacna by any means. He later led attacks, with the help of Bolivian government officials, against the Peruvian Legation and its Consulates, as well as Peruvian residents and their property, in La Paz. He even tried, through Darío Gutiérrez (his deputy as ambassador in Paris) to accuse the Peruvian Foreign Ministry of being the true instigator of the incidents.. Evo Morales, who has had an ambiguous position with the Peruvians during his government, going from promoting a highland brotherhood between both peoples of an indigenous nature, to having positions against Peru due to ideological differences, where relations almost broke during the government of Alan García for his meddling in the internal affairs of Peru, where the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru, José Antonio García Belaúnde, accused him of having anti-Peruvian positions even before he was president of Bolivia and of that there is an attempt by Evo to make a historical revisionism to blame Peru for Bolivia\\'s problems, such as its condition as a landlocked country, these strategies of Morales would have sought to replace the anti-Chilean discourse of the outlet to the sea , referring to the use of nationalism for populist purposes of internal politics (since many of these actions were prior to elections that determined their political future). Morales even threatened to denounce Peru before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, because the Peruvian government granted diplomatic asylum to three former ministers of former President Sánchez de Losada, whom Morales described as \"criminals\", which he later It provoked anti-Peruvian marches in the city of El Alto by leftist movements and sindicalist, who threatened to expel all Peruvian citizens from the country and vandalize the Peruvian consulate if the former ministers\\' asylum is not revoked. On the other hand, Morales also accused Peru of wanting to \"appropriate\" the \"cultural expressions\" of Bolivia, to the point that the Bolivian Minister of Culture, Pablo Groux, threatened to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague because they postulate that the diablada is native to Bolivia and not to Peru. In the following 5 years there were approximately ten complaints of appropriation of Bolivian folklore. The issue came to touch the national pride of both countries and fueled an anti-Peruvian position in several Bolivian nationalists opposed proposals to consider them bi-national.   In addition, Evo went so far as to affirm that the demand of Peru in The Hague against Chile, due to the maritime delimitation controversy between the two countries, had the objective of blocking Bolivian aspirations for an outlet to the sea (through a corridor on the land border between Peru and Chile), stating that he had information in which the Peruvian Government “knows that the lawsuit is going to lose it. They know it: they made the lawsuit to harm Bolivia.\" All this set of actions meant that the Peruvian Foreign Ministry had to deliver ten protest notes to its counterpart in Bolivia, since Morales does not respect the rules of conduct that must govern between heads of state. Subsequently, some nationalist sectors in Peru denounced Evo for having claims to carry out a geopolitical project that seeks control of copper, lithium and uranium, as well as an outlet to the sea for Bolivia, to the detriment of Peru. Also, the action of the members from his political party (Movimiento al Socialismo), like the actual presidente of Bolivia (Luis Arce) prompted a formal \"vigorous protest\" by the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, which accused the Bolivian government of \"interference\" in Peru\\'s internal affairs, specially during the end of Pedro Castillo government.. Currently, in camba nationalist groups in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (like Movimiento Nación Camba de Liberación), there has been an opposite vision to what they accuse of colla domination of Bolivia, and in favor of a secession from the Camba homeland or at least greater autonomy of eastern Bolivia within the State. For this reason, they try to distance themselves from the concept of Upper Peru (interpreted as something purely Andean) and that they associate as belonging to the Collas, accused them of realize an \"Upper-Peruvian neocolonialism\" in Bolivia, which has promoted indirectly an anti-Peruvianism within the most radical sectors, due to the similar ethnic composition between southern Peru and western Bolivia due to their common altiplano-historical past.. In addition, a very particular anti-Peruvian xenophobic sentiment had been developed in Bolivia (motivated more for reasons of citizen security than for reasons of job offers), for which Peruvians have been accused of \"importing advanced techniques to commit crimes\" and of always generating a increase in crime in the regions where they settle, the belief being widespread that almost every Peruvian is a potential criminal. That anti-Peruvian climate was pointed out by Catholic priests such as Father Julián Suazo. It has been suspected that the Bolivian police themselves have a responsibility in promoting anti-Peruvian xenophobia, trying to blame Peruvians for the increase in crime (in instead of Bolivia\\'s internal problems), as well as not efficiently preserving the human rights of Peruvian migrants in the face of outrages. For example, Colonel Javier Gómez Bustillos of the Bolivian Police (markedly anti-Peruvian) would have carried out attacks to Peruvian citizens in May 2001, and despite this, he continued to receive the protection of his government and his institution, who would have promoted him to the best positions in his institution instead of making him answer to the law. The Bolivian press and The media would have helped the development of this current of anti-Peruvian opinion, getting it to position itself in the Bolivian masses, by giving great emphasis in its programs to criminal acts carried out by Peruvian migrants, including the most serious crimes such as drug trafficking and those related to subversion. The death of a Peruvian soldier, the sailor Juan Vega Llana, also contributed to the latter, due to the fact that he was assassinated, in a central street of La Paz, by Peruvian people (classified as subversive) who were members of the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, who They sought revenge for the Massacre in the prisons of Peru. These fears of subversive Peruvians were also fueled by the widely publicized kidnapping, together with the collection of a ransom of 1,000,000 dollars, of the Bolivian businessman and politician Samuel Doria Medina; a fact that was carried out by Peruvians (also classified as subversives) members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). All of which were events that generated a very bad reputation for Peruvians among Bolivian society, being incited by said prejudices and stereotypes by the morbidity of the press. Despite everything, Bolivian institutions report that, in the prison population of In that country, it is not a reality that the number of Peruvian prisoners is proportionally greater than the Bolivian citizens sentenced to prison.. The Commission for Human Rights and Pacification of the Congress of the Republic of Peru has come to examine multiple cases of aggressions and mistreatment in Bolivia, against Peruvian citizens, including Congresswoman Susana Díaz, after a trip to Bolivia, verified the excesses committed against Peruvian groups , coming to denounce that there is an \"anti-Peruvian phobia\", especially in the Desaguadero. Chile. In Chile, there is a history of an unfriendly policy with Peru since the commercial rivalry between Callao and Valparaíso during colonial times, beginning a geopolitical project after its independence, the \"Doctrina Portales\" (formulated mainly by Diego Portales), being the Chilean most iconic anti-peruvian policy, a geopolitical formula that influenced a lot in chilean nationalism and Armed Forces Intellectuals. Is based that, in order to consolidate itself as a great power in the Pacific, Chile must oppose to the development of Peru, based on the danger that this country represented for the sovereignty and development of Chile and South America.. “(...) Chile\\'s position towards the Peru-Bolivian Confederation is untenable. It cannot be tolerated either by the people or by the Government because it is tantamount to their suicide. We cannot look without concern and the greatest alarm, the existence of two peoples, and that, in the long run, due to the community of origin, language, habits, religion, ideas, customs, will form, as is natural, a single nucleus. United these two States, even if it is only momentarily, will always be more than Chile in every order of issues and circumstances (...) The confederation must disappear forever and ever from the American scene due to its geographical extension; for its larger white population; for the joint riches of Peru and Bolivia, scarcely exploited now; for the dominance that the new organization would try to exercise in the Pacific by taking it away from us; by the greater number of enlightened white people, closely linked to the families of Spanish influence that are in Lima; for the greater intelligence of its public men, although of less character than the Chileans; For all these reasons, the Confederation would drown Chile before very soon (...) The naval forces must operate before the military, delivering decisive blows. We must dominate forever in the Pacific: this must be their maxim now, and hopefully it would be Chile\\'s forever (...)”.. So, to position Chile as the leader of the South Pacific, and for this, a cautious policy had to be followed regarding the hegemony of other competitors in its area of influence, such as Spain (which led to the Liberating Expedition of Peru and the Chincha Islands War) or Peru (which led to several conflicts such as the War against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the War of the Pacific). It should also be mentioned that the battalions of Chilean origin became infamous for the acts of looting and excesses that they caused Peruvians during the war of independence, becoming notable for all kinds of crimes.There are indications that this Chilean geopolitical formula of having Upper Peru divided from Lower Peru would have already been glimpsed even before Diego Portales made it official as a norm of the Chilean State. For example, the Chilean diplomat, Don Manuel Egaña, wrote then, regarding the founding of the Republic of Bolívar:. Hence, for the security and prosperity of Chile, the separation of Alto Peru is absolutely convenient, both from the Provinces of the Río de la Plata and from the former Viceroyalty of Lima, and that by forming an independent State it provides us with these two advantages:. 1° decrease the preponderance of each of those States, and 2° being the center (Bolivia) weakened by the forces of both (Argentina and Peru)\".. The first indications of this policy for the domain of the South Pacific occurred in the Conquest of Chiloé. After the first Chilean attempt to annex the archipelago failed, Simón Bolívar (Peru\\'s dictator at the time), eager to curry favor with the Peruvian elite, began to consider sending an expedition to bring it under the sovereignty of Lima, based on the uti possidetis iuris (because Chiloé was under the direct administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and then, to this republic corresponded the territory), before Spain negotiated and ceded the island potentially to the United Kingdom or France, powers that were knew they were interested in that territory, or the Chilotas attempted an expedition to some region of the South Pacific. For the Chilean government, having Bolivarian troops to the south and north (in 1825, after the occupation of Upper Peru, the forces of Bolívar went on to seize all the territory north of the Loa) was considered a threat to their sovereignty. For the same reason, Bolívar\\'s offer to form a joint expedition that would include 2,000 Colombian soldiers was rejected. Finally , the ruler of Colombia and Peru would demand that the Freire government end the threat that royalist Chiloé posed to South America or annex it to Peru (Bolivar was willing to renounce Peruvian claims to the territory in order to avoid strengthening Peru economically). Meanwhile, a Chilean squadron set sail on November 15, 1824 to help in the blockade of Callao, commanded by Vice Admiral Blanco Encalada, who had learned of the intentions of Bolívar and other Lima authorities to annex the southern archipelago due to their old ties. with Peru, when he landed with his fleet in Quilca on January 6, 1825, so in June he decided to return to Valparaíso with the Chilean fleet to report that the island should be conquered as soon as possible, even if that was to the detriment of the interests Peruvians. Later, the Portales doctrine would be applied when Chile intervened in the War of the Confederation on the side of the United Restoration Army. However, from the beginning the Chilean press clarified that the war was against Andres de Santa Cruz and not against Peru, therefore, this anti-Peruvianism is particularly associated with the War of the Pacific, a war between Chile and the Peruvian-Bolivian alliance, which began in 1879 and culminated in the loss of Bolivia\\'s access to the sea and the Peruvian territories of the province of Arica and the department of Tarapacá in favor of Chile. In addition, during the Occupation of Lima, there were plans to disappear Peru as a state, under the formula of Annexation or anarchy, which tried to base itself on anti-Peruvian brains, accusing Peru of being a country populated by an inferior race of \"rebels by profession.\", being an idle, effeminate, cowardly and anarchic people, which is therefore incapable of governing itself; while the solution to Peruvian instability was to annex the Chilean nation, made up of a privileged, progressive and civilizing race, of European extraction. Having consequently an extremely anti-Peruvian policy during the occupation of Tacna, where there were several aggressive altercations with the native population in the Chileanization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá. At that time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile was assumed by Mr. Agustín Edwards Mac Clure, a person with marked anti-Peruvian sentiments, who from the beginning of his administration came to intensify Chile\\'s \"strong hand\" policy in Tacna and Arica, renewing the Peruvian protests.The anti-Peruvian riots and attacks, as well as their anti-Chilean counterparts, constantly harassed the diplomatic missions of the countries, which is why several cities in Chile began to rearticulate the patriotic leagues, nationalist organizations responsible for much of the xenophobic violence that was unleashed against Peruvians and Bolivians residing in the country in the country that had annexed the provinces where they lived. According to Arnold McKay, former US consul in Antofagasta, Chile activated three strategies to achieve that objective. He founded Ligas Patrioticas, clandestine organizations inspired by the Ku Klux Klan, which expelled prosperous and influential Peruvians and Bolivians. He maintained strict censorship of Peruvian newspapers. Since 1918, he prescribed the appearance of resident or passing foreigners to register their fingerprints and show their nationality cards to the police. This measure arose to exclude extremists from the country, but in fact it served to find out how many Peruvians and Bolivians were in the area. From 1918 to 1922, the Chilean State and population were exposed to a real and fictitious “danger from the North”. The nationalist feeling of the leagues was mainly marked by a fundamental anti-Peruvianism. The journalist and diplomat José Rodríguez Elizondo maintained that from that moment on, a relationship with Peru was consolidated in Chile, inspired by mistrust and prejudice, where the Chileanization carried out by the Patriotic Leagues would be the definitive establishment of mass nationalism, almost Chilean chauvinism, which \"led to exalt xenophobic features, fundamentally anti-Peruvian\". It is important to note that this perspective, with its nuances, became accessible to many sectors beyond Tarapacá, such as the embarrassing event of Don Ladislao\\'s War, in which accuse of \"sold out Peruvian gold\" anyone who questioned the action of Minister of War, Ladislao Errázuriz, of mobilizing troops from Santiago to the north, in a farce to attack a fictitious Peruvian enemy, while in reality he wanted the army away from the capital (due to its proximity to the candidate Arturo Alessandri Palma). In addition, innumerable newspapers, starting with the newspapers and magazines of the mainstream press (El Mercurio, El Diario Ilustrado, El Chileno, Zig-Zag and Sucesos), shared a similar idea of the conception of the homeland. In Congress, this thought full of Peruvian-phobic prejudices was personified by the Balmacedista deputy, Anselmo Blanlot, who would end up propagating the idea that the anti-Peruvian violence in the north was truly \"imaginary attacks.\" Peru was seen as barbarism and Chile, it was supposed, light and civilization. Other politicians with anti-Peruvian tendencies were Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure, Víctor Eastman Cox or Rafael Edwards Salas. Later, in the 1970s, there was a high possibility of conflict between Chile and Peru, between Chile and Argentina, and between Peru and Ecuador, which were feared that they would become entangled in a war on a continental scale. During the government of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, there were tensions between the two countries, due not only to the geopolitical rivalry in the South Pacific and the nationalist sentiments of both countries, but also due to certain ideological differences between the right-wing Pinochet regime and the leftist regime of the Peruvian dictator, Juan Velasco Alvarado, in the framework of the Cold War, to whom the Chilean military leadership attributed a determined military will to recover the provinces of Arica and Tarapacá before the centenary of the War of the Pacific, even before the Coup de State against Allende. There is a record of at least 2 occasions in which Pinochet came to seriously consider the idea of starting a preventive war against Peru. In 1974, Pinochet summoned the General Staff of the National Defense of Chile to analyze the possibility of attempting a massive military attack on Peru (preventing the Peruvians from attacking first), however, he only obtained the support of the Army, but not that of the Navy or Air Force, whose officers feared the Peruvian military superiority of back then. There were attempts to achieve friendly rapprochement between the Chilean regime and the Bolivian dictatorship of Hugo Banzer Suárez, to find a solution to Bolivia\\'s landlocked nature, in order to ensure its neutrality, or even win its support from this country, in case there was a war against Peru. Through the Charaña Agreement, signed on February 8, 1975, both countries reestablished their diplomatic relations, interrupted since 1962. However, the agreement failed to advance due to additional demands from Peru , now under the command of the dictator Francisco Morales Bermúdez, since its territorial interests of Peru were intentionally violated. Instead of this agreement in its original version, Peru proposed that the territory be administered simultaneously by the three countries, however, both Chile and Bolivia refused to accept this complicated agreement, so Banzer again decided to break relations with Chile on March 17, 1978. On another occasion, the Peruvian Intelligence service obtained information that the Pinochet government was preparing a threat of war with Peru, as a way to end the internal problems of his regime. In 1976, the possibility of launching a preventive war against Peru was even evaluated, according to a dialogue he held that year with the then US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, during the meeting of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in Chile during that year. However, Kissinger made it clear that the position of the United States would depend on who started the conflict. But, he assured that the United States would oppose Peru if it had Cuban support, however, that remained in the speculative. Meanwhile, Pinochet carried out border mining in order to prevent an invasion; For this, some 180,000 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines were installed on all the borders of Chile between 1975 and 1990, in addition to promoting the development of chemical weapons to use them against the Peruvian army. On the other hand, the Ecuadorian military, which had received material support from Pinochet (now as senator for life in Chile) during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, they honored him with a series of decorations.In addition, some historiographical currents of Chilean origin, have fallen into some anti-Peruvian biases when analyzing historical events of continental and South American impact, for example, the works of the Chilean Gonzalo Bulnes: Historia de la expedición libertadora del Perú (1817-1822), and Bolívar en el Perú: Últimas campañas de la independencia del Perú, are described by Raúl Porras Barrenechea as \"anti-Peruvian\" for tending to emphasize foreign intervention in the Independence of Peru and belittling Peruvian perspectives about the event. Also, through the analysis of Chilean history school textbooks in 2010, Parodi proposed a model to understand how the relations between Chile with Peru and Bolivia are perceived in national education, by which Chile assumes the subordinate role and Peru and Bolivia, the role of subordinate nations. Chile\\'s self-perception is characterized by attributions of: civilization, economic development, political order, successful national project and ethnic homogeneity with a predominance of white-western. On the contrary, the perception of Peru-Bolivia includes the attributions of barbarism, economic underdevelopment, political chaos, failed national projects, predominance of the indigenous and ethnic heterogeneity. This would imply in Chile an ethnocentric and unfavorable attitude towards the outgroup made up of Peru and Bolivia. Examples of this would be the historical narratives of the Chilean politician and orator, Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, who spread the civilizing discourse that tried to justify the violence committed in the War of the Pacific and contaminated with anti-Peruvian sentiment. It is also known that there has been a tendency among Chilean essayists and historians to condemn the pro-Peruvian Americanists in the Spanish-South American War, accused of having been naive politicians who they were detrimental to national interests, when a pragmatic attitude should have been taken and not meddle in the Peruvian conflict of the Chincha islands due to an unrequited idealism by all the American nations (which would even isolate Chile, like the countries of the Triple Alliance). An example of this anti-Peruvian current with this historical episode is the work of Francisco Antonio Encina in his book Historia de Chile (1938-52), which has been seriously criticized by historians in the academic environment for a lack of scientific rigor. Oscar Espinosa Moraga, his disciple, would have spread and developed this anti-Americanist current, becoming the most widespread opinion among the population.According to the Chilean intellectual José Rodríguez Elizondo, \"what there is in my country is a great ignorance about Peruvian culture that, in addition, reinforces the prejudices that are at the base of chauvinism.\" In addition to political issues, there are historical disputes in the cultural field, such as the origin of pisco, a grape brandy, which each nation recognizes as its own. The second government of Michelle Bachelet was described as taking an anti-Peruvian position in the terrestrial triangle controversy to distract the Chilean public opinion of the Caval case where relatives of Bachelet are being investigated.It has also been affirmed that during the Peruvian Immigration in Chile there has been a small Peruvian-phobic attitude on the part of the Chilean population. This is evidenced by means of exploratory investigations of an anti-Peruvian discourse in the dimension of Chilean daily life, for which they presented samples of anti-Peruvian discourse of urban circulation (such as graffiti and photographs) and cybernetics (such as some exchanges taken from Internet sites); expressing representations of anti-Peruvianism in the dimensions in relation to the level of development, culture and physical appearance. Regarding the evaluation of the mutual images that are presented in Peruvian and Chilean blogs on the Internet, multiple manifestations of strong hostility, which contribute to support the validity of the expansionism-revanchism dynamic in the mutual images between Chile and Peru. Ecuador. In Ecuador, anti-Peruvian sentiment is mainly related to irredentism due to the Gran Colombia–Peru War and the border conflict between the two countries. According to former ambassador Eduardo Ponce Vivanco, the violent anti-Peruvianism cultivated in Ecuador is comparable to the anti-Chileanism that subsists in a minority in Peru. The Ecuadorian government came to describe Peru as the \"Cain of the Americas\" due to its border disputes, in the first years after the signing of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol on 29 January  1942, a treaty that established the borders; in the Ecuadorian streets, phrases such as \"Peruvian imperialism\" were read. The governments of José María Velasco Ibarra, León Febres Cordero and Jaime Roldós Aguilera had an openly anti-Peruvian position.. \"The signing of the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro in January 1942 was processed in the consciousness of the urban masses -strictu sensu-, not only as a historical fact of territorial confinement, but as a psychic and physical mutilation also assumed in individual terms. The painful saying that for decades has been repeated in school classrooms would already say: \"Yellow, blue and red: the flag of the patojo.\" From 1941, being Ecuadorian would imply being handicapped and a loser, which will deepen the identity conflict of the Ecuadorian mestizo: if before he was incomplete, imperfect or chulla because he fled from his roots, now he was incomplete or patojo because he was facing reality.\". In addition, Peruvian historians, such as Germán Leguía and Martínez, have accused Ecuadorian historians of a well-documented and marked anti-Peruvianism when trying to minimize the role of the pro-Peruvian party in Guayaquil, headed by Gregorio Escobedo, during the Independence of Ecuador. Between Them would be included Pio Jaramillo Alvarado, Óscar Efrén Reyes (who would criticize the Peruvians of Saraguro, Cuenca, Loja and Guayaquil, provinces with populations that sought to annex Peru at the beginning of the 21st century, as hindrances to the national unification of Ecuador in Gran Colombia of Bolívar) and Pedro Fermín Cevallos. A certain tendency of the press of the time to fall into anti-Peruvian positions has also been documented, as an example are newspapers that satire and mock the monarchist doctrines of the Royal Army of Peru while justifying the arbitrary annexation of Guayaquil, another case are the newspapers Ecuadorians who belittled the death of the Peruvian caudillo José de La Mar compared to that of the Venezuelan Simon Bolívar.Ecuador\\'s territorial conflicts with Peru date back to the first days of independence, since the construction of the borders of the states through respect for the principle of Uti Possidetis Jure, that is, the borders imposed by the colonial administration on their respective legal-administrative entities (viceroyalties), had the problem of ambiguity for this area for the year 1810 and the existence of a royal decree of the year 1802 transferring these territories from Quito to Peru; Given this, they agreed to submit the matter to the arbitration of the King of Spain (even tripartite proposals with Colombia were considered).. During the Peruvian-Ecuadorian War of 1858-1860, the figure of Gabriel García Moreno was accused of promoting, in his conception of Ecuadorian patriotism, anti-Peruvianism, Catholic fanaticism and rancor towards the soldiery. The development of a certain Ecuadorian anti-Peruvianism, something clearly known in Chile and in Peru itself, prompted Chile, through the diplomat Joaquín Godoy, to try to open a \"second front\" to Peru in the War of the Pacific. The deep political-social divisions, as well as those between Guayaquil and Quito, prevented such an alliance from materializing (due to pro-Peruvian tendencies in Guayaquil society), however, it helped to crystallize the idea of an anti-Peruvian axis of Chile-Ecuador.At the dawn of the 20th century the situation was explosive. In June 1903, an armed conflict had already occurred between Ecuadorian and Peruvian troops in Angoteros, in the Napo River region. At the beginning of 1904, Ecuador was interested in making a common front against Peru. According to the Peruvian historian Jorge Basadre, the Ecuadorian plenipotentiary in Rio de Janeiro would have proposed that the Brazilian baron of Rio Branco accept the cession of part of the territory that his country disputed to Peru so that Brazil could obtain an exit to the Pacific, the cession was mainly considered from Tumbes. Naturally, such territorial expansion could only be obtained by a war that, in truth, was not in the Baron\\'s plans. The crucial point for him was just to guarantee possession of Acre without making new concessions to Peru.After the arbitration award of the King of Spain, who at that time was the Bourbon Alfonso XIII, faced with the prospect of a war between Peru and Ecuador, which would have caused the ruling, refrained from the Peruvian-Ecuadorian tension of 1910. The violent anti-Peruvian demonstrations in Ecuador and anti-Ecuadorian demonstrations in Peru, the mobilization of forces in both countries, everything made us hope that the armed conflict would break out in 1910, had it not been for the intervention of the United States, Brazil and Argentina. The hostilities between the two do not cease, which leads Ecuador in 1910 to establish a defensive alliance with Colombia, giving it 180,000 km2 of the Amazon area for payment, in exchange for strengthening a possible anti-Peruvian alliance between the two. A gesture that Colombia would betray in the eyes of Ecuador by ceding in 1922 to Peru, the common enemy, half of the territories ceded by it.. In the middle of the 20th century, the degree of hostility would have increased to the point of a first armed confrontation in 1941, prompted by a seizure of Peruvian Amazonian territories at the hands of the Ecuadorian army, particularly the rubber zone. During the 2nd Peruvian-Ecuadorian War, the Porotillo Massacre broke out, whereby the Peruvian platoon, commanded by Alfredo Novoa Cava, was massacred in Cune by Ecuadorian troops on September 11, 1941, leaving only one survivor (the captain\\'s nephew); This event, carried out in full truce, filled the Ecuadorian chiefs and officers with pride due to strong anti-Peruvian feelings, but not all the soldiers that made up the Ecuadorian detachment, who felt terrified by the fact that their superiors celebrated as one \" victoria\" a crime against humanity. In addition, a violent anti-Peruvian campaign developed in the Ecuadorian press, newspapers and radio broadcasters became very contemptuous and very hostile street demonstrations against Peruvians were encouraged, attacking the Peruvian Consulate in Guayaquil. The way of carrying out this action by Ecuador, in numerical inferiority and with a fleet of weapons, quickly resolved the conflict in favor of Peru with serious consequences in terms of building national identity. The ruling classes and \"owners\" of Ecuador worked to generate awareness in the masses about the act of aggression for which it fell equally on the government and on the people; what would be in the words of Cairo: \"territorialist indoctrination of populations\", based on borders that did not respond to legal reality. During the 1950s, this preaching would be reinforced and thus became a State policy that, in a certain way, unified the consciences and the national soul of Ecuadorians in an anti-Peruvian feeling for an imaginary territorial integrity. Ecuador and its people only had to take refuge in a doubtful border line of an equally doubtful Pedemonte-Mosquera Protocol of 1829. This negative awareness was included in basic education textbooks, reaching the point of locating its roots in the clash between Huáscar and Atahualpa, justification for which anti-Peruvianism acquired a historical rationality. In accordance with the above, the hegemonic meaning of national construction in Ecuador has been permanently related to the obsession with territorial integrity derived from the wars with the Peru. Anti-Peruvianism, expression of the existence of the other, would be an essential component element of what some have called \"Ecuadorianness\", generating biased interpretations about the times of the expansion of the Inca Empire, currently considered, like Spain. imperial, as imperialist invaders that attacked the essence of being Ecuadorian and that frustrated the Kingdom of Quito, through the interference of its neighbor to the south (whether as Incas or as a Peruvian viceroyalty) in the historical development of the construction of the nation. The military forces, pressured by the conflict with Peru, have developed their own defense and national security doctrine. The notions of sovereignty, integrity and national unity have been a hard core in the military imaginary that would ideologically influence the white and mestizo elite of the modern Ecuadorian nation-state. After the Cenepa War and the signing of a definitive peace, it has been claimed that the Ecuadorian State has a duty to change the teaching of the history of its country, eliminating from school textbooks the multiple elements of anti-Peruvianism that have been taught for decades. future generations of the country, putting an end to the falsehoods that distorted the Ecuadorian national consciousness, in order to improve Ecuador-Peru Relations.The vision of Ecuadorians about Peruvians was analyzed by Durán Barba in 1992. The results obtained, from a national sample, showed that the majority of those surveyed considered that Ecuadorians are more intelligent, hard-working, courageous, prepared and honest; as well as less violent and false than the Peruvians. Most of those questioned denounced a bias of preferring to trade with people from Colombia than with those from Peru. Those prejudiced against Peru were proportionally more numerous in citizens older than 53 years, and minors in those between the ages of 18 and 27, as well as in the lowest social strata, including the educational level without access to primary education provided by the Ecuadorian State. The intensity of anti-Peruvian prejudice was lower in the better informed groups, and higher in those with less information about Peru. In short, 74% of those surveyed showed aversion towards Peru. In addition, regarding the image of Peru in Ecuadorian education textbooks, these were later analyzed by Malpica and González in 1997, whose analysis evidences the psychosocial facet regarding derogatory judgments and adjectives against Peru in school textbooks, under the form of epithets that point to Peruvians as the cause of all Ecuadorian ills, and showing themselves as the \"enemy to be eliminated.\" Concluding that a \"victimization\" of Ecuador is taught based on the accusation against the Peruvian state of an expansionist will against Ecuador, as well as attributing to Peruvians a series of denigrating stereotypes that foster resentment towards Peruvians and a \"desire to revenge”. Proof of all this was given by the President of the Ecuadorian Congress, Samuel Belletini, who came to declare on August 24, 1993 that his anti-Peruvian sentiments were the product of the education received, that he could not change them and that he ratified in them. It was also accused, by Peruvian diplomacy, that Ecuadorian politicians incited an anti-Peruvian warmongering policy to win easy votes.This anti-peruvian sentiments trough history in ecuadorian nationalism were sintetyzed by the words of Paco Moncayo (ecuadorian politician and militar):. \"In a country devoid of national consciousness since its very foundation in 1830, and torn by intense regionalism and the rivalry between the cities of Quito –capital city–, and Guayaquil –economic nucleus of the nation–, anti-Peruvianism became the only pole of attraction capable of uniting all Ecuadorians, although in Peru a general feeling of anti-Ecuadorianism perhaps never took root –with the exception of Iquitos and the northeastern regions bordering Ecuador, paradoxically the same territories over which the Ecuador insisted on claiming as its own\" Venezuela. Bolivarian Chavismo and its supporters have declared their contempt for the Peruvian government for, according to then-Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez in 2017, supporting \"Venezuela\\'s intervention in the world\" due to the creation of the Lima Group. It has also been increased by the Venezuelan authorities, such as President Nicolás Maduro describing Peru as having an \"imperialist mentality\" and \"lifelong anti-Bolivarian\" for not being invited to the VIII Summit of the Americas held in Lima due to the crisis in Venezuela.Likewise, during the Peruvian Immigration in Venezuela, many Peruvians, as well as Ecuadorians and Colombians, were subjected to discrimination and xenophobia by the Venezuelan socialist government, who used the adjectives \"Indian\" and \"guajiro\" to refer to immigrants from these countries.. Anti-Peruvianism has also intensified in the Venezuelan population, which has a negative perspective against Peruvians due to accusations of xenophobia during Venezuelan Immigration in Peru, and which has generated a belief that Peruvians have been ungrateful to Venezuela after welcome them during the Peruvian exodus from the time of terrorism. Many anti-Peruvian prejudices and stereotypes have also been shown among Venezuelans, where they accuse Peruvians of being ugly people and the face of Indians, affirming that their migrants come to \"improve the race\".It is also often accused that figures of the Venezuelan government have had anti-Peruvian tendencies, and some historical figures of the colonial era, being some such as: Simón Bolívar, who during his dictatorship in Peru would have wanted to perpetuate himself in power against the Peruvian will through the Lifetime Constitution, in turn carried out repression against several Peruvian politicians to favor his personal project of the Federation of the Andes, In addition to being accused of having written a Peruvian-phobic letter to Santander on January 7, 1824 (in Pativilca), where he referred to Peruvians and Quito people as Indians (in a derogatory way) and inferior to the Venezuelans.\"I think I have told you, before now, that the Quitos are the worst Colombians. The fact is that I have always thought so. The Venezuelans are saints compared to those evil ones. The Quitos and the Peruvians are the same thing: vicious to the point of infamy and base to the extreme. The whites have the character of the Indians, and the Indians are all truchimanes, all thieves, all liars, all false, without any moral principle to guide them. Guayaquileños are a thousand times get better\" It is also denounced that he used to constantly insult Peruvians in private letters, accusing them of barbaric people for their lack of affection for republican ideas, in addition to admitting that he used to give false compliments to Peruvian politicians, in order to manipulate them so that they do not interfere with his Bolivian Federation project (in the largest project of the Great Homeland), as well as showing indifference to Corruption in Peru, or even encouraging it among the caudillos in order to weaken Peru (even seeking its total disarmament under the pretext financial insufficiency):\"(...) The Empire [Federation of the Andes] will come true, or there will be a deluge of blood in America: therefore I entrust you with energy and perseverance. What do you have to fear from the imbeciles of Peru? Don\\'t you already have the consent of Gamarra and La-Fuente? Aren\\'t our friends the owners of the council of that cabinet, don\\'t they have a majority in lodge 5, aren\\'t they protected by our squad, and guaranteed by my power? Leave me alone with the plainsman Paez, and with these doctors from Bogotá; working well over there, I answer for the event. Meanwhile, that government destroys the liberals under the guise of anarchists. (...) When you see those pusillanimous Gamarra and La-Fuente look pale before the anarchists, ask them to take their cockade for a few days: when they fear too much, authorize them to take a million dollars divisibly from the Peruvian funds. pesos that I\\'m sure will take making you conceive, which is a good viaticum for an escape.The central idea to threaten them, is the empire, and its immovability. Flatter Gamarra, telling him that he gets the best Duchy, for being the richest, the most civilized, and the most extensive from Santa to the Apurimac: there cannot be a better division. Besides, to La-Fuente, U. says the same thing with respect to his Duchy from Apurimac to Desaguadero; and keep between them, and Eléspuru continuous jealousy. With that seductive idea of perpetuity in their destinies, free from the oscillations of anarchy, we have destroyed that weapon of territorial integrity that would make them work with disgust. Entertained in this way, they will not know the double intention of adding the Duchy of northern Peru to Colombia; although the empire must be one and indivisible (...) Let your main care be that you disarm the Peruvian Force, and the civic, the veteran and the squad. To carry it out, there is the ostensible pretext of the celebrated peace, and of the ruin that the treasury of Peru would experience from the maintenance of an unnecessary army. You know the need to employ people addicted to me in destinations; so you intervene for them together with that government. It is unnecessary to warn you not to allow the accession of any other, who is not a good Colombian, near Gamarra and La-Fuente, because it could happen that they would open their eyes about their political situation, and in truth, that if in that If there were a conversion of political ideas in the cabinet or currently a mutation of the government, everything would be lost. And what would our luck then be?\"On the other hand, it has been pointed out that Bolívar, before his arrival in Peru, would have been conspiring against the Protectorate of San Martín, through Venezuelan agents such as Tomás de Heres (who participated in an attempted rebellion against Don José de San Martín in October 1821, being deported to Guayaquil and returning to Peru as an important adviser and general of the armies of the Venezuelan liberator), as well as requesting troops from Santander (vice president of Colombia) to generate uprisings and Peruvian protests through spies and infiltrators against San Martin. In this context, it would seem that Bolívar aspired to displace San Martín in the role of consecrating the Independence of South America, and also, to plunge Peru into anarchy that would benefit the interests, both personal of Bolívar to want to stand out as the most important caudillo for guarantee the law and order of the independence process at the continental level, as geopolitical of Gran Colombia, to obtain leadership at the continental level (and thus more easily concretize the future project of the Great Homeland) at the cost of sacrificing the interests of the peruvians.\"(...) It is necessary to work so that nothing is established in the country (Peru) and the safest way is to divide them all. The measure adopted by Sucre names Torre Tagle, embarking Riva Agüero (...) It is excellent. It is necessary that there is not even a simulation of government and this is achieved by multiplying leaders and putting them in opposition. Upon my arrival, Peru must be a cleared field so that I can do what is convenient in it\".\"Of Peru I know nothing officially, and I hardly have a confused idea of its current situation, which, it seems, is the most regrettable. Its government is so infamous that it has not yet written a word to me; no doubt determined to do some infamy with that miserable town (...) and by going we can take advantage of all its resources\" In addition, it is mentioned that he spoke in a derogatory way about the Peruvian Army during the Independence of Peru, accusing them, in a very prejudiced way, of being a hindrance to the Venezuelan high command in the United Liberation Army of Peru, and, by nature, more incompetent. that the Colombian soldiers, who deserved to have the credit of the entire campaign over the rest of the nationalities, being very bitter that the Peruvians did not show \"gratitude\" to the Colombian army and that they were reluctant to maintain traditions of the Spanish ancient regime:\"These Peruvians are not good for soldiers and they flee like deer! (...), Not from you a room for all of Peru, although no one moves at all nor does it seem that these gentlemen are disturbed by the slightest danger. Sometimes I do not understand them their Inca language, I don\\'t know if they are calm or not!\"\"We no longer have to count on the Chileans and Argentines, and these Peruvians are the most miserable men for war. Of course, we must resolve to sustain this fight alone.\" Hiram Paulding, a US sailor who visited him in his camp in Huaraz, recounts that Bolívar told him that the Peruvians “were cowards and that, as a people, they did not have a single manly virtue. In short, his insults were harsh and unreserved... Then they told me that he always used to speak like that about Peruvians.\" According to Jorge Basadre, Bolívar\\'s anti-Peruvian feelings would explain his triumphalist proclamations with Colombia, where he declared, after the Battle of Ayacucho, that \"The loyalty, perseverance and courage of the Colombian army has done everything\". Given this, it has been denounced that Bolívar had a very unpleasant treatment with the Peruvian troops under his command, an example is in a case that occurred with Ramon Castilla, who for trying to prevent a Peruvian cavalry corps from being arbitrarily added to a Gran Colombian unit during the Junín campaign, the young Peruvian soldier would suffer a humiliating insult: the Venezuelans (under the command of Bolívar) would have him put in stocks, and even wanted to shoot him, despite being part of the same side and in combat against the royalists. In the process a duel took place between the Cuiraceros of Peru and the Hussars of Colombia that took place on December 26, 1823.“It is so true that Bolívar has tried to persecute every able-bodied Peruvian without cause, and that when Brigadier General La Fuente was responsible for the last transformation of Trujillo [the Riva-Agüero prison] and that it was titled That Pacifier of the North, [Bolívar] instantly tried to overthrow him. La Fuente made the Peruvian cuirassiers hold on and punish the hussars of Bolívar\\'s guard, who wanted to run over them\" He was also accused of being very cruel against the troops of the Royal Army of Peru, where the repression was fierce, with executions of those who did not pay tithes, harassment of women, execution of prisoners without trial, slaughter of cattle, desecration of churches. , imprisonment of women and children in Huanta and the burning of the towns of Iquicha, Caruahuran and Huayllas (absent violence on the royalist side). The guerrillas had to take refuge in the hills in the Republic of Iquicha. After independence, the royalist Indians of Huanta had to bear the punishment for supporting the monarchists: it was the payment of a tax of 50,000 pesos that the entire homonymous party had to collect (except the towns of Quinua, Guaychán and Acosvinchos), which demanded Marshal Antonio José de Sucre \"for having rebelled against the system of Independence and freedom.\" In said imposition, coca prices were altered and caused an economic crisis.If the Iquicha Indians rose up against Bolívar\\'s republic, it was neither because they were \"deceived\" nor because they wanted to perpetuate the most oppressive features of the colonial system. Quite the opposite. They rose up to defend the rights and status that they had received as Indians from the colonial power, and that the criollo republic threatened to liquidate. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that he gave instructions to the army of Greater Colombia, during the Peruvian War of Independence, to carry out looting and other kinds of harassment against the Peruvian population, under the excuse that in times of war it was necessary to act dictatorially, giving extraordinary powers to the militia, and showing indifference to serious cases of corruption, of which Bolívar, instead of executing them, would rather have been in charge of distributing said loot (to avoid conflict between his caudillos) of the Peruvian victims to the looting of their properties. Only in the province of Lambayeque, which was not one of the richest, the amount of 500,000 pesos was extracted in 1824, by quotas and confiscations. In addition to the fact that he came to dismiss Peruvians like Andrés de los Reyes, due to his protests that he gave for Bolívar\\'s orders to loot churches. The discomfort caused by the looting of the Colombians made the indigenous guerrilla Ninavilca exclaim from the four winds that the Colombians were “una chusma de ladrones” [a mob of thieves] who plundered Peruvian resources, and once the conflict ended they did not become more popular, generating an Anti-Colombian (included anti-venezolan) feeling in Peru.. \"Not only did Bolívar transfer his dictatorial power to Heres. In each department, in each province of Peru occupied by the Colombians, small dictators exercised their functions, widely empowered to fleece the people (...) Prototype of those little dictators who in 1824 sowed terror in Peru, is that Manterola appointed governor of Huamachuco by Bolívar, who carried out his functions accompanied by his mistress, and at the same time that he looted the unfortunate towns of his jurisdiction and tortured his neighbors.\" Bolívar was also accused of carrying out a geopolitics with a clear anti-Peruvian direction in Gran Colombia, with absolute opposition to the interests of said political society, both in its form of the Viceroyalty of Peru and of the Republic of Peru, denouncing a mixture of admiration and envy of Peru\\'s economic privileges, as well as suspicion for its population, which he constantly described as contemptuous, even before intervening in its political affairs, since this antipathy would have been clearly distilled since the years of the famous Jamaica Letter.. (…) The Viceroyalty of Peru, whose population amounts to a million and a half inhabitants, is undoubtedly the most submissive and from which the most sacrifices have been made for the king\\'s cause, (…) Chile can be free. Peru, on the contrary, contains two enemy elements of every fair and liberal nature: gold and slaves [referring to the Indians]. The first corrupts everything; the second is corrupted by itself. The soul of a servant [referring to the common people of Peru] rarely manages to appreciate healthy freedom; he rages in riots or humbles himself in chains. (…)John Fisher says, based on a detailed study of the Liberator\\'s correspondence: \"To a certain extent his decision to go personally to Peru in August 1823 meant the desire to protect Gran Colombia from the Peruvians.\" Given this, he would try to wrest territories from him. to the Peruvians in the north, taking advantage of the fact that the independence Peru was still in the process of establishing itself as a sovereign country, despite being aware that provinces such as Maynas or Guayaquil were legally and culturally closer to Peru than to Colombia according to the principle of Uti possidetis iuris that he defended, which would be evidence of total dishonesty on his part in order to impose the expansionist interests of Gran Colombia against the Peruvians.\"Have you understood that the Corregimiento de Jaén has been occupied by those from Peru; and that Maynas belongs to Peru by a very modern Royal Order [Royal Cedula of 1802]: that it is also occupied by forces from Peru. We will always have to leave Jaén by Maynas and advance if possible our limits of the coast beyond Tumbes.\" After noticing, with disgust, the good image that Peru had (above Colombia and Venezuela) in the towns of Guayaquil, Cuenca and Loja in present-day Ecuador, either because the majority of its inhabitants were Quechua-speaking, or because of the proximity they had with the departments of Piura and Cajamarca, with which they had more trade and exchange than with Viceroyalty of New Granada, which was disconnected from the area by natural barriers in the Andes and the Pacific Ocean (arguments given by the Peruvian Francisco María Roca); harming applying the Free Determination of the peoples in their favor (in fact, the annexation of these territories to Gran Colombia would have been done in authoritarian and illegal ways), which would be aggravated by the centralist and authoritarian policies of the Bolivarian government, whose laws generated discontent in the Southern District. Given this, the mission to weaken Peru was gaining strength in him, until it became an obsession with traits of paranoia and arrogance, which pushed him to declare phrases such as:. \"The peoples of southern Colombia have Peru behind them, which tries to seduce them if San Martín wins, as can happen, or the royal army that tries to conquer them by force.\"\"San Martín left for Chile and has left Peru to all the horrors of civil war and anarchy: I would prefer that the Peruvians fall to pieces victorious than that they are subjugated by the Spaniards; because that case would do us less harm than the last.\"\"The Colombian troops have had the good fortune to stay in Lima: all this pleases me infinitely and you will know more by mail that I expect tomorrow. Meanwhile, I believe that I can safely go to Bogotá, to return later to understand the borders with Peru, which is of great importance, because the province of Maynas given to Peru by the king envelops all of southern Colombia on our backs (...) Peru, with all that it owes us, only thinks of our ruin. The newspapers consume us; San Martín and other of his bosses have been tearing me to pieces for the things of Guayaquil. In short, all this after having been treated with unlimited generosity. What will happen after we enter to dispute interests of all kinds?\"\"Peruvians are very funny, they have usurped two provinces from us (referring to Jaén and Maynas); four from Buenos Aires (referring to the provinces of Upper Peru) and they dispute Chiloé with Chile, and then they are afraid that they will be conquered, because the thief is always afraid of justice.\"\"At this moment I just learned that in the [Colombian] Congress there are good opinions regarding Upper Peru. I call good those who are inclined not to deliver it to Peru, because that is the basis of our public right\"It was even denounced that Bolivar had a final project to provoke a Total Dismemberment of Peru, because the opposition of the Peruvians to his political projects was latent and exaggeratedly feared by Bolívar, therefore, to dominate the Americas, he had a duty to further weaken Peru, being necessary to take away its hegemonic possibility against the neighboring republics in South America, so that he, as President for Life (with the right to name an heir), would rule over all and thus begin the Project of a Hispano-American Confederation (led by Gran Colombia after convoking the Congress of Panama), through the weakening of the Peruvian institutional framework for such purposes. So, he wanted a Federation of the Andes, which would unify Venezuela, Colombia, and Quito (later called Ecuador) with Peru and Bolivia, leaving Bolívar as president for life. But he believed that this Federation could not be done without dividing Peru again, since the other countries ran the risk of being more easily dominated by Peru, being economically weaker at the time. That was how he decided to separate Peru in two again, segregating the southern departments to form another republic. The legal framework that would unite the countries of the Federation would be the \"Constitución Vitalicia\" [Life Constitution] that Bolívar drafted for Bolivia, and that he would send to the Congress of Peru for its approval and later to that of Greater Colombia. In Lima there was a strong rejection of this alleged way of reunifying both societies in a federation of 3 states (consisting of Bolivia and a Peru divided into north and south), and it was predicted that the country would later be dominated by the leadership of Bogotá with the Bolivar\\'s confederation project. To achieve the separation of southern Peru, Bolívar had the support of the prefects (regional governors) of those departments, especially that of Arequipa, the military and politician Antonio Gutiérrez de La Fuente, laying the foundations for future Arequipa separatism in Peru. Thus, Andres de Santa Cruz sent a letter to La Fuente in which he informed him that, according to reliable anonymous testimony from the Republic of Bolívar, he was aware that Puno, Arequipa and Cuzco sought to make southern Peru independent and thus separate \"from the respectable Peruvian nation\". However, this final plan was prevented by the fall of the Peruvian Dictatorship of Bolívar in 1827, the Peruvian Intervention in Bolivia in 1828 for the fall of Sucre, and later the Dissolution of Gran Colombia after the Gran Colombian-Peruvian War. Not without Bolívar previously accusing the populations of Peru and Bolivia as \"the despicable peoples of the South who allowed themselves to be drawn into the civil war or were seduced by the enemies.\"Finally, the antecedents of the Gran Colombo-Peruvian War are considered by many historians as the maximum evidence of Bolívar\\'s anti-Peruvianism. It is reported that his acts of government left much to be desired and were even harmful to the Peruvian indigenous population, for which he imprisoned or shot guerrillas who had helped him in the campaigns in the mountains. To the indigenous people, to whom he dedicated his worst insults, he reimposed the indigenous tribute (which had been abolished in the viceroyalty with the constitution of Cádiz) and weakened their peasant communities with the abolition of the Cacicazgos in the young Republic of Peru, breaking thus definitively a hierarchical system of the Inca nobility that had been present, for more than 3 centuries in Peru, for the protection of the economic interests of the Indian against a nascent Gamonalismo. Another measure that made him detested by the indigenous people were the appraisals made in the midst of the war chaos, without control and many times by officials who were members of the Criollo aristocracy or bought by it, which allowed the individual division of their communal lands and their purchase by the landowners, in addition to restoring indigenous tributes, mitas, and pongueajes to help Peruvian finances. Likewise, he restored slavery to blacks, pardos and mulattos (which had been abolished by San Martín) for the benefit of sugar plantations on the coast. Lastly, the old colonial cabildos were abolished. It can also be shown that he would have carried out massive repressions against opponents who had his dictatorship in Peru, such as Juan de Berindoaga y Palomares (who was shot) or Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro (who would be deported). Sucre would have commented on several occasions to the Liberator that so many tributes were deceptive, and that many of the Peruvian elite wanted Bolívar\\'s failure to run to negotiate with the royalists. The Bolivarian regime quickly earned the animosity of Peruvians: Bolívar created a Supreme Court that imprisoned or exiled various political opponents, and shot patriotic soldiers or guerrillas who publicly disagreed. The exercise of freedom of the press was prevented and the right to elect their municipal authorities was withdrawn from the councils (May 26, 1826). Over time the Colombian army was seen as the praetorian guards of its puppet governments. In addition, a very thorny issue was that of \"replacements\", a compensation that Peru would make to Colombian troops for the casualties suffered by them during the war, by exchanging Peruvian citizens and expatriating them to Gran Colombia, exorbitant and inhuman requirement, given that the war had already ended. Given this, Bolívar demobilized most of the Peruvian units (about five thousand who replaced the Gran Colombian casualties) and after the capitulation of Callao, presented on February 10, 1826 the demand to send 6,000 Peruvian recruits to serve Venezuela. , sending the first contingents in July, probably no more than 3,000, officially to reinforce the defenses against a possible French invasion (Cien Mil Hijos de San Luis) but in reality it was to confront General Páez, who had started La Cosiata (a separatist movement in Venezuela) and also to demilitarize Peru so that it is not a future threat to its continental projects in the Patria Grande. The troops sent there, due to the distance and lack of knowledge of the language (the majority were indigenous who barely knew Spanish) made desertion or mutiny difficult, many of those sent dying due to the weather and tropical diseases. It is known that some survivors were repatriated of New Granada and Venezuela in 1852 and 1857 respectively. Due to the lifelong and authoritarian constitutions promulgated for Peru and Bolivia, the Liberator would be accused of using his armies to impose political systems, in a republican imperialism, rather than making countries independent.  Even the Chilean and Rio de la Plata governments mistrusted Bolívar, accusing him of not letting each people decide their future. Bolívar\\'s attitude contributed to accentuate this negative climate. He was irritable and reacted violently to the slightest contradiction. His egomania, already great, increased in those days to unimaginable levels when he had territories from the Venezuelan Caribbean to the Bolivian altiplano under his control. According to a diplomatic source from the United States, in 1826, during the celebration of his birthday, Bolívar stated at a banquet in his honor that he was \"the greatest man of all those recorded in history, and that not only the heroes of antiquity were inferior to him in liberal ideas, but also Washington and Napoleon had lagged behind.\" He also used to do various eccentricities, such as suddenly stopping on the table and kicking bottles and glasses, as if to indicate that he could do whatever he wanted in Peru. In addition, in 1828, when the Peruvians entered Bolivia and After Sucre was deposed, Bolívar sought to create a \"Bogotá-Rio de Janeiro axis\" abandoning his previous attempts to isolate the Brazilian monarchy in order to achieve an anti-Peruvian coalition. It was a failure due to Colombian political instability and the geographical distances between its centers of power. Even after being expelled from the government of Peru and the Gran Colombo-Peruvian war ended, he would continue to rant against Peru and its people in multiple letters, considering them the greatest disgrace on the American continent and with a people complicit in tyranny, seeing the country as epitome of all the anarchic defects that plagued Latin America after the independences:\"What men, or what demons, are these! From one end to the other, the New World seems an abyss of abomination; and if anything were lacking to complete this frightful chaos, Peru, with too much, would be enough to fill it. Accomplice of their tyrants during the War of Independence, without yet achieving its freedom, Peru anticipates tearing up its own bosom in the first days of its existence.The gallant General San Martín, at the head of the Chileans and the Argentineans, expels to the Spaniards from Trujillo to Ica. For Lima, there was no Peru but freedom, and at once some were bent on getting rid of San Martín, whose services they most urgently needed. This act of ingratitude breaks Peru\\'s political career and follows the I galloped to Girón, where the most execrable work was consummated...\"It is also known that, during the monarchical attempt in Gran Colombia, Bolívar saw as envious and delusional countries the new American States that did not accept the leadership of others (for example, France and the United Kingdom), such as Peru and the Dominican Republic, in so much so that Bolívar believed that the new independent states should accept the protection and submission to a world Power to protect themselves from internal anarchy and international isolation. Peru in these letters is considered as \"the flame of discord\" in the South American Continent.\"What you are pleased to tell me regarding the new project of naming a successor to my authority who is a European prince, does not catch me again, because something had been communicated to me with not a little mystery and a bit of timidity, since you know my way of acting. think.. I don\\'t know what to say to you about this Idea, which contains a thousand inconveniences. You must know that, for my part, there would be none, determined as I am to leave the command in this next Congress, but who can mitigate the ambition of our leaders and the fear of inequality among the lowly people? Don\\'t you think that England would be jealous of the choice made in a Bourbon? How much would not be opposed by all the new American states, and the United States that seem destined by Providence to plague America with miseries in the name of Liberty? It seems to me that I already see a general conspiracy against this poor Colombia, already too envied by all the Republics America has. All the presses would be in motion calling for a new crusade against the accomplices of treason against freedom, addicts of the Bourbons and violators of the American system. In the South, the Peruvians would ignite the flame of discord; by the Isthmus those of Guatemala and Mexico, and by the Antilles the Americans and the liberals of all parts. Santo Domingo would not stay idle and call his brothers to make common cause against a prince of France. They would all become enemies without Europe doing anything to support us, because the New World is not worth the expense of a Holy Alliance; At least, we have reason to judge so, due to the indifference with which we have been seen to undertake and fight for the emancipation of half the world, which very soon will be the most productive source of European prosperity. In short, I am very far from being opposed to the reorganization of Colombia according to the experienced institutions of wise Europe. On the contrary, I would be infinitely happy and revive my strength to help in a work that can be called salvation and that can be achieved not without difficulty supported by us from England and France. With these powerful aids we would be capable of everything, without them, no. For the same reason, I reserve myself to give my definitive opinion when we know what the governments of England and France think about the aforementioned change of system and choice of dynasty.\" Some historians, such as Rubén Vargas Ugarte, affirm that the lack of good faith in his actions and his lack of appreciation for Peruvian chiefs and officials (which make him less than ideal from a moral point of view), together with the set of Bolívar\\'s anti-Peruvian insults, would be the product of his \"nervous breakdowns\".. Antonio José de Sucre, during his actions in the Secession of Upper Peru (where the independence of Upper Peru was not foreseeable by \"judgment persons\", if not by a regionalist oligarchy) or in the Gran Colombo-Peruvian War (of which accuses him of being excessively triumphalist and generating dishonours), in addition to proposing the fragmentation of Peru into a Republic of the north and south while ceding Arica to the Republic of Bolívar. He was also accused of having returned to the Ayacucho Capitulation an agreement with humiliating conditions for Peruvians, which would not feel like a victory.\"Doctor Olañeta has told me that he believes it is not only difficult but impossible to reunite the high provinces to Buenos Aires: that there is an irreconcilable enmity: that they remain independent or attached to Peru; because the vote of men of judgment is about to belong to the Peru, in which case they want the capital in Cuzco, or closer to them. May this news serve as the government, which is corroborated by many others, so that you can tell me based on these data what to do or proceed in these businesses. My position can give me the case of giving some march to the opinion of those towns and you will tell me what is best for the public cause.\" The considerations of Sucre\\'s decree would be contradictory and weak to camouflage anti-Peruvian sentiment. On the one hand, he would say that \"it is not up to the liberation army to intervene in the businesses of these towns,\" and yet he convened a political assembly under the auspices of the President of Colombia (Bolívar). He would also say that Argentina, heir to the viceregal rights over Upper Peru, \"lacks a General Government\" and that \"there is therefore no one to deal with\", but he does not mention that Peru also had rights, as well as that its government was established and running. But the most absurd of all, and also the most important, is that in his last recital, Sucre says that he convenes the assembly, because he has that right as \"the majority of the liberation army is made up of Colombians.\"  This would indicate the total lack of respect that Sucre had, both for the Peruvian government and for Peruvians. In addition, Sucre would have no authority to call an assembly (neither by Bolívar nor by the Congress of Peru), and yet he called it. Later Simón Bolívar would annul the right to veto that he had granted to the Peruvian congress to endorse the acts of the assembly of 1825. It should also be added that, in the Independence of Upper Peru, the indigenous masses did not participate, only the upper strata of the population, that is, Criollos of the elite. However, due to his control of the army and the congresses of Lima and Chuquisaca, Sucre and especially Bolívar held the last word on the destiny of Upper Peru. Limeños were annoyed that according to the principle of Uti possidetis iuris, the viceroyalty of New Granada had become independent intact, while theirs had not.  Later he would come to offer the territories of the then southern coast of Peru (Tacna, Arica and Tarapaca) to Bolivia, but these procedures would be prevented by the fall of the Bolívar and Sucre dictatorship in Peru and Bolivia. Furthermore, in a letter to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Ortiz de Zevallos revealed Sucre\\'s decisive opposition to Bolívar\\'s Federation project until Peru was divided into two States. Sucre wanted to delay any union of Bolivia with Peru as long as possible (knowing that it would fall under the latter\\'s hegemony when it passed, weakening his government), annex all the territories offered by Ortiz, confront Colombia with Peru, secure his back by agreeing with Chile and Buenos Aires, and separate Arequipa, Cuzco and Puno from Peru. All this is demonstrated when Sucre indicated to Ortiz de Zevallos that: \"only under that plan could Bolivia not fear that Peru would absorb it, as happens when a small State links up with a larger and stronger one\". As well as when in 1827, Sucre appointed dean Gregorio Funes, a Bolivarian Argentine, who was carrying out the functions of Colombian minister in Buenos Aires, to receive the post of Bolivian minister in the same Argentine capital. Through Funes, Sucre addressed the issue of an alliance between Bolivia, Argentina and Chile, which was supposedly to stop Brazilian expansionism, but in practice he was looking for support against Peru because he knew its weakness against it, and suggested that the participation of Gran Colombia in the war against Brazil could occur through a treaty. From Santiago de Chile, Andrés Santa Cruz interpreted Sucre\\'s opening to Buenos Aires as an attempt to form \"an anti-popular and very particularly anti-Peruvian pact.\" The negotiations did not prosper because the Peruvians also sent agents who assured that Bolívar intended to divide the continent between two great empires: one Colombian and the other Brazilian. In practice, Sucre depended so much on the orders of Bolívar that he was quickly seen by Peruvians and people of the River Plate as a puppet or bridgehead of the Liberator in the continental south, a “proconsul of the Bolivian empire”.\"You can\\'t think of the multitude of papers that come from Peru to upset Bolivia. Until today they have had no influence, but perhaps in the long run they will do something. the Argentines. I am happy about this because I will be able to carry out the project of the federation of Chile, Bolivia and Buenos Aires.\" Subsequently, Sucre would have carried out an intense campaign to seize Arica from Peru and give it to Bolivia for its annexation to a natural outlet to the sea, proposing it in October 1826, he also warned Bolívar, during one of his letters of the year 1828, about the danger that Peru would be for Gran Colombia:\"If Peru conquers Bolivia and keeps it, the South of Colombia (current Ecuador) runs a thousand and a thousand risks.\" To this is added the testimony of the Argentine minister M. Bustos, who on October 27, 1828 said in the Buenos Aires newspaper \"El Tiempo\" that Sucre and Gamarra had put together a plan to make Bolívar the Emperor of South America, separating Puno, Arequipa and Cuzco from the Republic of Peru, something Bolívar was aware of but did not want to make a false step. The centralism of the capital only produced new supporters of federalism and, in some cases, of secession, in Arequipa. The prefect of Puno, Benito Laso de la Vega, tried to convince his colleagues in Lampa, Agustín Gamarra from Cuzco and Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente from Arequipa, of a project of \"microfederalism\" or \"provincial federation\" to separate the south and force the whole country to join the Andean federation of Bolívar. Santa Cruz did everything he could to prevent greater autonomy in the regions and persecute any separatist movement. He removed Laso from his duties and warned the other two. Later, during the Gran Colombian-Peruvian War, Sucre\\'s anti-Peruvian attitudes were denounced, who, to commemorate the triumph of the Gran Columbian army over the Peruvian advance, ordered the construction of a commemorative obelisk on the site where the battle occurred, with an inscription increasing the number of Peruvian soldiers that took part in action and decreasing their own, in the following terms:. \"The Peruvian army of 8,000 soldiers that invaded the land of their liberators, was defeated by 4,000 braves from Colombia on February 27, 1829.\". José de La Mar protested the words on the monument, which he considered triumphalist and erroneous. In addition, he complained about the treatment received by the Peruvian dead and prisoners after the battle, with emphasis on the decapitation of the corpse of Pedro Raulet, one of the officers who fell in Tarqui, whose head was nailed to a pike and paraded through the streets of Cuenca. He maintained that only the vanguard made up of about a thousand men had been destroyed in Tarqui, after having vigorously resisted the entire Gran Colombian army; and he added that his attack on the most immediate plain was awaited in vain after the charge of the Cedeño squadron had been repulsed by the Husares de Junín. He emphasized that the entire Peruvian army had not gathered more than 4,500 men and that by mentioning their number raising it to 8,000, Sucre had made a willful mistake for anti-Peruvian reasons. For all these reasons, he declared the Girón Agreement suspended: \"while [...] satisfaction capable of indemnifying the injuries received is given, and the depressive documents are destroyed, the existence of which would drive away even the hope of reconciliation.\" For this reason, he proceeded to denounce the Girón Agreement, once again preparing to undertake hostilities.

      "{'input': ' Background. José Calvo Sotelo was a leader of the anti-Republican Right wing, especially after the defeat of the \"possibilist policy of Gil-Robles\" in the elections of February 1936, which \"paradoxically meant the endorsement of the theses of Calvo Sotelo, who had pointed out the sterility\" of the policy. His anti-democratic ideology was manifested on numerous occasions. In the campaign for the general elections of November 1933 he made it clear that he intended to overthrow the Parliament due to its \"irremissible and sterile decrepitude\", and promised that the one that would emerge from the elections \"will be the last one with universal suffrage for many years\". He repeated the same promise during the campaign for the following elections, those of February 1936: \"We must try at all costs to make these elections the last ones\". \"I do not believe that when a people, like Spain now, is diluted in the detritus of ignominy and suffers the ulceration of the worst ferments, the appeal to inorganic suffrage, so full in its entrails of errors and imperfections, can be an effective formula to heal, purify and vivify it. [...] Peoples that every two or three years discuss their existence, their tradition, their fundamental institutions, cannot prosper. They live predestined to destitution\", said Calvo Sotelo. As an alternative to the \"liberal democratic State\", which \"cannot solve the Spanish problem\", he proposed the implementation of a \"corporative and authoritarian State\".The Republican Left deputy Mariano Ansó described Calvo Sotelo as \"the most characterized enemy of the regime\". The then editor of the monarchist newspaper ABC, Luis de Galinsoga, recalled twenty-four years after his assassination in an article \"his unwavering determination to go to the last consequence of his combativeness against the Republic; which he had abhorred from its very origin and with which he never compromised, not even at the moments when the Republic seemed to dress up in sheep\\'s clothing\". Indeed, from the very day of the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, Calvo Sotelo actively participated in the coup conspiracy of 1936 that would lead to the coup d\\'état of July 1936. He frequently invoked the intervention of the Army to put an end to the \"anarchy\" brought about by the Popular Front Government and was informed of the plans of the uprising led by General Mola —he even offered himself to the latter as another combatant under the orders of the Army—.Many of the civilian elements who encouraged and supported the coup conspiracy, especially the monarchists, were convinced that Calvo Sotelo would be one of the top leaders of the regime which would be established after the overthrow of the Republic. This was the belief of Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, one of the monarchists most committed to the anti-Republican conspiracy. In his memoirs he wrote: \"I always thought that the politician who was to carry out the work that would convert the uprising into a legally outlined renovation of the Spanish State was going to be Calvo Sotelo\". The same thought was shared by Eduardo Aunós, who like Calvo Sotelo had been a minister in the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. When Calvo Sotelo said that he was convinced of the existence of the man \"who at the right moment will give the voice of salvation [of Spain]\", Aunós answered him: \"Yes... but you will be at his side, lending him the help of your great intelligence and your fervent enthusiasm\".. Calvo Sotelo\\'s interventions in the Cortes (Spanish Parliament), like those of the CEDA leader José María Gil-Robles, were always the object of \"contemptuous aversion\" and \"extreme aggressiveness\" on the part of the majority of the Popular Front deputies. The speech he made on April 15, in which he listed in detail the hundreds of violent acts that had taken place in Spain since the elections (according to Calvo Sotelo there had been 74 dead and 345 wounded, and 106 religious buildings had been set on fire, one of them the church of San Luis Obispo \"two hundred steps from the Ministry of the Interior\"), was interrupted several times by the left wing deputies. Some accused him of being behind the Falangist attacks: \"You are the employers of the gunmen\", \"How much did you have to pay the assassins?\" Others reminded him of the repression suffered by the revolutionaries of Asturias. The Communist Dolores Ibárruri \"La Pasionaria\" told him: \"Go and say those things in Asturias\", while the Socialist Margarita Nelken shouted at him: \"We are going to bring here all those who have been rendered useless in Asturias\". And when Calvo Sotelo said that \"the [violent] rampage lasts weeks and months\", she shouted back: \"And long will it last!\"In the sessions of the following weeks the attacks continued. In the May 6 session Margarita Nelken interrupted him again saying: \"the executioners have no right to speak\". In the session of May 19, the Socialist deputy Bruno Alonso González challenged Calvo Sotelo to go out into the street to settle accounts after the latter had said to him \"Your Honor is a little thing, a pygmy\", in response to an interruption by Alonso González in which he had said to him: \"We already know what Your Honor is; but he does not have the courage to declare it publicly\" (Calvo Sotelo had just said: \"I am interested in putting on record this evident conformity of mine with fascism in the economic aspect, and as for what I could say in the political aspect, I keep quiet for the reason I have previously indicated to Mr. Casares Quiroga...\", who had just declared \"against fascism the Government is belligerent\"). \"Your Honor is a pimp!\" Alonso González had replied to Calvo Sotelo when the latter called him a \"pygmy\". The president of the Cortes finally managed to restore order —Alonso González was invited to leave the Chamber— and Calvo Sotelo continued with his speech.In the Cortes session of June 16, \"perhaps the most dramatic\" and \"the most quoted in the history of the Republic\", Calvo Sotelo also intervened to say, amidst frequent interruptions and shouts, that in Spain there was \"disorder, pillage, plunder, looting, destruction everywhere\" and to defend once again the establishment of an authoritarian and corporative State and to proclaim himself a Fascist: \"Many call this State a Fascist State, because if that is the Fascist State, I, who participate in the idea of that State, I who believe in it, declare myself a Fascist\". A deputy exclaims: \"What a novelty!\". Calvo Sotelo then made a call for the intervention of the Army (\"the military man would also be crazy who at the head of his destiny would not be ready to rise up in favor of Spain and against anarchy, if it were to occur\", said Calvo Sotelo), which provoked the protests of the left wing deputies and the angry reaction of the President of the Government Santiago Casares Quiroga who made him responsible for future coup attempts, a responsibility which Calvo Sotelo accepted (Casares Quiroga said: \"It is lawful for me to say that after what Your Honor has done today before Parliament, of any case [in Spanish, he said \"caso\" (case) not \"cosa\" (thing), as the Francoist historiography would transcribe] that might occur, which will not occur, I will hold Your Honor responsible\"; to which Calvo Sotelo replied: \"I have, Mr. Casares Quiroga, broad shoulders. Your Honor is an easy man and quick to make challenging gestures and threatening words. [...] I consider myself notified of Your Honor\\'s threat. [...] It is preferable to die with glory than to live with vilification\"; he then compared him to the Russian Kerenski and the Hungarian Karoly).On July 1, what was to be the last plenary session of the Cortes before the civil war was held and which proved to be the most conflictive. There was frequent shouting, interruptions and incidents. The most serious moment took place when, after Calvo Sotelo\\'s intervention, which was interrupted, as was customary, on numerous occasions, the Socialist deputy Ángel Galarza, a member of the Socialist caballerist party, made a threat to the monarchist leader which was not at all veiled. After vehemently protesting that in the Cortes one could make apologies for fascism, as, in his opinion, Calvo Sotelo had just done —he had said, for example, that \"political parties are chlorotic confraternities of congressmen\" and that the solution to the problems \"will be found in a corporate State\"—, he said that against Calvo Sotelo \"I find everything justified, even personal attacks\" (these words were not recorded in the Journal of Sessions by order of the President of the Chamber, but they were picked up by some newspapers). A journalist present in the Chamber transcribed Galarza\\'s intervention as follows:. ...the speaker is surprised that he comes to speak to Parliament in favor of the independence of justice who, like Mr. Calvo Sotelo, has participated in the seven years of dictatorship, that his party and, in general, all the socialist groups are enemies of personal violence. But against whoever pretends to be the head of the Spanish fascist movement and to conquer power by violence, to take those who militate in the left wing parties to concentration camps and prisons, violence is legitimate, and in such a case can go as far as personal attack.. Galarza\\'s speech was applauded by his party colleagues, but the president of the Cortes, Diego Martínez Barrio, visibly indignant, immediately intervened to reply: \"Violence, Mr. Galarza, is not legitimate at any time or in any place; but if in any part that illegitimacy goes up a notch, it is here. From here, from the Parliament, violence cannot be advised. The words of Your Honor, as far as that is concerned, will not be recorded in the Journal of Sessions\". Galarza replied: \"I submit, of course, to the decision of the Presidency, because it is my duty, out of the respect I owe it. Now, those words, which will not appear in the Journal of Sessions, the country will know them, and it will tell us if the violence is legitimate or not\".The historians who defend the thesis of the existence of an agitation campaign by the right wing to \"justify\" the coup which part of the Army was preparing with its support consider that the interventions in the Cortes by Calvo Sotelo, like those of Gil-Robles, were part of that campaign. According to these historians, the intention of the two leaders of the non-republican right wing was to make the situation of violence in the streets profitable by elaborating an \"incendiary\" and \"catastrophist\" discourse, which was disseminated and amplified by the press of the same political persuasion. Eduardo González Calleja has gone so far as to affirm that \"the Civil War was declared before in Parliament than in the streets\" and that in this task Calvo Sotelo stood out especially, who \"from the first moment in the Cortes maintained a frankly provocative attitude\". An assessment that is fully shared by José Luis Martín Ramos who highlights the following phrase from Calvo Sotelo\\'s speech: \"The cause is not of the Government, the cause is superior. It is of the State. It is that the democratic and parliamentary regime and the Constitution of 1931 have produced an economic disorder and a social disorder\". A similar position is held by the historians Julio Aróstegui and Paul Preston.For his part, the Italian historian Gabriele Ranzato, who does not subscribe to the thesis of the existence of a right wing agitation campaign that \"justified\" the coup, has pointed to Calvo Sotelo as one of those \"responsible for the violence that was tearing the country apart\", due to his continuous calls for the intervention of the army, a \"solution of force\" \"desired, favored, plotted and supported by him since the birth of the Republic, of which he had always declared himself an open enemy\". \"He was and remained to the end a declared enemy of the democracy brought by the Republic. In this anti-democratic militancy Calvo Sotelo was, without doubt, the most outstanding figure and he had followed a cursus honorum capable of attracting great political hostility and intense popular hatred\".The truth is that Calvo Sotelo felt threatened with death. Already in the Cortes session of April 15 he had said that he had \"the honor of appearing on the black lists\". A few hours after the harsh dialectical confrontation he had with the President of the Government Santiago Casares Quiroga on June 16, Calvo Sotelo visited the editor of the monarchist newspaper ABC Luis de Galinsoga to whom he said: \"You will already understand that after what Casares said this afternoon in Congress, my life is pending the slightest street incident, authentic or provoked by themselves, and I would like you, who are at the newspaper until dawn, to warn me immediately of any event of this kind so that I am not caught unawares by reprisals, although I believe that everything will be useless, because I consider myself sentenced to death.\" On some occasions he slept away from his home. He even became distrustful of the policemen who had been assigned to escort him. His friends and co-religionists also feared that he would be the victim of an attack and at the beginning of July one of them, Joaquín Bau, gave him a Buick automobile as a gift with the purpose of having it armored. On July 10, only three days before his assassination, they had been testing it in the Parque del Buen Retiro.The one who also felt threatened with death was Assault Guard Lieutenant José del Castillo, well known for his commitment to the Socialists whose militias he trained, especially after the May 8 assassination of Captain Carlos Faraudo by Falangist gunmen. His name appeared on a list, supposedly drawn up by the UME, of Socialist soldiers to be assassinated, Faraudo being the number one target. The second on the list was Lieutenant Castillo. One of the soldiers who also appeared on the list, Artillery Captain Urbano Orad de la Torre, who had been Faraudo\\'s companion in the UMRA, was convinced that the attack had not been the work of the Phalanx, but of the UME, and so, with the approval of his comrades, he sent a document to a member from that clandestine anti-Republican military organization in which he said that \"if another similar attack were to take place, we would reply with the same coin, but not in the person of an Army officer, but in that of a politician. For it was the politicians who were responsible for such a state of affairs\".At the funeral of Captain Faraudo, Lieutenant Colonel Julio Mangada, \"visibly moved\" —he was a close friend of Faraudo\\'s—, declared before the tomb \"the need to demand that the Government act more energetically against the fascist and reactionary provocations and if it does not do so we must swear to pay an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\". The funeral was also attended by Captain Federico Escofet, who was in Madrid because he had been elected delegate for the election of the President of the Republic, which was to be held the following day, May 10. Next to him a young man told him that it was necessary to avenge the death of Captain Faraudo by taking reprisals against some high leader of the right wing. It was Civil Guard Captain Fernando Condés, who two months later would head the group that assassinated Calvo Sotelo. Motive and prelude. On Sunday, July 12, around ten o\\'clock at night, Lieutenant of the Assault Guard José del Castillo, well known for his commitment to the Socialists, as well as belonging to the UMRA, was assassinated in a central street of Madrid. The identity of the assailants is unknown and, as Luis Romero has pointed out, \"much has been said over who killed Castillo\", although it is clear that the murder was \"perpetrated by the right wing\" and that \"it was part of a chain of attacks and reprisals\". The news of his death caused an enormous commotion among his colleagues at the Pontejos Barracks where he was stationed. Two of the most exalted were Captain Eduardo Cuevas de la Peña, chief of the 6th Company, and Lieutenant Alfonso Barbeta, of the 2nd Company, the same as Castillo\\'s. One of the two —the defamed witnesses— was a man who had been killed in the same way as Castillo. One of the two —witnesses differ— in a defiant gesture threw his cap at the feet of the director general of Security José Alonso Mallol, who had come to the aid center where Castillo had been admitted dead. Mallol did not take any disciplinary action for this insubordination and limited himself to asking for calm. The funeral chapel was set up in the red room of the General Directorate of Security and Castillo\\'s wife, his relatives and officers of the Assault Guard went there. Also present were members of the socialist militias, especially those of \"La Motorizada\", of which Lieutenant Castillo was an instructor, headed by their chief Enrique Puente and among them were Luis Cuenca, skilled in the handling of the pistol and who on some occasions had acted as escort for the centrist socialist leader Indalecio Prieto, and Santiago Garcés, who had also provided protection services. All of them were shocked by the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo, but especially Luis Cuenca, a personal friend of his.. Around midnight, officers, non-commissioned officers and fellow guardsmen of Castillo gathered at the Pontejos barracks of the Assault Guard, some of them in civilian clothes, such as the guard José del Rey, who had acted as escort for the Socialist deputy Margarita Nelken. Civilians belonging to the socialist militias also attended, especially from \"La Motorizada\" (Cuenca and Garcés among them), as well as a civil guard captain in civilian clothes. This was Fernando Condés, a close friend of Castillo\\'s (both were instructors of the socialist militias and belonged to the UMRA). In the midst of the indignation, many clamored for revenge for this and other murders committed by right wing gunmen, as had been the case of Captain Faraudo. The most exalted said: \"We cannot allow this! We cannot tolerate it any longer! The Government is letting them [the Falangists] murder us and it will do nothing!\" As soon as Lieutenant Barbeta returned from the Surgical Team he had Castillo\\'s company formed to tell the guards in very exalted tones that the murder of Lieutenant Castillo must not go unpunished. However, in his statement before the examining magistrate he will say that he gathered them together to calm them down and tell them \"to be resigned to what had happened\". Barbeta also instructed a corporal he trusted, Emilio Colón Parda, to select eight or ten guards to participate in a very reserved service.A group of officers of the Assault Guard —among them Captain Antonio Moreno, chief of the 2nd Company— left Pontejos to meet with the Minister of the Interior Juan Moles to whom they demanded in an ill-disciplined manner the immediate punishment of the culprits, whom they considered to have been Phalanx gunmen. They managed to obtain a list with the names and addresses of Phalanx members suspected \"of being active in the bands of gunmen\" in order to arrest them immediately. In his memoirs Manuel Tagüeña, a member of the socialist militias who also went to the Pontejos barracks, stated that other names were added to the list, provided by Francisco Ordóñez —a socialist militiaman friend of his who had gone with him— who, taking advantage of the removal of a Phalanx headquarters, had taken possession of the files. The historian Stanley G. Payne asserts, without providing any evidence, that the officers of the Assault Guard decided on their own to also add to the list whose detention had been authorized by the Minister of the Interior the names of the main leaders of the right wing such as Antonio Goicoechea, José María Gil-Robles and José Calvo Sotelo, although the latter two enjoyed parliamentary immunity because they were deputies. Castillo\\'s comrades, according to Gabriel Jackson, wanted \"to carry out a spectacular revenge\" and \"without taking into account any political party or program, and without reflecting on the great repercussions of their act, they decided to assassinate an important right wing leader\". Assassination. After midnight, Lieutenant Alfredo León Lupión is in charge of organizing the departure of the assault guard vans from the Pontejos barracks to arrest the people assigned to each one of them (the Socialist militiaman Manuel Tagüeña participates in the elaboration of the lists of the Falangists to be arrested, who, according to his own account, chose those with the highest quota and those who were listed as workers, since he suspected that they might be professional gunmen). Around half past one, the driver of van number 17, Orencio Bayo Cambronero, is called to perform a service. About ten Assault Guards designated by Lieutenants Alfredo León Lupión and Alfonso Barbeta (only the names of four of them are known: Bienvenido Pérez, Ricardo Cruz Cousillos, Aniceto Castro Piñeira and Esteban Seco), plus four civilian members of the socialist militias (Luis Cuenca and Santiago Garcés, of \"La Motorizada\", spearhead of the prietist sector; Francisco Ordóñez and Federico Coello García, both staunch caballerists —in fact Coello was the fiancé of a daughter of Largo Caballero—) in addition to the guard José del Rey Hernández who dressed in civilian clothes (Del Rey was well known for his socialist ideas and had been sentenced to six years and a day for his participation in the October Revolution of 1934; after being amnestied he was assigned to the Political Vigilance Service and was escort for the socialist deputy Margarita Nelken). Lieutenant León Lupión informs them all that in command of the van is the officer of the Civil Guard in civilian clothes, Fernando Condés —he had recently been readmitted to the corps and promoted to captain after being amnestied in February from the life sentence for having participated in the October Revolution of 1934 (and who like del Castillo and Faraudo had trained the socialist militias)—. \"That an officer of the Civil Guard should take command of one of these vans, represents a patent irregularity, and even more so if that captain is dressed in civilian clothes\", affirms Luis Romero. The same affirms Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza: \"That the vehicles would be used by civilians and guardsmen was certainly irregular, but even more so was the fact that León Lupión did not have the slightest inconvenience in handing over the command of van number 17 to Captain Condés, who, not being from the Assault Guard, but from the Civil Guard (where he was also awaiting assignment), could not be in charge of such a service\". Lieutenant León Lupión recognized many years later that \"Condés, in reality, should not have provided such a service\".As for the route taken by the van, there are discrepancies. According to Hugh Thomas or Gabriel Jackson, the group, \"without a very clear idea of where to go\" (in Thomas\\' words), went first to the house of a Falangist militant, but the address on the card was false. He then went to the residence of the leader of the Spanish Renovation party, Antonio Goicoechea, who was not at home. Then he went to the house of the leader of the CEDA, José María Gil-Robles, who was summering in Biarritz. Finally it was decided to go to Calvo Sotelo\\'s home, at number 89 Velázquez Street, corner of Maldonado. However, Luis Romero, author of a monograph on the assassination, affirms that the group commanded by Condés went directly to Calvo Sotelo\\'s house. The same affirms Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, author of a biography of Calvo Sotelo. For his part, Ian Gibson, author of another monograph on the subject, affirms that they first went to the home of José María Gil-Robles and when they did not find him they went to Calvo Sotelo\\'s house. Gibson relies on the testimony of Santiago Garcés to which he gives more value than the testimony of the four guards who were arrested and interrogated by the Francoist judges who said that the van did not make any intermediate stop between the Plaza de Pontejos and Calvo Sotelo\\'s home. There are also discrepancies as to the time they arrived at Velázquez Street. According to Hugh Thomas or Ian Gibson, it was around three o\\'clock in the morning of Monday the 13th. According to Stanley G. Payne, two o\\'clock. According to Luis Romero or Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, around half past two.In the doorway of the building where Calvo Sotelo\\'s house was located there were two policemen on night guard. Their names were Antonio Oñate Escribano and Andrés Pérez Moler. Both of them allowed the group led by Condés to pass as soon as he showed them his Civil Guard officer\\'s card —another element that convinced them was that they had arrived in an official car—.In the house at that time were Calvo Sotelo himself, his wife (Enriqueta Grondona), his four children (Conchita, seventeen years old; Enriqueta, fifteen, who was ill with fever; José, twelve years old, and Luis-Emilio, nine), the cook, the maid and the brother of the latter, fifteen years old, who acted as bellboy. Also living there was the French governess who came with the family from Paris when Calvo Sotelo finished his exile. They were all in bed when the group headed by Condés knocked at the door. The maid and the cook came and refused to open the door even though they said they were policemen coming to conduct a search and threatened to break down the door. They decide to wake up Calvo Sotelo who looks out on a balcony to ask the guards who are in the doorway if it is the police who are banging on the door. They answer yes. He also checks that a van belonging to the Assault Guards is parked there. Calvo Sotelo opens the door in bewilderment and some ten or twelve men, some in uniform and others in civilian clothes, burst into the apartment, going through all the rooms and pretending to be carrying out a search. One of them rips off the telephone cord from the office and throws a monarchist flag on the table to the floor. A guard stands next to the other telephone that was in the corridor.Once the \"search\" was over, Condés told Calvo Sotelo that they had orders to arrest him and take him to the General Directorate of Security. According to what his daughter Enriqueta told many years later, Calvo Sotelo said in surprise: \"Arrested? But why? What about my parliamentary immunity? And the inviolability of my home? I am a Deputy and the Constitution protects me!\" He then demanded to be allowed to telephone the General Director of Security, but they did not allow him to do so. He only calms down somewhat when Condés identifies himself as an officer of the Civil Guard. Calvo Sotelo calms his very anxious wife: \"Don\\'t worry. If it is true that it is an order from the Government, I will be back in an hour. I am a deputy of the Nation and the Government, as I know, they will not commit any outrage against my immunity\". Then he asked his wife to prepare a briefcase with some clothes, a fountain pen and some pages. She begs him not to leave, but she complies. Calvo Sotelo is not even allowed to dress in his bedroom in private. After kissing his four children —only the eldest daughter has woken up— he says goodbye to his wife whom he promises to telephone as soon as he arrives at the DGS, \"unless these gentlemen take me away to give me four shots,\" he tells her. According to Gabriel Jackson, Calvo Sotelo \"was a brave and strong man who suspected treason, and who was psychologically prepared to accept martyrdom.\" According to Ian Gibson, \"he was an undoubtedly brave man, who did not easily lose his head... At that time, he must have realized that the search was unlawful, and suspected that he was going to be murdered. But apparently, he did not create a violent scene, perhaps to spare his family the spectacle\".He descends the stairs accompanied by the governess with whom he speaks in French, which infuriates one of the guards who orders him to speak in Spanish. Calvo Sotelo has told him to warn his brothers Luis and Joaquín, but not his father who is suffering from a stomach ulcer that keeps him in bed —according to Ian Gibson, what he told him was to warn his friends and colleagues Andrés Amado and Arturo Salgado Biempica—. He meets the doorman of the estate to whom he says: \"They are taking me under arrest. I have not been able to talk on the phone.\" Upon arriving at the van he is ordered to sit in the third apartment facing the march, between two uniformed guards (one of them Aniceto Castro Piñeira). The bench in front is left unoccupied. Luis Cuenca is in the rear apartment. Captain Condés is seated next to the driver and next to him José del Rey (although he will deny it before the Francoist judges). Van number 17 starts off in the direction of Alcala Street. When it arrives at Ayala Street, Luis Cuenca shoots Calvo Sotelo twice in the back of the head, killing him on the spot. The body collapses on the floor of the van and is wedged between the two seats. Captain Condés does not make any comment nor does he order the truck to stop when he hears the shots, he limits himself to tell the driver to go to the East cemetery. According to one of the guards who was in the truck, when the shots rang out \"Condés and José del Rey exchanged glances and smiles of intelligence\", which Del Rey denied before the Francoist judges.. As the van approaches Alcalá Street, its occupants see a car that seems to be waiting for them. In it are Assault Lieutenants Alfonso Barbeta, of the 2nd Pontejos Company, and Máximo Moreno, of the Cavalry Group, both close friends of Lieutenant Castillo, along with three other people. They exchange greetings when the van arrives at Alcalá Street and turns left towards Manuel Becerra, the most direct route to the cemetery. \"Was this car, occupied by officers, to cover the \"operation\" in case of any unforeseen event? Or was it the vehicle that had gone to look for Gil-Robles at his house, and when it did not find him, went to check that the kidnapping and death of Calvo Sotelo had been carried out?\", Luis Romero asks.Shortly afterwards the van arrives at the gates of the East cemetery. It is about four o\\'clock in the morning. Seeing that it was an official vehicle, the two gravediggers on duty, Esteban Fernández Sánchez and Daniel Tejero Cabello, opened the gate for them. Captain Condés tells them that they are bringing an undocumented corpse. They drive the van to the morgue and leave the lifeless body of Calvo Sotelo on the floor next to one of the marble tables. Shortly afterwards the van leaves the cemetery. In 1943 Esteban Fernandez Sanchez reiterated before the Francoist judges of the General Cause (Spanish: General Cause) what he had already declared to the Republican examining magistrate. His testimony ended as follows: \"The witness, in spite of the abnormality of what happened, did not suspect the importance of the event, nor that it was the corpse of Mr. Calvo Sotelo; he was surprised by the appearance of the corpse and the strange way of bringing it, supposing that it had been the object of an attack and that for judicial purposes it would be taken directly to the depository of the aforementioned cemetery.According to Luis Romero, when the van returns to Pontejos Condés, Cuenca, Del Rey and others meet in Major Burillo\\'s office with him, Captain Moreno, head of Lieutenant Castillo\\'s Company, Pontejos lieutenants Alfonso Barbeta and Alfredo León Lupión, and Cavalry Group lieutenant Máximo Moreno. Towards dawn they are joined by Lieutenant Colonel Sanchez Plaza, head of the Madrid Assault Guard. However, Ian Gibson does not mention that this meeting took place and further states that Major Ricardo Burillo was not at the Pontejos Barracks because he was on duty that night at the General Directorate of Security. According to Gibson, giving credibility to Burillo\\'s testimony before the judges of the General Cause, he went to Pontejos around 7:00 a.m. when he learned that the van had left the group he commanded. He went along with Lieutenant Colonel Sanchez Plaza, who \"was going to give information about the event that had been ordered by the Minister of the Interior, Juan Moles.\" Alfonso Bullon de Mendoza also states that Major Burillo was at the DGS and that \"around seven o\\'clock\" he went to Pontejos along with Lieutenant Colonel Sanchez Plaza.On the other hand, Condés ordered the uniformed guards to remain silent and the driver Orencio Bayo to clean up the remains of blood left in the van. Aftermath. Discovery of Calvo Sotelo\\'s corpse. Immediately after her husband was taken away, Enriqueta Grondona asks for help from friends and colleagues of Calvo Sotelo\\'s party. For her part, the French governess fulfills the order and warns her brothers. The first to arrive at the house, accompanied by his wife, is Arturo Salgado Biempica, secretary and friend of Calvo Sotelo. Almost an hour has passed and there is still no news, so Enriqueta Grondona decides not to wait any longer and telephones the General Director of Security, Alonso Mallol. He unkindly replied that he knew nothing about Calvo Sotelo\\'s whereabouts and had not given any order to arrest him or search his house. According to Ian Gibson, the first to telephone Alonso Mallol were the two security guards who were guarding the gate and that Calvo Sotelo\\'s wife phoned him a little later. Gibson also states that the first person he spoke to was Commander Ricardo Burillo, the head of the Pontejos Group, who was on duty that night at the General Directorate of Security. Gibson relies on the statement made by Burillo in 1940 before the Francoist judges of the General Cause and on the confession he made to his fellow prisoner Rafael Sánchez Guerra two days before being shot, having been condemned to death for, among other alleged crimes, being directly responsible for the assassination of Calvo Sotelo.Shortly afterwards, his brothers Luis and Joaquín and prominent members of the Spanish Renovation party arrived at Calvo Sotelo\\'s home. An initial approach to the DGS was made by Arturo Salgado and the deputy Andrés Amado, but they were not received by Alonso Mallol. His secretary merely told them that orders had been given to look for the deputy Calvo Sotelo. Then Calvo Sotelo\\'s brothers, accompanied by Salgado and Amado and by Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, Spanish Renovation deputy for Santander, went to the Ministry of the Interior, whose headquarters were located in Puerta del Sol. It has just dawned. They are received by the Undersecretary Bibiano Fernández Osorio y Tafall, who tells them that in the Ministry there is no record that Calvo Sotelo has been arrested, but at a certain point he adds that traces of blood have been found in a van of the Assault Guards and that they are going to begin to investigate it. According to what Andrés Amado told three years later to the judges of the General Cause they asked that the guards in that van be arrested immediately, but Ossorio replied: \"It is not possible, because the forces that were in the van have left to serve in the embassies...\". Ian Gibson gives little credibility to this testimony because Amado was determined to prove the complicity of the DGS in the crime of his friend and co-religionist, which on the other hand was also the objective of the Francoist judges.For his part, the monarchist deputy Fernando Suárez de Tangil, Count of Vallellano, phoned around five in the morning to the house of the president of the Cortes Diego Martínez Barrio to inform him of the possible kidnapping of Calvo Sotelo, but it was his wife who took the message because she did not want to wake him up as she had gone to bed very late after returning from a trip to a farm in Valencia. He then tried to locate Vice President Luis Jiménez de Asúa, but was unsuccessful. According to his memoirs, Suárez de Tangil also called the Director General of Security Alonso Mallol, who hinted that Calvo Sotelo might have been murdered: \"I jumped up and had the most violent telephone conversation anyone can imagine. I told him, they had perpetrated an official assassination, Mallol answered me that he would not tolerate that and that he was going to send a truck with guards to arrest me; I answered him that I would not receive them like Calvo; and that was the end of the dialogue. Just in case, I took my boxes of big pistols and my pocket pistol down to my office and continued communicating...\".When Martínez Barrio\\'s wife gave him the news of the kidnapping, he felt dismayed and responsible because he was a deputy. The first person he called was the Count of Vallellano: \"count me as one more deputy of your minority, at your unlimited disposal, for communications to the President of the Council and Minister of the Interior, unspeakable parliamentary attack; I will inform you from hour to hour or sooner if necessary, I am not moving from here; 3000 civil guards are going out on all the roads that I know of...\". The Count replied: \"I don\\'t think that will be of any use, Mr. President, my friend should not be looked for on the roads, but in the Manzanares sewers or similar places, where he has been a corpse for some hours\". He then called the Minister of the Interior, Juan Moles, who assured him that the government had nothing to do with the matter. They agree to redouble their efforts to find Calvo Sotelo. Martínez Barrio then writes a note for Casares Quiroga that is taken to the Presidency by the Oficial Mayor of the Congress. The note says: \"Having been informed by the deputy Mr. Fernando Suárez de Tangil that the also deputy Mr. José Calvo Sotelo has been arrested early this morning, I am writing to Your Excellency so that you may kindly inform me of what happened and at the same time state that if the arrest has been ordered by a competent authority and had not been in case of in fraganti crime, in accordance with article 56 of the Constitution, he must be immediately released\". For his part, the deputy Geminiano Carrascal telephoned the president of his parliamentary group José María Gil-Robles who was in Biarritz to give him the news of the kidnapping of Calvo Sotelo, and the leader of the CEDA replied: \"I am leaving for Madrid right now\".. Around nine o\\'clock in the morning the director of the East cemetery decides to communicate to the City Council of Madrid that in the morgue there is an unidentified corpse that a detachment of Assault Guards has taken there at dawn, according to what the two gravediggers who were on duty have informed him. Mayor Pedro Rico, who has received the news that Calvo Sotelo is unaccounted for, orders that the councilors Aurelio Regúlez and Isidro Broceta (or Buceta) go immediately to the cemetery. It would be around eleven o\\'clock in the morning. The director of the cemetery also informed the General Directorate of Security and Alonso Mallol ordered Commissioner Aparicio to go quickly to the necropolis. The councilmen verify that it is Calvo Sotelo and so they inform Mayor Rico, who in turn calls Alonso Mallol to tell him \"with an altered voice\" that \"the missing person\" has been found (he does not pronounce Calvo Sotelo\\'s name). Commissioner Aparicio also confirms this and Alonso Mallol orders that the morgue and the area around the cemetery be cordoned off by the Civil Guard (and not by the Assault Guard to avoid tensions and incidents). Alonso Mallol communicates the news to the government, which at that moment is in session. Without knowing that the body had been found, Calvo Sotelo\\'s brothers arrive at the cemetery, accompanied by Paco Grondona, brother-in-law of the disappeared, and the monarchist deputies Andrés Amado and Pedro Sainz Rodríguez. Shortly afterwards, a multitude of journalists appeared at the cemetery, among them Santos Alcocer, reporter of the Catholic newspaper Ya. Also, prominent members of the right wing also went to the cemetery.The royalist deputies asked the government that the mortuary chapel be installed in the building of the Cortes or, if this was not possible, in the Academy of Jurisprudence, of which Calvo Sotelo was president. The government denies the permission and it is the president of the Cortes Martínez Barrio who in the evening informs the journalists of the decision, \"because it is a dangerous step, since, even if all the precautions that the Government has in its power were taken, there can always be elements interested in disturbing normality\". So the mortuary chamber will be installed in the morgue of the East cemetery, the same place where the body was found —it is located about two hundred meters from the mausoleum of the Calvo family—. He also tells the journalists that according to what the President of the Government has informed him in person, the death of Calvo Sotelo was caused by a firearm and not by a knife, as it had been claimed. The Government also decided not to allow the family and friends of the deceased to watch over the body during the night of July 13–14, which further inflamed the mood of the right wing. The lifeless body of Calvo Sotelo would not be exposed to the public until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, July 14, after the autopsy had been performed. Perpetrators and judicial investigation. According to the socialist Julián Zugazagoitia, just after the end of the war, Luis Cuenca, the perpetrator of the shots, showed up at his house at eight in the morning, about four hours after the assassination. Zugazagoitia was the director of the official newspaper of the PSOE, El Socialista, and a deputy belonging to the prietist sector. That it was Luis Cuenca is what some historians have deduced (although others have doubted it) because Zugazagoitia in his book did not identify him: \"The person at whose request I had been woken up was waiting for me in the office... His face had an expression of weariness on it, the exhaustion of one who has lost the night. Not many days later he was to lose his life in the Guadarrama pigsties. It seems to me a sign of respect for his death not to associate his name with the report he made to me. [...] I was afraid to ask and curious to know. My visitor knew the story in its details and I had the intimate conviction that he had participated in it, without being able to guess to what degree. That suspicion cut me off.\" When he told him that Calvo Sotelo had been assassinated Zugazagoitia said: \"That attack is war\". As soon as the unknown person left, Zugazagoitia phoned Indalecio Prieto who was in Bilbao to inform him of the assassination of the monarchist leader and to ask him to take \"the first train to Madrid, where you may be needed\".According to what the Socialist Juan Simeón Vidarte told many years later, the Captain of the Civil Guard Fernando Condés, the head of the group that had assassinated Calvo Sotelo, showed up at the PSOE headquarters, in Carranza Street, at half past eight in the morning of that Monday the 13th (almost at the same time that Cuenca allegedly told Zugazagoitia what had happened). He asked to speak with Prieto, with Lamoneda or with him. As the first two were not in Madrid, they called him at home and Vidarte quickly went to the headquarters. When he arrived, Condés was pale, discomposed, \"with red eyes\". When asked what was wrong, Condés told him: \"Something terrible. Last night we killed Calvo Sotelo\". \"The shock I felt was one of the most terrible received in my life,\" Vidarte wrote. Condés said that it had not been his intention for the trip to end with the assassination of the monarchist leader, but that they only intended to kidnap him to hold him hostage —and with him the other two leaders of the right: José María Gil-Robles and Antonio Goicoechea—, but added: \"Was Calvo Sotelo\\'s life worth more than those of Faraudo and Castillo or any of the comrades the Falangists are assassinating?\" Vidarte showed him his disgust for the assassination and his refusal to defend him as a lawyer if he were arrested (\"As a member of the Party you will find someone to defend you in court. Certainly not me. I am repulsed by this crime... That murder is going to be used against the Government and the Popular Front. It has been a barbarity of incalculable consequences\", Vidarte told him). When asked by Condés whether he should turn himself in, Vidarte replied that it would be better for him to wait and to look for a place to hide, if he had one (\"I do not consider myself empowered to make a decision of this importance. I have listened to you as in confession or as a lawyer listens to a defendant. Even if you were not the material author of the murder, you are the one who commanded the expedition and your responsibility is the same. I suppose that you will have somewhere to hide, while we see what the consequences of this assassination may be...\"). Condés told him that he could hide in the house of the Socialist deputy Margarita Nelken. \"There they will not dare to look for me. The guard accompanying her, as a watchman [he was referring to José del Rey], was also in the van.\"At 9 o\\'clock in the morning of that Monday the 13th, the Court of First Instance and Instruction No. 3 of Madrid, which was on duty, took charge of the case of the disappearance of Calvo Sotelo when the Directorate General of Security (DGS) informed them at that time that Deputy Calvo Sotelo had been taken from his house in the middle of the night by unknown persons and that the First Criminal Brigade had initiated an investigation to clarify the facts and find the whereabouts of the victim. The head judge was Ursicino Gómez Carbajo, who had already participated in the arrest of the Political Board of the Spanish Phalanx. He was also in charge of opening the investigation into the murder of Lieutenant Castillo. The judge was assisted by the judicial secretary Pedro Pérez Alonso and the authorized officer Emilio Macarrón. Shortly afterwards, the judge received a second communication from the DGS in which they told him that the two guards who were guarding Calvo Sotelo\\'s home had been placed at the disposal of the court. When the judge interrogates them, he realizes the seriousness of the case because they tell him that the arrest of Calvo Sotelo in the wee hours of the morning was carried out by a detachment of Assault Guards who had arrived there in an official van, whose number they do not remember, and that they were under the orders of a captain of the Civil Guard who showed them their documentation. Gómez Carbajo ordered the provisional arrest of the two guardsmen and immediately opened the preliminary investigation. In his testimony before the Francoist judges of the General Cause, Judge Gómez Carbajo, who according to Ian Gibson tried to \"implicate the Republican authorities in the crime,\" harshly criticized the alleged inaction of the police: \"I make detailed mention of the testimony of the Security guards, because he gives the key for any police body of medium professional and ethical solvency to follow a path that indeclinably had to lead to the clarification of the crime and the presentation before the Court of its confessed perpetrators, together with the elements of conviction, within a very limited period of hours. But the Security Directorate of Madrid remained in a punishable quietism...\".The first step of the investigation is to order the First Criminal Brigade to bring to court the assault guards who were on duty that night in the Pontejos barracks, after having found out that several vans had left the barracks during the early hours of the morning. He also ordered that the doorman of Calvo Sotelo\\'s estate and all the witnesses in the house who were not relatives be taken to the court. Shortly after, the driver Orencio Bayo Cambronero is taken to the court, but he denies having provided any service during the night and alleges that the truck number 17 that he was in charge of had appeared that morning in a different place than the one where he had left it. He continues to deny it even when he is recognized by the two guards who were guarding the doorway of Calvo Sotelo\\'s house, by the doorman, by the governess and by the bellboy. He had said the same when, before being taken to court, he had been interrogated at the DGS by Commissioner Aparicio. According to Ian Gibson, \"his stubborn refusal to confess his participation in the events or, more correctly, his presence while they were being consummated, made it considerably more difficult to clarify the crime quickly\".As soon as he was informed that the body of Calvo Sotelo had been found, Judge Gómez Carbajo went to the cemetery to examine it. He checks that he has two bullet holes in the back of his head. He then went to the Pontejos barracks to inspect the van. He sees that it has been washed, but nevertheless observes that between the floorboards there are traces of blood. He orders it to be taken to the basement of the Guard Court for a detailed forensic analysis and also seizes the service book of the 2nd Company, to which Lieutenant Castillo belonged (he later verifies that the services corresponding to the night of the 12th to the 13th are not listed). He returns to the court where he is informed that no news has been received from the police as to who the perpetrators of the murder might be. He then proposes to organize a lineup with the Assault Guards of Lieutenant Castillo\\'s company and also calls to testify Lieutenants Máximo Moreno and Alfonso Barbeta (the latter, to avoid being recognized by the witnesses, removes three of those who were in van number 17 —Aniceto Castro Piñeira, Bienvenido Pérez and Ricardo Cruz Cousillos— from the list of Assault Guards who must appear in court, alleging that they are on duty). In addition to the driver Orencio Bayo, two guards are recognized by the witnesses (the two security guards, the governess, the bellboy and the doorman) and were arrested —none of them had anything to do with the crime; one of them will allege years later that he was mistaken for another one—. From the interrogation of Lieutenants Máximo Moreno and Alfonso Barbeta the judge only gets evasive answers (Ian Gibson suggests that instead of Lieutenant Moreno it could have been Captain Moreno, and that the judge was mistaken when three years later he related the facts to the judges of the General Cause). Both deny having been on duty the night before. According to Ian Gibson, \"the greatest culprit in the initial cover-up of the crime was Lieutenant Alfonso Barbeta, whose pusillanimity would become evident when he appeared before the examining magistrate... Barbeta was the one who, more than anyone else, hindered the judicial proceedings aimed at solving the crime\". In his statement in the General Cause, the guard Aniceto Castro Piñeiro, one of the three guards that Lieutenant Barbeta removed from the lineup, stated that he told them: \"Do not worry; nothing will be clarified; the Director General of Security, the Minister of the Interior and the entire Government are responsible for what happened; nothing can happen to you\". Ian Gibson wonders: \"Did Barbeta really say these words, or did Castro Piñeiro, whose life was in danger for having participated in the Calvo Sotelo affair, overburden himself by testifying before Franco\\'s judges?\" Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza does give credibility to the testimony of Aniceto Castro, \"the only right wing guard who participated in the arrest\". \"Although it cannot be ruled out that Castro invented this detail after the war, we do not think it impossible that Barbeta made such a statement, since the more supported the guardsmen involved considered themselves, the less willing they would be to relate the facts.\"At nine o\\'clock in the evening, Judge Gómez Carbajo suspends the lineup with the intention of resuming it the following day. In spite of the hour he decides to go to Calvo Sotelo\\'s home to carry out a visual inspection and interrogate the family. He speaks with the widow whose testimony coincides with what was declared by the governess and the people on duty. When he returns to the Duty Court around midnight, Supreme Court Judge Eduardo Iglesias Portal, who has been appointed by the Government as special judge in the case, is waiting for him. From that moment on this judge is the one who will be in charge of the summary of the Calvo Sotelo assassination. Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza comments that Iglesias Portal will be the judge who will preside over the trial against José Antonio Primo de Rivera.That night Luis Cuenca dined with another socialist militant in a cheap restaurant near the PSOE headquarters on Carranza Street in Madrid. When he heard the comments of some diners who had just read the special edition that the conservative evening newspaper Ya had published about the death of Calvo Sotelo he began to say: \"But you are all wrong! It was not like that! I am going to explain how it was!\". His companion finally managed to calm him down so that he would not speak.In the early morning hours of the following day, Tuesday, July 14, Antonio Piga Pascual, accompanied by three other forensic doctors, performed the autopsy on Calvo Sotelo\\'s corpse. He certified that there were two bullet holes in the occipital region produced by two shots \"fired at point-blank range, almost simultaneously\", with a \"short nine\" pistol and that the position of the assassin was \"in a posterior plane and at the level of the assaulted\". One of the projectiles was lodged in the brain and the other exited through the left orbital region. He also certified that death was instantaneous due to \"bulbar syncope of traumatic origin\" and that the corpse did not present any wound or bruise that could indicate that there had been a struggle in the van, denying a sensationalist report that appeared in the press. These same forensic experts have verified that the blood found in the van belongs to the same ABMN serological group as that of the deceased. This is the only advance in the investigation. Special Judge Iglesias Portal has not received any new information from the police nor has he initiated new proceedings. He has only issued an indictment against the driver of the van, Orencio Bayo, who was already in custody, and has met with the public prosecutor Paz Mateos, with the lieutenant prosecutor Vallés and with Commissioner Lino.When on Wednesday afternoon, the 15th, after having participated in the tense meeting of the Permanent Deputation of the Cortes, Indalecio Prieto returned to his house on Carranza Street, he found a crowd at the doors of the building. The building also housed the editorial office of El Socialista and the PSOE. Among those gathered was Fernando Condés, who, according to Stanley G. Payne, had hidden in the home of Socialist deputy Margarita Nelken. Condés greeted him and Prieto called him aside to speak with him. The Socialist leader told him: \"the summary for the death of Calvo Sotelo shows that it was you who arrested the victim\". \"I know,\" Condés replied, \"but I don\\'t care about myself anymore. Overwhelmed by shame, despair and dishonor, I am ready to take my own life\". But Prieto, who at no time encouraged him to give himself up to justice, told him: \"To commit suicide would be stupid. You will have plenty of opportunities to heroically sacrifice your life in the struggle that, inevitably, will begin soon, in days or hours.\" \"You are right,\" Condés replied. As a young Socialist witness to the scene told Ian Gibson many years later, \"Prieto made no secret of his disgust at the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. Noticing Don Inda\\'s reaction, Condés reached for his pistol with the evident intention of shooting himself. Several of those present held him down, and one of them said to him: \"But Condés, man, what madness! You did well killing Calvo Sotelo\". And then Condés calmed down a little\". According to this same witness, Condés had not taken refuge in the house of the Socialist deputy Margarita Nelken, but, together with Luis Cuenca, in the house of a mutual friend. Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza believes that Indalecio Prieto lied when in his memoirs Convulsiones de España (onvulsions of Spainh) e wrote that the meeting with Condés took place on Wednesday 15th in the afternoon, after the meeting of the Permanent Commission. He thinks that \"the interview should have been earlier.\" \"Prieto was informed from the first moment of Condés\\' involvement by both Vidarte and Zugazagoitia, but it seemed to him... unpresentable to publicly acknowledge that he knew the ins and outs of the crime before he made his speech on July 15 [at the Permanent Deputation].Two days later, Friday, July 17, the evening newspaper Heraldo de Madrid reported that the special judge Eduardo Iglesias Portal had ordered the arrest of Fernando Condés, although the censorship had concealed his name and his condition as captain of the Civil Guard —according to the summary, the widow of Calvo Sotelo had recognized him in a photograph shown to her as one of the persons who had raided her house—. The newspaper also reported that the previous day the special judge had been in the Model Prison to carry out \"several examinations and confrontations in the presence of the Attorney General of the Republic, and as a result of this work the conviction of the innocence of the two Assault Guards who since last Monday had been detained and held incommunicado was acquired. On the contrary, the situation of the driver [Orencio Bayo Cambronero] is more and more compromised. Once again, he has been recognized by the guards who were on duty at the door of Mr. Calvo Sotelo\\'s house, by a maid, the doorman of the estate and other people. Notwithstanding these accusations, the driver persists in his denial, but the special judge has issued against him an indictment and imprisonment\". The newspaper also reported that \"as a result of the recent actions, several people have been placed at the disposal of the special judge\", but the censorship had eliminated the rest of the news item, so it was not possible to know who they were. At that time the judge had also agreed to the search and capture of José del Rey —which would never be achieved— and the arrest of three more Assault Guards (Tomás Pérez Figuero, who had helped Bayo to clean the blood stains from the van; Bienvenido Pérez Rojo, who had participated in the expedition commanded with Condés; and Antonio San Miguel Fernández, who had not actually intervened in the crime). That same morning of Friday the 17th the special judge and the public prosecutor of the Republic were optimistic about the progress of the investigation and that \"it would not be difficult to find out who were the authors of the kidnapping and the crime\". That same afternoon the coup d\\'état of July 1936 began in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco.Condés was never arrested and no arrest warrant was ever issued for Luis Cuenca, the perpetrator of the crime, and for the other three members of the socialist militias that accompanied him. As soon as the civil war began, Cuenca and Condés were named officers of the militias that left Madrid to fight in the battle of Guadarrama —apparently Condés had previously participated in the Siege of the Montaña barracks— and there they fell in combat (Cuenca died on July 22 trying to take Somosierra together with other comrades of \"La Motorizada\"; Condés died a week later after being wounded on July 26 near Somosierra, also fighting with \"La Motorizada\", and received a multitudinous burial; his funeral oration was pronounced by the socialist deputy Margarita Nelken: \"We needed Fernando Condés for the day of the triumph. Those of us who had the good fortune of knowing him intimately know how useful he would have been to us. Fernando has left us, but he will always be among us\"; in addition, the General Headquarters of the Popular Militias was named after him). The other three socialists implicated in the assassination (Francisco Ordóñez, Santiago Garcés Arroyo and Federico Coello, were also assigned to relevant posts in the Republican forces. Garcés became head of the Military Intelligence Service, Ordóñez head of the State Information Service and Coello commander of Military Health. Lieutenant Máximo Moreno, who was suspected of having participated in the attack, but no evidence was found so he was not prosecuted, died on September 22, 1936, after his plane crashed (he committed suicide rather than fall into the hands of Franco\\'s Moorish troops). The Republicans managed to rescue the corpse —it was said that his testicles had been cut off— and the burial, which was celebrated in Madrid, was as multitudinous as that of Condés. The driver Bayo Cambronero was released on July 25, returning to the service of the Mobile Park of the Assault Guard. The Assault Guard José del Rey, whose arrest had been ordered, was never captured by the judicial authorities in Madrid. He marched to Toledo at the head of a hundred militiamen to participate in the Siege of the Alcázar in Toledo and later was at the head of various units of the Popular Army of the Republic, reaching the rank of commander. Lieutenant Alfonso Barbeta was imprisoned for the harangue he made to the guards of Lieutenant Castillo\\'s company on the night of the 12th, but was released on August 8. On the same date the guards Tomás Pérez, Antonio San Miguel and Bienvenido Pérez Rojo were also released.. On July 25, a week after the beginning of the war, a group of ten or twelve socialist militiamen burst into the headquarters of the Supreme Court and at gunpoint seized the case file on the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. They came close to shooting Special Judge Iglesias Portal, but his police escort prevented it. According to Ian Gibson, the militiamen were friends of Captain Fernando Condés and belonged to \"La Motorizada\", \"eager to destroy the evidence against him in the case file. The stolen documents were immediately burned by the militiamen...\". The special judge resigned because of what had happened, but the Supreme Court\\'s Governing Chamber did not accept it and ordered him to reconstruct the stolen summary \"in the average and form that the present circumstances permit\". It was an almost impossible mission because, as Ian Gibson pointed out, \"many witnesses were already outside Madrid, fighting in the Sierra and on other fronts. Others had fled, or were hiding in the capital. Others had died, or would die soon, as was the case of Cuenca and Condés. And above all there was the fact that Spain was already immersed in a terrible civil war, one of the main causes of which, in the opinion of the left, was Calvo Sotelo himself\". The court officer Emilio Macarrón, who confronted the militiamen to try to prevent them from taking the case, declared before the judges of the General Cause that \"when the National Movement began on July 18, 1936, judicial work was almost impossible, since the mere fact of naming Mr. Calvo Sotelo or speaking of the investigation of the case for his assassination produced indignation and excitement in the people of the left wing\".In spite of everything, an attempt was made to reconstruct the summary based on Emilio Macarrón\\'s recollections of the proceedings that had been carried out up to July 25. And others were also included, such as a new statement taken from Assault Lieutenant Alfonso Barbeta, who stated that he gathered the guards of Lieutenant Castillo\\'s company to tell them \"to be resigned to what had happened\" and that he had no participation in the assassination of Calvo Sotelo \"nor does he know who carried it out\". Macarrón\\'s document and the rest of the documents of the reconstructed summary disappeared or were lost during or after the war. They reappeared in 1970 and were incorporated into Franco\\'s General Cause. On October 7, 1936, the General Directorate of Security informed Judge Iglesias Portal that it had discovered the perpetrators of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. According to the DGS, the \"perpetrator\" had been Captain Angel Cuenca Gómez  and the \"instigator\" Captain Fernando Condés, but neither of them could be arrested because they had died. The letter ended by saying: \"However, as regards the others who may have had a role in the matter, efforts are still being made and I will inform you of any positive results\". On February 1, 1937, an order was issued to terminate the investigation in application of the amnesty which a week earlier, on January 22, had been decreed for those convicted and indicted for political and common crimes committed prior to July 15, 1936.At the end of the civil war, four of the Assault Guardsmen who were in van number 17 were arrested and interrogated by Franco\\'s judges: Aniceto Castro Piñeiro, Bienvenido Pérez Rojo, Orencio Bayo Cambronero (the driver) and José del Rey. The latter, tried and condemned to death for the assassination of Calvo Sotelo, was executed by garrote vil in 1943. Del Rey exonerated the rest of the guards in his statement: \"The guardsmen occupying the van were unaware of the service to be performed. They then went to Velázquez Street and stopped in front of a house, at the door of which there were two Security Guards. Then they found out that Don José Calvo Sotelo lived there\". Commander Ricardo Burillo, head of the Group of Assault Guards of Pontejos, was also condemned to death in a court martial and executed for being considered one of those directly responsible for the death of Calvo Sotelo, \"an absolutely unfounded charge\", according to Ian Gibson. The driver Bayo Cambronero was condemned to death, but the death penalty was commuted to thirty years in prison. He spent seven or eight years in Porlier prison and was later released.Ian Gibson concludes: \"at the end of the war, then, that crime had not been thoroughly investigated. Nor did Franco\\'s judges succeed in clearing it up\". Gibson points out that there is no evidence that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was planned before the attack on Lieutenant Castillo, nor that the Republican Government was implicated. An assessment that is shared by historians such as Hugh Thomas: \"the possibility of a premeditated assassination cannot be totally excluded, but certainly the government was not implicated in it.\" What there is doubt about, as Hugh Thomas warns, is whether the assassination was premeditated or was a spontaneous action by Luis Cuenca. After the exhaustive research he carried out for his book La noche en que mataron a Calvo Sotelo (The night Calvo Sotelo was killed), published in 1982, Gibson believes that there is no doubt that it was premeditated. He provides as evidence, first of all, the letter that the then artillery lieutenant Urbano Orad de la Torre sent in 1978 to the newspaper El País in which he stated that in a meeting of UMRA officers, to which he also belonged, it was decided to assassinate a prominent right wing leader in retaliation for the murder of Lieutenant Castillo, also a member of the UMRA, and in fulfillment of the threat that Orad de la Torre himself had made to the members of the right wing Spanish Military Union after the murder of Captain Carlos Faraudo, also a member of the UMRA. Secondly, Gibson considers that the complicity of Captain Condés is proven because \"we find it quite difficult to believe that, upon hearing the shots fired by the captain of the Civil Guard, he did not immediately order the van to stop.\" \"Overwhelmed by the death of his friend Castillo and convinced of the imminence of the \"fascist\" uprising, would it be surprising that he agreed with Luis Cuenca, a well-known gunman, so that the latter would carry out the fatal shots, while he directed the operation? It seems to us no, just as it seems to us that the other socialist occupants of the van did not know what was going to happen,\" states Ian Gibson. Reactions. Response of Casares Quiroga\\'s Government. The government began its meeting at ten o\\'clock in the morning at the headquarters of the Presidency. At that time the body of Calvo Sotelo had not yet been found, but as soon as Casares Quiroga received the news —he commented to the military aide who gave it to him: \"What a mess they have gotten us into\"—, he contacts the president of the Cortes to propose to suspend their sessions for at least a week until tempers calm down and to avoid the risk of incidents, in which Diego Martínez Barrio agrees completely (among other reasons because to avoid serious altercations the deputies would have to be searched, since many of them used to go armed to the Congress). In fact, the president of the Cortes informed him that he had already contacted the various parliamentary groups and that they had given their agreement, except for the CEDA, which wanted an ordinary session to be held to deal with what had happened (the monarchists also rejected the suspension, but not outright). Another of the initiatives taken by Casares Quiroga is to request the presence in the Council of Ministers of the Attorney General of the Republic and the Undersecretary of Justice, Jerónimo Gomáriz, to consult them about the two possible candidates for special judges that he intends to appoint to take charge of the respective investigations of Lieutenant Castillo and Calvo Sotelo.Around two o\\'clock in the afternoon the government meeting was suspended until six o\\'clock. On the way out, the ministers —\"with countenances whose gravity accentuates their circumspect sadness\"— are besieged with questions by the journalists, but the only one who makes a brief statement is that of Enrique Ramos: \"As you will understand, we have examined the execrable events which we all regret and which, of course, have given rise to the adoption of various measures and to the judicial action which has already begun, with the appointment of two special judges. The Government has not yet compiled all the data. When we have complete information, the Government will provide a detailed note explaining the event\". President Casares Quiroga, for his part, evaded the journalists\\' questions and referred them to the explanations that could be given by the Minister of the Interior, \"who had gone at that moment to the Ministry to be duly informed\". The Minister of the Interior had just told them: \"I do not yet have an account of the event, because I have not yet been able to take care of it\".The afternoon newspapers hit the streets with blank spaces which have been suppressed by censorship. The government, under the state of alarm which has been in force since the February elections, has decided to redouble its censorship to avoid the use of the word \"assassination\" to describe the death of Calvo Sotelo and to prevent the intervention of the forces of law and order in the death of Calvo Sotelo. However, the conservative newspaper Ya has managed to launch an extraordinary edition that has escaped the censorship control. On its front page there is a big headline informing about the death of Calvo Sotelo and on its inside pages there is abundant information about what happened (it was said that among the perpetrators of the crime there were Assault Guards and a captain of the Civil Guard, whose name was unknown). The government ordered the police to collect all the copies (but many had already been sold, as the success of this special edition of Ya was extraordinary) and then decreed its indefinite suspension under the accusation of having spread false news about the death of Calvo Sotelo —when two journalists from Ya get the Minister of the Interior to receive them to ask for the suspension to be lifted, Juan Moles tells them that when he gave them permission to publish the special edition by telephone, he did not authorize them to say that the crime had been committed by Assault Guards—. The government did the same with the also conservative newspaper La Época, because it considered it a provocation that its director José Ignacio Escobar, Marquis of Las Marismas, had refused to publish it on the streets when the censorship prohibited him from using the term \"murder\". La Época would never reappear, after almost a century of existence. El Día in Alicante and El Lunes in Oviedo were also suspended for evading censorship.Early in the evening, when the second part of the Council of Ministers\\' meeting, which had resumed at six o\\'clock in the afternoon, ended, a brief note was issued. Instead of including a resounding condemnation of the assassination of one of the two main opposition leaders and committing to arrest and bring to justice the culprits —neither Luis Cuenca nor Fernando Condés were ever arrested—, the note limits itself to condemning and equating (which Gil-Robles complained about) the assassinations of both Calvo Sotelo and Lieutenant Castillo (\"The Council of Ministers, in view of the acts of violence which have culminated in the death of the Security officer Mr. Castillo and the deputy to Cortes Mr. José Calvo Sotelo, facts of notorious gravity, and for the execration of which it must formulate the most sincere and ardent protests, it believes it is appropriate to make a public statement to the effect that it will immediately proceed with the greatest energy and the clearest severity, within the precepts of the law of Public Order, to take all those measures demanded by the need to maintain the spirit of coexistence among Spaniards and the elementary respect for the rights of human life\") and to inform of the appointment of a special judge for each case, both magistrates of the Supreme Court (Enrique Iglesias Portal for that of Calvo Sotelo and Sánchez Orbeta for that of Castillo). According to Luis Romero, it seems to be a note of circumstances (\"Anodyne note\", Gil-Robles would call it) which \"does not respond to the gravity of the facts\" and which does not go to the bottom of the problem (it is limited to announcing that all the resources of the Law of Public Order will be applied \"wherever the evil takes place and whatever the affiliation of its authors or its inspirers\"). Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza shares this assessment: \"the note given to the press could not have been more disheartening for those who expected a swift reaction from the Executive, because instead of facing the exceptional seriousness of the case, the Government drafted a bland text in which the deaths of Calvo Sotelo and Castillo were equated, assassinations which from a humanitarian point of view were equally reprehensible, but which evidently did not have the same political relevance\". In the only paragraph of the note that seems to depart from this general tone of circumstances it is stated:. There is no idea, principle or doctrine that deserves respect when those who claim to profess them resort to procedures at odds with the most elementary consideration for the existence of citizens.... The note ended as follows:. Unquestionably, there is a great majority of Spaniards who love republican legality, who are not frightened by the progress of the legislative provisions, and who contemplate with tranquility any work of social justice. These Spaniards only wish that the work be executed in peace, and that its result be appreciated as a contribution to the progress of national life. It is to their serenity that the Government turns in these hours in which in our hands, in the hands of all, is the deposit of our civilization, and counting on this indispensable assistance, it has the evidence that it will succeed in imposing the law on everyone, so that the disturbing work of so many exalted ones does not triumph over the design of the Republic.. According to Luis Romero, \"the Government, which has lost control of the situation and is aware of its own weakness, is unable to regain the initiative. For the moment it has relieved itself on the duty judge and now appoints... a special judge to hear the case and, to reestablish the balance and make it clear that the death of Calvo Sotelo was a consequence of that of Lieutenant Castillo, it appoints... another magistrate to clarify this crime\". Gabriele Ranzato considers that the government made a terrible mistake. \"Casares had the imperative to issue statements condemning the crime and, above all, to take initiatives to prosecute the culprits even more vigorously than he would normally have taken in the case of any other magnicide. Not so much or not only to remove suspicion, but to try to contain the wave of indignation that this death was provoking and that, as it was not difficult to understand, was taking the country towards the precipice\". Furthermore, the absence of a categorical statement by the President of the Government could reinforce the idea spread in right wing circles that he personally was behind the assassination, based on the alleged death threat that Casares Quiroga had made to Calvo Sotelo on June 16 in the Cortes (\"It is lawful for me to say after what Your Honor has done today before Parliament, of any case that might occur, which will not occur, I will hold Your Honor responsible before the country.\"), although the following day no newspaper interpreted Casares Quiroga\\'s words in that sense. Ranzato also considers the silence of the President of the Republic Manuel Azaña a mistake. Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, for his part, considers that \"the President of the Republic did not know, as he had not known in the last few months, how to rise to the circumstances\".At the meeting of the Permanent Deputation which took place on the morning of Wednesday the 15th, the leader of the CEDA, José María Gil-Robles, made a harsh criticism of the government\\'s response to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo:. The Government has nothing else to do but to publish an anodyne note, equating cases which cannot be equated and saying that the Courts of Justice must take up the matter, as if it were a trivial thing that a political leader, that a minority leader, that a member of Parliament should be snatched from his home at night by agents of the authority, using those instruments which the Government puts in their hands to protect the citizens; That they snatch him away in a van, that they go on a rampage, that they take him to the door of the cemetery, that they kill him there and throw him like a bundle on one of the tables of the morgue? Is that not serious at all?. According to Gabriele Ranzato, \"that murder seemed destined to go unpunished, since both the government and the judiciary, and any other authority in charge of the inquiries, were showing slowness and passivity in the pursuit of the culprits, making only a few arrests of secondary participants in the \"punitive expedition\", while the main culprits, whose identity was not difficult to know, had been left at large\". Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza holds a similar position when he considers \"evident that in the leaders of the Popular Front the fundamental concern after the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was not to find his assassins, but to crush the uprising which after his death they believed inevitable\". Luis Romero, for his part, has stressed that the actions of the Government fed the conviction of the right wing (and of other sectors) that he had ordered it or had been an accomplice in the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. \"The clumsiness of the Government, the intervention of uniformed guards and the van used, the slow reaction of Alonso Mallol, the previous mistakes related to the change of escort, and those impolitic and imprudent words of Casares in the session of June 16th, added to the disconcerting way in which censorship was exercised, the physical concealment of those responsible and other contributing causes, have led not only Calvo Sotelo\\'s co-religionists and other right wing militants to that conviction, but also wide areas of the scarcely politicized opinion. It is true that the right wing exploits the unfortunate event, but it is also true that they firmly believe that the impulse —the order— came from above; and each one places the vertex of the homicidal pyramid where their antipathies become more ostensible. There are those who go so far as to involve Azaña\".The lack of initiative of the government to condemn outright and clarify the assassination of Calvo Sotelo may have been due to the enormous pressure it received from the workers\\' parties and organizations integrated in the Popular Front, outraged by the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo, to act against the right wing. The Socialists, for their part, according to Alfonso Bullón de Mendonza, were very interested in preventing the details of the assassination from becoming known, because if they came to light \"the image of the party would be very damaged\" (\"one of the chiefs of La Motorizada had led the group that appeared at Calvo Sotelo\\'s house and... one of Prieto\\'s bodyguards had assassinated the monarchist leader\"). Shortly before midnight on Monday the 13th, prominent leaders of the PSOE (Indalecio Prieto, Juan Simeón Vidarte), the UGT (Manuel Lois Fernández), the JSU (Santiago Carrillo), the PCE (Vicente Uribe) and the Casa de Pueblo in Madrid (Edmundo Domínguez) presented themselves at the Ministry of War, where the President of the Government Casares Quiroga had his office (since in addition to the Presidency he held that portfolio), the JSU (Santiago Carrillo), the PCE (Vicente Uribe) and the Casa del Pueblo in Madrid (Edmundo Domínguez) to offer him all their support if the military uprising that everyone thought was imminent took place, which Casares Quiroga was grateful for, but he gave no importance to the rumors about the possible military coup. Hours later, in the early hours of Tuesday the 14th, these organizations (the CNT had not been invited to the meeting they held) made public a joint note, which according to Luis Romero \"ties the hands of the ministers a little in the face of the clarification of the facts and conditions, to some extent, their actions in the face of them\":. Knowing the intentions of the reactionary elements who are enemies of the Republic and of the proletariat, the political and trade union elements represented by the signatories have united and have established an absolute and unanimous agreement in offering the Government the support and help of the masses who are concerned for everything that means defense of the regime and resistance against everything that can be done against it.. In the action against the rightists the Government did comply. Nearly two hundred Falangists and rightists were arrested and the Madrid headquarters of Spanish Renovation, Calvo Sotelo\\'s party, were closed. To give the \"impression of strength and fairness\" he also closed the headquarters of the National Confederation of Labor which at that time was engaged in a fierce struggle with the socialist union UGT over the construction strike in Madrid which had been going on for over a month. The CNT organ Solidaridad Obrera complained about this in its Thursday 16 edition, which hit the streets with the front page headlines censored and with a third of the editorial blank: \"Enough already: only madmen and agents provocateurs can establish points of contact between fascism and anarchism! [...] This undignified and ignoble game which weakens the forces of resistance and attack on fascism coinciding in the struggle against the common enemy cannot be allowed... Let the Socialists and Communists keep an eye on the panorama of Spain, and they will see if it suits them to denigrate, insult and discredit the CNT.\"Furthermore, taking advantage of the state of alarm, the government strictly prohibited open-air demonstrations and meetings and accentuated to the maximum the censorship of the press, even for the speeches of the deputies in Cortes who until then had enjoyed immunity. Likewise, the government sent a circular on the same 13th to all the civil governors in which it urged them to be alert \"on the occasion of the death of Calvo Sotelo\":. On the occasion of the death of Calvo Sotelo, there is news that elements of political affinities will try at any moment to make the subversive movement break out. Get in touch and be in constant contact with civil guard chiefs and forces in which you have absolute confidence, control roads, railroads and accesses, detaining elements that you suspect to be emissaries or liaison agents and immediately communicate to this Ministry activities that you observe and details that come to your knowledge.. Stanley G. Payne goes much further on the importance of the pressure from the left to explain the inaction of the Government and directly accuses the Socialist Indalecio Prieto, his \"number one ally\", of having blocked with his \"veto\" \"an investigation of the crime\" that the Government \"had begun\". \"Prieto and his followers continued to hide the assassins of Calvo Sotelo, and there are testimonies of his personal intervention to put an end to the judicial investigation\", Payne affirms. In reality there is only one testimony, that of Assault Lieutenant Alfredo León Lupión, who in 1981 told Ian Gibson —to whose book La noche en que mataron a Calvo Sotelo (1982) Payne refers— that in the meeting that Prieto and other leaders of the left held with the President of the Government around midnight on Monday the 13th, Casares Quiroga informed them of his intention to arrest all the officers of the Group of Assault Guards of Pontejos (the commander, the four captains and the seven lieutenants, one of them León Lupión himself) \"because it is a crime that cannot be hidden\", to which Prieto replied: \"If you commit this nonsense, I assure you that the Socialist minority will leave the Congress\". And then Casares Quiroga said: \"Very well, very well, but the Assault officer who appears with the slightest guilt, that one is arrested\". Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza also uses this testimony from Gibson\\'s book —which he also quotes— to support his conjecture that \"it is even possible that [Prieto] obstructed the investigation\". And then Bullón de Mendoza refers to the interpretation of this fact by the revisionist Pío Moa, who has gone so far as to affirm that Indalecio Prieto was behind the assassination of Calvo Sotelo: \"If true, this relationship would prove that if the government of Casares Quiroga did not take more spectacular measures against the assassins of Calvo Sotelo it was because it was prevented by pressure from the PSOE, and in such a case Prieto\\'s responsibility in the unleashing of the civil war would be hardly exaggerated, since he would have prevented the only indicative to the right that Casares Quiroga was willing to make.\" In reality what Lieutenant León Lupión intended by relating the confrontation between Casares Quiroga and Prieto was to demonstrate that the government was not involved in the assassination. \"A man who takes this position [Casares Quiroga] is not a man committed to the crime,\" he had also told Ian Gibson, who, on the other hand, makes no interpretation of what the lieutenant has told him.Casares Quiroga even presented his resignation to the President of the Republic, Azaña, but the latter did not accept it, alleging that to do so would be like acknowledging that he had had some responsibility in the crime. Azaña did not heed the advice given to him by Diego Martínez Barrio, President of the Cortes, that he should immediately change the government, that he should act against the right and against the extreme left \"with harsh sanctions that would show the recovery of all the levers of power. Perhaps we will not dissipate the storm, but we will succeed in driving it away\". Azaña replied: \"I know that I must change the Government... But we must wait. If I were to accept the resignation that Casares has presented to me, it would be as much as handing over his honor to the slander that accuses him. It is not possible for him to jump from power pushed by the assassination of Calvo Sotelo\". In the meeting held by the Government in the National Palace at noon on Thursday 16th presided over by Azaña, some ministers expressed themselves in favor of giving entry into the cabinet to some centrist personality in order to contribute to the appeasement that the country needed. They also expressed their concern for the infiltration of the State apparatus, as had been made clear by the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. Response from the left. Unlike most of the rest of the leaders of the left, Diego Martínez Barrio, president of the Cortes, was completely shocked. This is how Luis Romero highlights it: \"leaving aside relatives, friends and co-religionists, one of the people who was most affected by what happened and the circumstances that aggravated it was Diego Martínez Barrio, despite the fact that the political distances between him and the deceased were unbridgeable...\". Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza notes the same thing with nuances: he was \"one of the few leaders of the left who seems to have sincerely felt sorry for the homicide\". As soon as he heard the news of the discovery of Calvo Sotelo\\'s body he asked the Count of Vallellano to go immediately to his house. When the latter arrived, accompanied by other deputies of the monarchist minority, Martínez Barrio told him in tears and in a broken voice: \"For the same reasons as you and many others that will not escape your perspicacity, no one but me deplores this stain that falls on the Republic, and whose consequences no one can foresee to what extent they will reach\". A journalist of the Catholic newspaper El Debate who spoke with him shortly afterwards wrote that he was \"truly overwhelmed by the event\".Martínez Barrio did not put on the same level the assassination of Calvo Sotelo, whose figure he publicly praised, and that of Lieutenant Castillo, as did most of the rest of the leaders of the left, and refrained from establishing a causal relationship between the two crimes. He was also one of the few politicians of the Popular Front who was aware that the assassination and its circumstances made it necessary to change the policy followed until then by the left. This is how he put it privately to the President of the Republic, Manuel Azaña. He told him that he believed it was necessary to form a new government ready to impose \"harsh sanctions that would show the recovery of all the levers of power\". In order to avoid breaking the Popular Front Martínez Barrio did not clearly state what he thought, but he did so in a veiled way when on the night of the 13th he told journalists (which also implied a criticism of the government): \"It is not possible for citizens to see that the State does not guarantee their security. We must all do our part to put an end to the situation that this event reveals...\". The newspaper La Vanguardia in its edition of the following day put it more clearly: \"Either a guiding Government finally rises in Spain, a Government that truly governs, imposing itself and disarming everyone, or the torrential waters of anarchy will swell and rise until they submerge us in a wave of barbarism\". For his part, Antoni Rovira i Virgili wrote in La Humanitat, the press organ of the Republican Left of Catalonia: \"Let the rulers vigorously enforce compliance with the laws. But let there be order in the streets, in the workplaces and in the homes. Let there be an authentic Republic and not a mess with violence and the blood from crimes.\" Another left wing Republican politician who was aware of the seriousness and implications of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was Mariano Ansó, who in his memoirs wrote: \"After the revolutionary movement of Catalonia and Asturias, this crime was the greatest attack committed against the Republic. When we came to know that the perpetrators were military and law enforcement officers, our indignation rose to a fever pitch. The fact that a few hours earlier Lieutenant Castillo had been vilely assassinated was of no use to us as an excuse\".The one who was able to express himself clearly, possibly because he was not part of the Popular Front coalition, was Felipe Sánchez Román, a friend of Azaña. He was the only left wing Republican politician who roundly and publicly condemned the crime —he had been a fellow student of Calvo Sotelo— saying that \"the Republic had been disgraced forever\". He was also one of the few who offered his condolences to the family. However, when another left wing Republican, Rafael Sánchez Guerra, went to Calvo Sotelo\\'s home to sign the condolence sheets that had been placed in the doorway, he was booed and rejected. For its part, the parliamentary group of Republican Left demanded that \"the extremist struggles by reprehensible and punishable procedures cease forever\". In the immediate post-war period, the socialist Julián Zugazagoitia, then editor of the newspaper El Socialista, recognized that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo had been a \"truly monstrous\" event.The pro-government Republican press highlighted the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo more than that of Calvo Sotelo, while the right wing press such as ABC and El Debate did the opposite, although in inferior conditions because the government forbade them to publish any commentary. One of the few newspapers that tried to maintain a certain balance was Ahora, which published photographs of the two victims on its front page and in the inside pages described the two deaths as \"abominable crimes\".Política, the unofficial organ of Republican Left, put on the front page in large font accompanied by an image \"The Assault Lieutenant Don José Castillo murdered by gunmen\", while dedicating a small headline at the bottom of the page to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo which read: \"Violent death of Mr. Calvo Sotelo. The monarchist leader is arrested at his home and his corpse appears in the cemetery\". In the editorial it attacks the reactionaries who await \"the occasion to make an assault on power\", but also the hotheads who apply the law of retaliation because \"they contribute to provide flags to the enemies of the regime, who, without ceasing in their tactic of error, present themselves as victims of persecution that does not exist\". El Liberal said in its editorial dedicated to the two murders: \"If they do what they do when they are in the opposition, what would they not do when they are in power? Those who, in the absence of the people\\'s suffrage, resort to violence, are incapable of governing. The Republic will follow its path, serene, unshakable, imposing by degree or by force the national will\". La Libertad wrote: \"We do not accept violence, but neither do we tolerate the murder of the people, drowning them in waves of tyranny and misery\".The socialist caballerist newspaper Claridad devoted its entire front page to the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo and the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was relegated to the last page, devoting only a few lines to it. Much further went the also caballerist El Obrero de la Tierra of July 18 —without having had time to cover in its pages the previous day\\'s uprising of the army in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco— since it justified the assassination of Calvo Sotelo by affirming that his death had been the \"logical consequence of these latest fascist criminal attacks\" carried out by \"the mercenary gangs for hire of reaction\", and then called for the organization of the \"Popular Militias\". To the cadres of the socialist militias he urged them to maintain \"constant communication among themselves to help each other and to concentrate wherever necessary in order to inexorably crush fascism, as soon as it wants to begin its announced uprising against the Republic and the workers\". If fascism triumphed, said El Obrero de la Tierra, \"blood will flow in torrents. And before that happens it is better for theirs to flow than ours\".Even more radical was the response of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), whose secretary general José Díaz, a week earlier, had already criticized the government for making \"concessions to the enemy, driven by an absurd desire for coexistence\". The PCE presented a bill on the afternoon of the 13th itself (and which was published by Mundo Obrero) which called for nothing less than the suppression of the right wing opposition (\"Article 1. All organizations of a reactionary and fascist character, such as Spanish Phalanx, Spanish Renovation, CEDA, Valencian Regional Right and those which, due to their characteristics, are akin to these, will be dissolved, and the movable and immovable property of such organizations, their leaders and inspirers will be confiscated\"), the imprisonment of their leaders (\"Art. 2. All those known for their reactionary, fascist and anti-republican activities will be imprisoned and prosecuted without bail\") and the confiscation of their press (\"Art. 3. The newspapers El Debate, Ya, Informaciones, ABC and all the reactionary press of the provinces will be confiscated by the Government\"). They \"justified\" it in the preamble of the proposal where he held responsible \"the reactionary and fascist elements, declared enemies of the Republic\", for the \"assassination of the best defenders of the people and of the regime\" (in reference to Lieutenant Castillo) and accused them of \"conspiring against the security\" of \"the people\".For its part, the PSOE, whose Executive Committee was controlled by the centrists of Indalecio Prieto, called a meeting of the workers\\' forces which was attended by the PCE, the Casa del Pueblo of Madrid, the JSU and the UGT. In the joint note which was made public in the early hours of Tuesday, July 14, support was offered to the government for the \"defense of the regime\". In the morning an article of his entitled \"Apostillas a unos sucesos sangrientos\" (Apostilles to some bloody events) appeared in El Liberal of Bilbao, owned by Prieto, which was reproduced the following day, in whole or in part, by all the pro-government press. The article, which according to Luis Romero impressed \"the readers of both sides and the public in general\", began by recounting the series of \"political crimes\" which of one kind or another had been taking place in Madrid since the incidents during the funeral of Anastasio de los Reyes, praising in passing the actions of Lieutenant Castillo, and then called for an end to them: \"I simply say that, for the honor of us all, this cannot continue\". He then reported on the meeting of the workers\\' organizations, stressing that they had put aside their differences to confront the \"enemy\" —\"all discord was drowned out. Facing the enemy, union,\" he wrote—. The article ended with the following warning:. If reaction dreams of a bloodless coup d\\'état, like that of 1923, it is half mistaken. If it supposes that it will find the regime defenseless, it is deluded. In order to win, it will have to leap over the human barrier that the proletarian masses will oppose it. It will be, as I have said many times, a battle to the death, because each of the two sides knows that the adversary, if he triumphs, will give him no quarter. Even if this were to happen, a decisive combat would be preferable to this continuous bloodletting.. As soon as Francisco Largo Caballero and the rest of the members of the UGT leadership who had traveled to London to attend the Socialist International Trade Union Congress arrived in Madrid that same Tuesday 14th in the afternoon, they stated that they did not express their solidarity with the joint note signed by the member of the executive that had remained in Spain. The reason was that the caballerists did not recognize the PSOE Executive Committee controlled by the centrists, which they considered \"factious\". They finally agreed to meet with the PSOE executive and the rest of the workers\\' organizations of the Popular Front on July 16, one day before the military uprising began, so as not to overrule their representative at the first meeting, but the UGT envoy stated that he could not make any agreement without consulting his executive. In the document which was finally approved, with the abstention of the UGT, it was urged to prepare workers\\' committees throughout Spain to organize \"popular militias\", to ask the government for weapons for them and to purge the military. The government was even offered the possibility of joining these committees —a sort of \"armed soviets\", according to Stanley G. Payne—. \"The political language of everyone had changed. Since the PSOE knew that it could not propose to the caballerists to enter the Government, they agreed, with Communist consent, to defend the Republic from exclusively workers\\' and armed organs of power. From such a proposal the State was left defenseless, because the socialists did not come to its aid by integrating into it, but they would defend it from their own organs of power, to the point that the representatives of the Government parties could participate in them, without considering that it was those governmental ones who had to demand them to defend the State within their institutions and not through parallel powers\".. The then editor of the newspaper El Socialista and deputy Julián Zugazagoitia, of the prietist sector, recalled in exile immediately after the end of the war that \"among my colleagues there was no unanimity in judging the attack. I heard from one of them the following opinion: —The death of Calvo Sotelo gives me neither sorrow nor joy. In order to condemn that attack it would be necessary that those who shot down Faraudo and Castillo had not taken place. As for the consequences that are now being talked about, I do not think we should fear them. The Republic has the proletariat on its side, and that adhesion makes it, if not untouchable, then invincible\". The same confidence had been shown a few days earlier by the leader of the radical sector of the PSOE, Francisco Largo Caballero, who at a rally held in Madrid before traveling to London had said: \"If they want to give themselves the pleasure of staging a coup d\\'etat by surprise, let them do it... The working class cannot be defeated.\" During his stay in London, Largo Caballero had reiterated in a statement to the News Chronicle (the article was titled: \"Interview with one of the most important men in Spain today, who perhaps will become as famous as Lenin\") the political strategy he had conceived since he agreed to join the Popular Front: \"When it [the Republican Government] fails we will replace it and then it will be our program and not theirs that will be carried out.\" He also gave another interview to the Daily Express in which he was called the \"Spanish Lenin\". The main ideologist of Caballeroism Luis Araquistain wrote in a letter to his daughter (or his wife) as soon as he learned of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo: \"I believe that Caballero would have to be the president or we would not accept anything else. [...] It seems to me that we are entering the most dramatic phase of the Republic. Either our dictatorship comes or the other\".The funeral of Lieutenant Castillo, which took place in the civil cemetery of Madrid on the morning of Tuesday, July 14, was a great demonstration of the strength of the workers\\' organizations. \"The threat of an uprising against the Republic weighed that morning on all the spirits,\" recalled many years later a young medical student, a Socialist sympathizer, who attended the funeral. When the funeral was over and those who had participated in it left the civil cemetery they ran into those who were attending the burial of Calvo Sotelo in the East cemetery. \"The avenue of Daroca [which connects both cemeteries] was crowded with people from both sides. There were confrontations, shouts, threats, raised fists and Roman salutes. The atmosphere could not have been more tense.\" That same night Indalecio Prieto wrote an article entitled \"La España actual reflejada en el cementerio\" (Current Spain reflected in the cemetery) which was published the following day by his newspaper El Liberal of Bilbao. In it he said:. Our differences are so profound that neither the living nor the dead can be together. It seems as if Spaniards, even after death, continue to hate each other. The corpses of Don José del Castillo and Don José Calvo Sotelo could not be exhibited in the same morgue. If they had been put together, their respective supporters would have fiercely attacked them, and the deposit would have lacked space for the exhibition of new victims. Commotion on the right (and in the liberal sectors) and funeral. The shock —and indignation— caused by the assassination of Calvo Sotelo spread throughout Spain (\"the Spanish middle class was stupefied by this assassination of the leader of the parliamentary opposition by members of the regular police, even though they might suspect that the victim had been involved in a conspiracy against the State,\" comments Hugh Thomas), and not only among the conservative sectors. The family received countless telegrams of condolences from all over, funerals were held in many localities, black ribbons were hung, and thousands of people came to the doorway of Calvo Sotelo\\'s home at 89 Velázquez Street or to the headquarters of Spanish Renovation to sign on the sheets of paper that had been prepared to protest the assassination. On them they wrote phrases such as \"Your blood will save Spain!\", \"Now more than ever, long live Calvo Sotelo!\" or the Falangist \"¡Arriba España!\". The conservative press, both in the capital and outside Madrid, dedicated ample space to the news, although with the limitations imposed by the censorship ordered by the government. El Pueblo Manchego, a Catholic newspaper of Ciudad Real, published an editorial on July 15 in which it asked \"What is going to happen here?\" and affirmed: \"We are at war. Whoever doubts it does not know how to see or understand the realities of Spain\". He then raised the need to form a \"National Front\". \"It is so because the life of Spain is seriously threatened\" and \"to resist the revolutionary push... and to defeat it\". The Bar Associations of Madrid and Barcelona agreed on protest letters (the lawyers who signed them would be \"purged\" by the Republican authorities during the civil war). The Bar Association of Zaragoza sent a telegram to the family of Calvo Sotelo, signed by Dean Monterde, which read: \"Dismayed by the monstrous murder of a distinguished, glorious Spaniard, virtuous companion all his life, I protest intense indignation, impious, cruel national shame. May God mercifully welcome the martyred soul of the homeland, which may serve as an example to its last defenders\").The liberal sectors that had supported the Republic were also shocked, especially by the lack of response from the government. Gregorio Marañón, one of the former members of the Association in the Service of the Republic, wrote to Marcelino Domingo on the 16th: \"The Government gives the impression of incredible leniency, it makes us who fought against the Monarchy blush and outraged. [...] Spain is ashamed and indignant, as it has never been before\" (italics in the original). Among many centrist or conservative leaders the idea was installed that the state was not capable of controlling its security forces, even if it wanted to do so. \"Lerroux, or Cambó, or even Gil-Robles, thought that from then on they could not be loyal to a state that could not guarantee their lives. The president of the association of Catholic students, Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez, who had previously defended the line of non-violence, decided that St. Thomas would have approved a rebellion considering it just.\" Alejandro Lerroux wrote in his memoirs: \"By leaving the crime unpunished they [the members of the government] had demonstrated, at least, their impotence to repress and punish it\". The former radical minister Salazar Alonso wrote in a letter to a friend on the same day, July 13: \"The vile assassination of Calvo Sotelo is confirmed. How appalling! But before this crime we must react like men...!\"From the prison in Alicante where he was imprisoned, the leader of the Spanish Phalanx of the JONS José Antonio Primo de Rivera used the assassination of Calvo Sotelo as justification for the coup d\\'état on the same day, July 17, when it had begun (two days earlier he had sent a letter to General Mola urging him to begin the uprising and had drawn up a manifesto for when it took place which began: \"A group of Spaniards, some soldiers and others civilian men, does not want to witness the total dissolution of the homeland. It rises today against the treacherous, inept, cruel and unjust Government that leads it to ruin...\"):. We have been enduring five months of opprobrium. A sort of factious gang has taken over power. Since its advent there has been no quiet hour, no respectable home, no secure job, no sheltered life... And if anything was missing for the spectacle to reach its last tenebrous quality, some Government agents have assassinated in Madrid an illustrious Spaniard, entrusted to the honor and the public function of those who were driving him. The scoundrelly ferocity of this last deed is unparalleled in Modern Europe and can be compared with the blackest pages of the Russian Cheka. [...] This is the spectacle of our Homeland at the right time when the circumstances of the world call it to fulfill once again a great destiny.. A similar reaction was that of the ex-king Alfonso XIII, who in a letter to the Count of Los Andes, one of the royalist liaisons in the coup d\\'état that was being forged, wrote to him:. Calvo Sotelo is the premeditated death obeying a plan with all the signs of complicity of the Government. [...] If now the Army does not start reacting to a crime committed by one of its officers by using force, it seems to me that we can prepare to see all those who can do something fall one after another.. The burial was held on the 14th at five o\\'clock in the afternoon in the East cemetery, only a few hours after the burial of Lieutenant Castillo in the civil cemetery of Madrid, nearby. Calvo Sotelo\\'s corpse had been shrouded in the Franciscan habit, as he had disposed in his will, and the lower part of the coffin was covered with a monarchist flag. The guard of honor was formed by young people from the different Youth of the right wing parties. Along with the widow and the rest of the family, the leaders and deputies of the right wing organizations (José María Gil-Robles, Antonio Goicoechea, Melquíades Álvarez, Joan Ventosa, José Martínez de Velasco, Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, among many others) were present, as well as prominent members of the aristocracy and the upper classes. Also, some high-ranking military officers, such as General Kindelán. The rosary was prayed while the coffin was carried to the grave. The funeral was attended by thousands of militants and right wing sympathizers, many of whom gave the fascist salute. The vice president, the first secretary and the Senior Officer of the Cortes attempted to attend the funeral, but when they arrived at the cemetery they were booed and almost assaulted by many of the attendees, among them, according to Hugh Thomas, \"very well-dressed ladies, who shouted that they wanted nothing to do with parliamentarians\", and they had to leave. Some shouted \"Death to the parliament!\" There were also cheers for the Civil Guard, which had been deployed in and around the cemetery. Among the many wreaths accompanying the coffin was one commissioned by former King Alfonso XIII. Antonio Goicoechea, leader of Spanish Renovation, delivered the farewell speech to the deceased (censorship prohibited its reproduction by newspapers):. We do not offer you that we will pray to God for you; we ask you to pray for us. Before that flag placed like a cross on your chest, before God who hears us and sees us, we solemnly swear to consecrate our lives to a triple task: to imitate your example, to avenge your death and to save Spain, which is all one and the same; because to save Spain will be to avenge your death, and to imitate your example will be the surest way to save Spain.. After the funeral, which the centrist socialist Julián Zugazagoitia considered \"a declaration of war to the State\", many of the people leaving the cemetery paraded a raised arm and some sang the Falangist anthem Cara al Sol (Facing the Sun). A part of them, among which young people predominate, decided to go in demonstration to the center of Madrid. At the Plaza de Manuel Becerra, a detachment of the Assault Guard cut them off. There were charges, races and incidents, but the demonstrators managed to reorganize and continue advancing along Alcalá Street. Many had been searched by the guards to make sure they were not carrying weapons. When they reached the intersection with General Pardiñas Street —or the intersection with Goya Street, according to other versions— a shot rang out and immediately the guards, who were in one or two vans, descended and began to shoot. Two of the demonstrators were killed and several were seriously wounded. The incidents continue in the center of the capital. In Montera Street one person is seriously wounded by a gunshot. According to various newspapers, the final toll is between two and seven dead and numerous wounded\". No guard was hit by a gunshot. This disproportionate action by the forces of public order provoked the protests of three officers of the Assault Guard, who were arrested for this reason. Others demanded a more thorough investigation of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo and even came close to mutiny. Also arrested by their officers were some non-commissioned officers and Assault Guards of the Pontejos Barracks, most belonging to the 2nd Company (Lieutenant Castillo\\'s) and the 5th Company, for showing their discontent at being blamed indiscriminately for the assassination of the monarchist leader.The following day, Wednesday 15, censorship did not prevent the monarchist newspaper ABC from publishing an obituary for the death of Calvo Sotelo which occupied the entire front page and in which the word \"assassinated\" appeared. It read: \"José Calvo Sotelo, former Minister of Finance and deputy to Cortes. He died assassinated in the early morning of July 13, 1936. RIP. His family, the national forces he represented, his friends and co-religionists, ask for a prayer for the eternal rest of his soul.\" Meeting of the Permanent Deputation of the Cortes. Both the Government and the president of the Cortes agreed that until tempers calmed down, their sessions had to be suspended. But since the CEDA was opposed, because it wanted an ordinary session to be held to discuss what had happened (\"Communicate to the perpetrators of Calvo Sotelo\\'s death that tonight I am sleeping at home, in case they want to come and assassinate me\", Gil-Robles told Martínez Barrio when he refused to suspend the Cortes; \"That is calling us assassins\", replied the latter; \"You take it wherever you want\", replied the former), it was necessary to resort to a decree of the President of the Republic Manuel Azaña who, using the prerogative granted to him by article 81 of the Constitution of 1931 (\"The President of the Republic... may suspend the ordinary sessions of the Congress in each legislature for only one month in the first period and for fifteen days in the second\") suspended them for eight days. However, the Government could not avoid the meeting of the Permanent Deputation because on July 15 the one-month term of the state of alarm expired, and this had to be renewed every thirty days. Diego Martínez Barrio, president of the Cortes, was hopeful that there would be no incidents as the number of deputies present was much smaller (twenty-two, only seven of them from the right).Around eleven thirty in the morning of Wednesday, July 15, the meeting of the Permanent Deputation began. It was surprising that the President of the Government, Santiago Casares Quiroga, was not present. In his place the Minister of State Augusto Barcia Trelles and the Minister of the Interior Juan Moles attended. After the reading of the proposal to extend the state of alarm, Martínez Barrio gave the floor to the representative of the monarchist right, Fernando Suárez de Tangil, Count of Vallellano. He read a statement that had been drafted by Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, who later affirmed that \"it was a correct statement in form, but of enormous violence\". The brutal accusation appears in the second paragraph: the assassination of Calvo Sotelo —\"honor and hope of Spain\", \"spokesman of the anguish suffered by our homeland\"— was a \"true State crime\" —the monarchists had just pointed to the Government as the instigator or accomplice of the crime, although as Sainz Rodríguez acknowledged years later he had no proof, nor did he have it then, but in spite of this the qualification of \"State crime\" was maintained during the forty years of the Franco dictatorship—.According to Ian Gibson, \"it was therefore a question of using the death of the royalist leader to further discredit a hated government. It did not matter that the assassination had not been, in reality, a State crime, that is to say, ordered by the Government. What was essential was to make people believe that it had been\". In fact, two weeks earlier, on July 1, Pedro Sainz Rodríguez in person, with the knowledge of Antonio Goicoechea and Calvo Sotelo, had signed in Rome the purchase of 43 fighter planes with their corresponding armament and ammunition (and fuel and spare parts), for a value of 39.3 million lire (616,000 pounds). Even more important than the Dragon Rapide operation, this purchase of planes from Fascist Italy was, according to Ángel Viñas, \"the most important operational contribution made by the royalists for the final preparations for the coup d\\'état\" and meant that the royalists were not preparing for a coup d\\'état, but \"to settle a short war\". These planes were the ones that made it possible for General Franco to move the Army of Africa to the peninsula, a decisive fact in his victory in the Spanish civil war.The document drafted by Sainz Rodriguez and read by the Count of Vallellano went on to say that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was a crime \"without precedent in our political history\", since \"it had been executed by the agents of authority themselves\" and then the responsibility for the \"crime of State\" was extended to all the political forces supporting the Government (recalling the threat made to Calvo Sotelo by the Socialist Ángel Galarza, but without mentioning his name): \"And this has been able to be done thanks to the atmosphere created by the incitements to violence and personal attacks against the right wing deputies which are daily uttered in Parliament. \"In the case of Calvo Sotelo, the personal attack is licit and plausible\", some have declared\". This was followed by a merciless and \"Machiavellian\" attack against the President of the Government, Casares Quiroga, after mentioning the alleged threat he had made to Calvo Sotelo in the Cortes on June 16:. Sad fate of this ruler, under whose command the agents of authority become criminals! Sometimes it is the criminal repression of Casas Viejas on some humble peasants; others, as now, attacking a patriot and distinguished politician, true national glory; it is to him who has had the sad fate of finding in honorable bodies more or less numerous nuclei of murderers.. The statement ended by announcing the withdrawal of the monarchists from the Cortes, but at the same time their commitment to \"whoever wants to save Spain\":. We cannot coexist even for a moment longer with the sponsors and moral accomplices of this act. We do not want to deceive the country and international opinion by accepting a role in the farce of pretending the existence of a civilized and normal State, when in reality since February 16 we have been living in full anarchy, under the rule of a monstrous subversion of all moral values, which has managed to place authority and justice at the service of violence and crime.. This does not mean that we are deserting our posts in the struggle, nor are we lowering the flag of our ideals. Whoever wants to save Spain and its moral heritage as a civilized people, will find us the first on the path of duty and sacrifice.. The president of the Cortes Diego Martínez Barrio asked Suárez de Tangil not to leave the room immediately because he wanted \"to make some statements regarding the content of the document which has just been read\", to which the royalist deputy agreed: \"the attentions and deference which we officially and particularly owe in this tragic case to Mr. President oblige me to comply with his instructions\". Martínez Barrio began his speech saying that he understood \"the state of pain of Mr. Suárez de Tangil and of the parliamentary representation in whose name he had just read that document\", but then he warned that after carefully examining the document he would exclude from the Journal of Sessions those statements \"which imply an exacerbation of passions, some accusations on which I do not want to go into, but that at this moment just stating them would contribute to poison the spirits even more than they are\". \"Neither Mr. Suárez de Tangil nor the representation of his groups should take it as discourtesy, lack of attention and, as far as they are human, absence of collaboration and solidarity with the pain they are experiencing, which is common to all of us, but as foresight, obligatory, much more so in someone who in these moments the circumstances have given him such bitter obligations as the ones that weigh on me\". He ended saying: \"I hope and wish that the parliamentary withdrawal of the groups of Spanish Renovation and Traditionalist, which have delegated their right to his lordship, is transitory...\". Suárez de Tangil complied with his purpose and left the room.Martínez Barrio ordered to eliminate from the Journal of Sessions the key phrase: a \"true crime of State\". And also the harsh accusations directed against the President of the Government Casares Quiroga: the sentence \"and the President of the Council has threatened Calvo Sotelo with making him responsible a priori, without further investigation, of easily foreseeable events that could take place in Spain\" is not included; and the whole paragraph which began saying \"Sad fate of this ruler...\" and ended with the sentence \"...the sad fate of finding in honorable bodies more or less numerous nuclei of murderers.\" (the whole quote in italics) is eliminated. He also deleted the reference to \"crime\" from the penultimate paragraph of the statement (in italics in the quote). Gil-Robles protested harshly and threatened to leave the Cortes: \"To cross them out [the words of Mr. Suárez de Tangil], to make sure that they do not make it into the minutes, that they are not transcribed in the Journal of Sessions, is something that means an attack on the right, which has never been unknown, of the minorities,...\".. After a brief speech by the Minister of State Augusto Barcia lamenting the death of Calvo Sotelo, the leader of the CEDA José María Gil-Robles took the floor, whose speech, according to Gabriele Ranzato, \"was, for its efficiency and eloquence, his last great service to the cause of the uprising\". His speech, according to Luis Romero, \"is aggressive and accusatory; parliamentary speaking he no longer complements Calvo Sotelo, he has merged with him\". Gil-Robles begins by denouncing that the state of alarm has been used by the government as an \"element of persecution\" against the opposition, to then dissociate himself from the accusation of \"crime of state\" that the royalists had just made. \"Far be it from my mind to pick up accusations in balloons, and much less to launch upon the Government, without proof, a slanderous accusation of pretending that the Government is directly mixed up in a criminal act of this nature,\" he says. But he alludes to the threat pronounced by the Socialist deputy Ángel Galarza (\"Do these words not imply an incitement, as cowardly as effective, to the commission of a very serious crime? Does this fact not imply any responsibility for the groups and parties that did not disavow these words?\"), to Casares Quiroga\\'s statement on the belligerence of the government over fascism (\"When from the head of the blue bench it is said that the Government is belligerent, who can prevent the agents of authority from reaching at some point to the very edges of crime?\") and to his alleged threat to Calvo Sotelo on June 16 (\"it is equivalent to pointing out, to announcing an \"a priori\" responsibility, without discerning whether or not he has incurred in it\"), so that in the political and moral order he does hold the Government responsible for what happened and, what is even more serious, accuses it of sponsoring violence:. Just as you are totally and absolutely overwhelmed, the Government and the leading elements, by the working masses, which you no longer control, so we are already totally overwhelmed by a sense of violence, which it has been you who have created and are spreading all over Spain. [...] You as a government, although you do not have direct or indirect criminal responsibility in the crime, you do have the enormous moral responsibility of sponsoring a policy of violence that arms the hand of the murderer; of having, from the blue bench, incited violence; of not having disavowed those who from the majority benches have pronounced words of threat and violence against the person of Mr. Calvo Sotelo. You will never take that away from you; you can, with censorship, make my words not reach the opinion... Ah! but rest assured that the blood of Mr. Calvo Sotelo is upon you, and you will never get rid of it... If you are, with greater or lesser skills, palliating the gravity of the facts, then the staggered responsibility will go to the top... and will reach the whole parliamentary system and will stain the regime itself with mud and misery and blood... Every day, on the part of the majority groups, on the part of the newspapers inspired by you, there is the excitement, the threat, the exhortation that the adversary must be crushed, that a policy of extermination must be carried out with him. You are practicing it daily: dead, wounded, outrages, coercion, fines, violence... This period of yours will be the maximum period of shame of a regime, of a system and of a Nation. We are seriously thinking that we cannot return to the Cortes to discuss an amendment, a private vote? No; the Parliament is already a hundred leagues away from the national opinion; there is an abyss between the farce that the Parliament represents and the deep and very serious national tragedy. We are not ready for this farce. You can continue; I know that you are going to pursue a policy of persecution, extermination and violence against everything that means right wing. You are profoundly deceiving yourselves: the greater the violence, the greater the reaction; for each one of the dead, another combatant will arise. Be assured —this has been a constant law in all human collectivities— that you, who are forging violence, will be the first victims of it... Now you are very calm because you see the adversary falling. The day will come when the same violence you have unleashed will fall upon you! [...] And soon you will be in Spain the Popular Front government of hunger and misery, as you are now the government of shame, mud and blood.. In another passage of his speech he had implicitly justified the uprising that was being prepared:. This clamor that comes to us from the countryside and cities indicates that what in generic terms you have come to call fascism is growing; but which is nothing more than the yearning, often noblest, to free oneself from a yoke and an oppression that in the name of the Popular Front the Government and the groups that support it are imposing on very large sectors of national opinion. It is a movement of healthy and even holy rebellion, which is taking hold in the hearts of the Spanish people and against which we are totally impotent, those of us who day after day and hour after hour have been sheltering behind democratic principles, legal norms and normal actions. [...] When the lives of the citizens are at the mercy of the first gunman, when the Government is incapable of putting an end to this state of affairs, do not pretend that the people believe neither in legality nor in democracy; be sure that they will drift more and more towards the paths of violence, and we men who are not capable of preaching violence nor taking advantage of it will be slowly displaced by others more audacious and more violent who will come to pick up this deep national feeling.. According to Ranzato, in the face of the formidable challenge that the right wing had just made, \"the response of the government and the parties that supported it was inadequate, dilatory and inconsistent. It would have been necessary the intervention of a head of government capable of refuting point by point, of expressing indignation for the assassination of one of the highest representatives of the opposition and of solemnly promising the rapid punishment of the perpetrators, but, at the same time, of denouncing the attempt of the right wing to take advantage of this crime to incite, in turn, to violence and rebellion\". But the president of the government, Casares Quiroga, had not attended the meeting of the Permanent Deputation (\"it was a very serious political error, and had the effect of seeming to give some reason to those who accused him of complicity in the assassination of the royalist leader\", says Ian Gibson), and on behalf of the government the Minister of State Augusto Barcia answered Gil-Robles, \"minimizing, evading and at times opposing him with a clumsy defense\", according to Ranzato. Answering with \"dignity and restraint\", according to Ian Gibson. \"A vacuous speech\", according to Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza. After reproaching Gil-Robles for having expressed himself in \"truly monstrous\" terms, Barcia resorted to the argument, used on innumerable occasions by the left, of holding the center-right governments of the previous biennium, one of whose most prominent figures had been the leader of the CEDA, ultimately responsible for the disorders. He then defended the actions of the Government in the clarification of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo, alleging that it had taken \"absolutely all the measures it could and had in its hands, and they have been taken, and immediately look for the Judge of maximum guarantee and of maximum hierarchy so that, entering in depth, without stopping at anything, going as far as it has to go, to clarify everything\". The Minister of the Interior, Juan Moles, also intervened briefly, who instead of \"clarifying at least all the aspects relating to the role played —before, during and after the events— by the police forces\", limited himself to saying that several members of the Assault Guard had been arrested and separated from service, without giving further details. He added the falsehood (\"a reflection that had neither head nor tail\", according to Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza) that the two agents guarding Calvo Sotelo\\'s home had put up resistance to those trying to enter the building and that they had \"demanded certain guarantees\" to allow them to pass. According to Ranzato, the government lost its last chance to \"free itself from the ballast of the extreme left that was dragging them to the bottom... by means of a clear separation of responsibilities\".. According to Ranzato, neither did the moderate socialist Indalecio Prieto take the opportunity to dissociate himself from the extreme left, perhaps embarrassed by the fact that those who had committed the assassination of Calvo Sotelo were not exalted largocaballerists, but men of his bodyguard. According to Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, Prieto \"lost a wonderful opportunity to keep quiet\" because his speech was an extreme example of \"cynicism\", since, according to this historian, from the very day of the assassination Prieto already knew who had assassinated Calvo Sotelo and was covering up for them. Addressing Gil-Robles, Prieto again resorted to the argument of the left that the violence of that moment was the consequence of \"the enormous ferocities committed on the occasion of the repression of the events of October 1934\": \"You did not calculate then that you had sown a plant whose poison would also reach you. None of us has approved of the events that are now taking place, we condemn and deplore them... but... your honor has no right to believe your hands are totally clean and clean of responsibility while you strive to muddy those of others\". Prieto argued as follows:. Mr. Calvo Sotelo\\'s life was sacred, unquestionably, but no more, for us, than that of any other citizen who has fallen in identical conditions, and when Your Honor imputed the Government and the parliamentary forces that assist it to be the cause, in one order or another, with direct or indirect responsibility, according to Your Honor, of that event, it happened that in your imagination there was only one line of victims... We cover them all, absolutely all and equally... Sirval\\'s case is exactly the same as that of Calvo Sotelo... The excesses of the public forces, the crimes of individuals belonging to the public forces, the lack of respect for human life in Spain did not start on February 16... In Spain the present ominous period began at the time of your mandate, I do not know if it was under your inspiration, but, at least, under your silence and your cover-up.. The truth is that Prieto, who in recent months had been one of the few leaders of the left who had denounced the violence of his co-religionists, had changed his discourse since the beginning of July (perhaps because \"he saw the war inexorably coming,\" according to Ranzato). On July 2 the Executive Committee of the PSOE, which Prieto controlled, had declared that \"if we are invited to violent combats, violence will be our system. Tomorrow when the situation arises, our voice will be raised to ask the proletariat to go to war.\" On July 9 Prieto had published in his newspaper El Liberal in Bilbao an article in which he appealed to \"co-religionists and friends\" to \"live cautiously\" and \"be alert\" \"in case the moment comes\" to use \"our force\". He also addressed the Government: \"One good forewit is worth two afterwits and a forearmed Government is worth forty\" (Spanish: Hombre prevenido vale por dos y el Gobierno prevenido vale por cuarenta). Three days later, on July 12, the eve of Calvo Sotelo\\'s assassination, he had reiterated, again in El Liberal: \"Be sure that in launching themselves [\\'those who from the adversary camp prepare the attack\\'] they are risking everything, absolutely everything. Just as we must get used to the idea that after our defeat we will be given no quarter. The contest, then, if it finally arises, will have to take place in conditions of extreme harshness\".Gil/Robles\\' reply to Prieto was forceful: \"Mr. Prieto said that the responsibilities of each one had to be measured. I want everything to be discussed here, so that the responsibilities of your honor and of all those who prepared the revolutionary movement and unleashed the catastrophe on the Republic, on Asturias, so that the tremendous cruelties that took place in the revolution are made clear...\".José Díaz, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, after recalling once again the \"repression of Asturias\", in which \"with the consent of the Government, Moorish troops were taken to that region to put Spanish miners through the edge of their gumias\", issues a warning to Gil-Robles regarding his alleged involvement in the plot to end the Republic: \"Be careful! We are all vigilant so that you cannot carry out your attempts...\". On the other hand, he accuses the Government of lukewarmness by \"falling short, by not getting to the bottom of the elements responsible for the civil war in Spain\", among which he points directly to the CEDA. He ended by addressing the right wing deputies: \"Here we are, the workers\\' forces in the first place, to support the Government, and then to prevent your attempts to lead Spain to catastrophe from succeeding\".The following speaker was the centrist Manuel Portela Valladares who, according to Luis Romero, \"is perhaps the only speaker who remains neutral\". He stated that he would not support the extension of the state of alarm because, having declared himself a belligerent, the Government would not be able to apply it \"with serenity, with moderation, without passion, with equality\". For his part, the Lliga deputy Joan Ventosa launched an \"unmerciful, although realistic\" attack against the President of the Government Casares Quiroga whom he considered the least suitable person \"to reestablish civil coexistence among the Spanish and to put an end to the existing civil war\". Like the monarchists and Gil-Robles, he also recalls \"the [parliamentary] tumults produced by elements that form part of the government minority, from which insults, slander, attacks and incitements to personal attacks have constantly come from\". And he underlines that the attack against Calvo Sotelo has no comparison with others because it is \"the representative of a force of opinion in conflict with the one in the Government, who is assassinated by those who appear as agents of this Government\". Ventonsa ended by saying that he would not support the extension of the state of alarm. José María Cid, of the Spanish Agrarian Party, then intervened, recalling the threat made in Parliament against Calvo Sotelo by the Socialist deputy Ángel Galarza (a threat which had also been alluded to, without naming the deputy, in the declaration of the monarchists). Finally the vote was taken on the extension of the state of alarm, which was approved by thirteen votes against five and one abstention (that of Portela Valladares). As soon as the session was adjourned Gil-Robles, as other prominent members of the right wing had already done or were about to do, left Madrid. He returned by car to Biarritz from where he had come as soon as he learned of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo.That same day in the afternoon, the socialist caballerist newspaper Claridad responded to Gil-Robles\\' affirmation, in threatening and ironic tones, that the state of alarm had not served to put an end to violence: \"If the state of alarm cannot subdue the right wing, let a dictatorship of the Popular Front come as soon as possible. This is the logical and historical consequence of Mr. Gil-Robles\\' speech. Dictatorship for dictatorship, the left wing dictatorship. You don\\'t want this government? Then replace it with a dictatorial government of the left. You don\\'t want a state of alarm? Then grant the Cortes full powers. You don\\'t want civil peace? Then let there be a full-scale civil war. You don\\'t want Parliament? Then govern without Parliament. Anything but a return of the right wing. October was their last card and they will not play any more\". The article conveyed the confidence of the Socialists of all tendencies, and the working class left in general, that the \"proletariat\" would be capable of winning in a foreseeable civil war which they estimated to be short-lived. Consequences. Impact on the military. The assassination of Calvo Sotelo provoked the last indecisive or indifferent military men to join the rebellion, giving it the definitive impetus. Among the military already committed to the conspiracy, the assassination and its circumstances so excited the spirits that General Mola had to travel on the 14th from Pamplona to Logroño to prevent the clandestine Spanish Military Union (UME) from revolting, together with Phalanx, on the 16th. In addition, several military men even prepared a plot to kidnap the President of the Republic Manuel Azaña, which was finally discarded due to the imminence of the uprising.Eduardo González Calleja has pointed out that \"the assassination did not provoke the military uprising, but it increased the determination of the conspirators and encouraged those who still hesitated to participate in the uprising that was being prepared to take the step\". This analysis is shared by other historians, such as José Luis Rodríguez Jiménez who affirms that \"the attack was in no way decisive for the preparations for the coup that was about to break out, but it deepened the existing rift in political life, wrapped in a tension already very difficult to dissimulate. Joan Maria Thomàs, for his part, affirms that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was \"decisive in arousing greater support among the generals and officers for the coup and, above all, in arousing support for it among sectors of the population\". It also induced the passivity of democratically oriented military personnel when it came to defending the Republic. Luis Romero states: \"On July 13, the conspiracy is well advanced, on the verge of exploding the rebel movement, but the shock produced by the death of Calvo Sotelo has a definite influence in the final setting of the date, in deciding the hesitant and subsequent events\". Ian Gibson considers that the assassination \"gave the rebels —whose conspiratorial plans were already well advanced on July 13— a new and unbeatable justification for the Movement in the eyes of world opinion. It convinced the still hesitant military that the time had come to take sharp decisions.\" Republican military officer Jesús Pérez Salas wrote in his memoirs about the impact of Calvo Sotelo\\'s assassination on the Army as follows:. I do not know from whom the idea of committing such an outrage [the assassination of Calvo Sotelo] could have come from; but I will say that not even those chosen by the rebels could have done it better than those who committed it. [...] If by applying the law of retaliation, Lieutenant Castillo\\'s friends, comrades or co-religionists had shot Calvo Sotelo in the street or wherever they had found him, it would only have been one more act of terrorism, in addition to the many that had been carried out that summer. The impression that this act would have made on the Army would have been deplorable, of course, and as a consequence, it would have constituted one more step towards its intervention in the uprising... But in no way could it have been the straw that broke the camel\\'s back... But when its details were revealed and it became known that the forces of Public Order had intervened in it, the reaction was tremendous. The leaders knew how to quickly take advantage of the mood of the officers to put their plans into practice. [...] It is useless to try to play down the importance of the event. If the forces of Public Order, on which the rights and security of the citizens rest, are capable of executing acts of this nature, they evidently prove their absolute lack of discipline and forgetfulness of their sacred mission. It is clear that only a few guards and two officers were involved in such a reprehensible act; but that they dared to take such a step is a symptom of the decomposition of these forces, or of part of them, which were known to be infected by the virus of politics [...].. Perhaps the subsequent action of the Army could have been avoided by a rapid and energetic intervention of the Republican Government, punishing the executors [of the crime] and, above all, expelling the contaminated nucleus from the Security Corps, in order to give the country the impression that the Government was ready to put an end to terrorism from whatever quarter it came.. The American historian Stanley G. Payne attaches even more importance to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo because he considers that this assassination, which according to him meant \"the end of the constitutional system\" of the republic, was what led the military to revolt. The assassination of Calvo Sotelo was the catalyst necessary to transform a loose conspiracy into a violent rebellion that could trigger a massive struggle,\" affirms Payne. Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza supports the same thesis, since he considers that the military conspiracy \"had begun its steps several months before... but in hesitant steps, taken in good measure by people who only wanted a pretext for not rising up. However, after learning of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo and its circumstances, \"many military men then decided to join the uprising, to the point that it is quite possible that without the assassination of Calvo Sotelo the uprising, which in any case would have broken out in a few days, would have turned into a new Sanjurjada\".. Both Payne and Bullón de Mendoza provide as evidence General Franco\\'s change of attitude (\"the limit situation of which he had always spoken as the only factor that could justify an armed rebellion had finally come about.... The moment had come when the cautious general had decided that it was even more dangerous not to rebel than to rebel,\" Payne states). Both recall that only a day before the assassination he had again expressed his doubts about participating in the uprising. Bullón de Mendoza states that \"Franco, whose prestige in the Army is difficult to exaggerate, was certainly not an enthusiastic conspirator, and moreover he thought that Mola\\'s preparations were rather shoddy, which is why, like many other military men, he had serious doubts about the chances of success of the coup that was being prepared.\" For that reason on July 12 Franco sent a message to Mola, through Colonel Valentín Galarza, in which he told him \"not very extensive geography\", \"which meant nothing other than the need to postpone the coup until it was properly prepared\", according to Bullón de Mendoza. General Franco\\'s message caused enormous consternation in General Mola, who had to change some instructions and even considered sending General Sanjurjo to Morocco, so that he would be the one to lead the rebellion in the Protectorate. But after learning of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo and its circumstances, General Franco\\'s position took a radical turn. On July 14, the day after the assassination, he informed Mola of his participation in the uprising. According to his cousin and aide Francisco Franco Salgado-Araujo, Franco stated \"with great indignation\" \"that it was no longer possible to wait any longer and that he completely lost hope that the government would change its behavior in carrying out this crime of State, treacherously assassinating a deputy of the nation using the force of public order at its service\". Luis Romero comments: \"If the attack [against Calvo Sotelo] had not taken place, we do not know how Franco would have reacted if Mola decided to revolt and Sanjurjo moved to Morocco; he would probably have joined the movement. The fact that the Dragon Rapide was in flight does not mean that Franco had made up his mind\".Hugh Thomas had already argued a position similar to Payne\\'s and Bullón de Mendoza\\'s in his history of the civil war published in 1961 and revised in 1976: \"Although the conspiracy had been brewing for so long, it was the death of Calvo Sotelo that really decided the conspirators to set it in motion; otherwise they might not have had the courage to take the first step. Now, on the other hand, if they had not acted, they might have been overwhelmed by his followers\".On the other hand, the shock caused by the news of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo also inclined the Carlists to definitely join the uprising led by General Mola, with whom they had been negotiating for several weeks without reaching an agreement. On the night of Wednesday the 15th, the Supreme Carlist Military Assembly of Saint Jean de Luz officially authorized the participation of Carlism in the military movement: \"the Traditionalist Communion joins, with all its forces, in all of Spain to the Military Movement for the Salvation of the Homeland\". Beginning of the uprising. Finally, all obeyed Mola\\'s order that the rebellion should begin on Friday, July 17 in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco (once the news was known that the forces in Africa would be ready as of July 16) and in a staggered manner between Saturday, July 18 and Monday, July 20 in the peninsula —unlike the proclamation in which all the garrisons rose up at a specific day and time, Mola gave freedom to each square to rise up when it considered it appropriate with the intention of provoking a domino effect; the only date and time he fixed was that of the uprising in the protectorate: the 17th at 17:00—. This was communicated on the 15th by General Mola to his liaison in Madrid, Lieutenant Colonel Valentín Galarza, \"The Technician\". The day before, the Dragon Rapide plane that was to transfer General Franco from the Canary Islands to the Protectorate of Morocco had landed at the Gando aerodrome (Gran Canaria) (it had not landed in Tenerife, where Franco was, because it did not have a suitable airport; Franco had to look for a pretext to travel there and he found it in the need to attend the funeral of General Amado Balmes who had just died due to an accident while handling a gun). At a quarter past seven in the morning of Friday, July 17, a liaison of General Mola sent from Bayonne three coded radiotelegrams to General Franco in Tenerife, to General Sanjurjo in Lisbon and to Lieutenant Colonel Juan Seguí Almuzara in Melilla in which they were reminded of the order to begin the uprising on the 17th at 17:00. However, according to Luis Romero the date that appeared on the radiograms was Saturday, July 18, and the uprising was brought forward in the Protectorate of Morocco to Friday afternoon, July 17, because the conspirators in Melilla were forced to do so to avoid being arrested when they were gathered in the offices of the Boundary Commission located in the Alcazaba.Some conservative leaders who had not participated in the conspiracy were warned of the date of the coup and were advised to leave Madrid (or Barcelona, as in the case of Francesc Cambó). Alejandro Lerroux, for example, went to Portugal and from there gave his support to the coup. The one who decided to stay was Melquiades Álvarez who would die murdered in the sacking of the Model Prison of Madrid on August 22, 1936. The right wing leaders who were committed to the uprising had begun to leave the capital after attending the funeral of Calvo Sotelo on the afternoon of Tuesday, July 14, or after the meeting of the Permanent Deputation which was held on the morning of the following day. José María Gil-Robles left by car to Biarritz that same afternoon of the 15th; Antonio Goicoechea left on Friday 17th to a farm in the province of Salamanca near the border with Portugal. Also leaving Madrid that same Friday 17th were Calvo Sotelo\\'s wife and children. Early in the evening they took the Lisbon express. Threatening graffiti had appeared in the capital, such as one that read \"the descendants of Calvo Sotelo, will follow the same path as their father\". They arrived in Lisbon on the morning of Saturday the 18th and at the Estación del Rocío, \"crowded with people\" —as Calvo Sotelo\\'s daughter Enriqueta recalled— General Sanjurjo was waiting for them, who offered his arm to the widow to leave the station. It seems that the general told her: \"We have lost the most illustrious man in Spain\". Calvo Sotelo\\'s family would leave Lisbon to settle in the rebel zone in September 1937. Assessment. The Italian historian Gabriele Ranzato has pointed out that what the assassination of Calvo Sotelo revealed was that \"the State of the Popular Front, instead of limiting itself to pursuing and striking down with the law the instigators, promoters and executors of subversive violence, using all its legal repressive resources, had, on the other hand, allowed summary justice —or rather summary vengeance—, and moreover against one of the most eminent figures of the opposition, by members of its forces of order, without, on the other hand, taking immediate and severe measures against them. This had led to an obfuscation of the rule of law, capable of engendering great insecurity in many disconcerted citizens...\".Joan Maria Thomàs agrees with Ranzato when he states that \"the most important thing was the government\\'s lack of reaction to the assassination of the ultra-right winger and congressman, which did not act energetically to reestablish order and disappointed those sectors that were clamoring for a change of direction.A similar assessment is made by Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, but he goes further by arguing that the Government could have avoided the civil war with a forceful action. \"Although there are many sources of the time that point to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo as the point of no return towards civil war, we believe that the conflict could still have been avoided. Everything depended on the attitude taken by the Government, because if it reacted with unprecedented forcefulness to the unprecedented fact that a National Deputy was assassinated with the collaboration of the State Security Forces, it is quite possible that it would have managed to convince a large sector of Spanish society (conspirators included) that order was finally going to be reestablished. Bullón de Mendoza also states that \"had it not been for the impact of his death, it is quite possible that [the National Uprising] would not have been, as the Government supposed, a new \\'sanjurjada\\'\".In 1965 the American historian Gabriel Jackson already pointed out that \"for anyone who was not a blind supporter of the left it was intolerable that a leader of the opposition should be assassinated by uniformed officers driving a Government vehicle\", although he added that \"it was equally intolerable that the Phalanx and the UME should conduct with impunity a campaign of terror against leftist officers\". In this way he equated the murders of Lieutenant del Castillo and Calvo Sotelo which he said both \"horrified public opinion much more than any of the numerous disorders and occasional deaths since February\".Stanley G. Payne has highlighted the fact that \"never before in the history of Western parliamentary regimes had a detachment of the State Police joined with revolutionary criminals to kidnap and assassinate an opposition leader. But the comparison no longer fit in reality, because the Second Republic was no longer a constitutional parliamentary system\".For his part Julius Ruiz has pointed out the similarities that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo presents with the \"Red Terror\" that was unleashed in the Republican zone during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, in which he coincides to a large extent with what Payne has pointed out. \"His assassination was a precedent for the later terror in several fundamental respects. First, it was carried out by a brigade with a mixture of police and militia.... Condés invoked his authority to convince the politician to accompany the assassins in the dead of night. This modus operandi would be used on countless occasions during the following four months. Secondly, Calvo Sotelo was a victim of gangsterism: he was taken for a \"ride\" in the back seat of a police van and his body was disposed of in the city cemetery. Thirdly, the Socialist leaders provided political protection to the perpetrators of the assassination.\" Legacy during Franco\\'s regime: the mythification of the \"protomartyr\". The rebel side used the assassination of Calvo Sotelo to justify and legitimize the coup d\\'état of July 1936 and directly accused the government of the Republic of crime. This is what General Franco said on April 19, 1938: \"That Regime died definitively that sad dawn in which a seductive Government, acting as the executing arm of Freemasonry, plotted and carried out, through its agents, the vile assassination of the Chief of the parliamentary opposition and great patrician: José Calvo Sotelo\". That same year of 1938, the publishing house Ediciones Antisectarias of Burgos had published a pamphlet entitled Por quién fue asesinado Calvo Sotelo (By whom Calvo Sotelo was assassinated), whose author was the journalist of the Catholic newspaper El Debate Benjamín Bentura and whose purpose was to demonstrate the implication of the government of the Popular Front in the assassination. One of the \"proofs\" provided by Bentura was the alleged meeting that Captain Condés held at one o\\'clock in the morning of Monday the 13th —two hours before leading the expedition that would end Calvo Sotelo\\'s life— with the President of the Government Casares Quiroga. Condés would have been accompanied by the Assault Lieutenant of the Cavalry Group Máximo Moreno. He relied exclusively on information provided by a commander of the Civil Guard, a friend of his. Ian Gibson underplays the credibility of this story —there is no record of the alleged interview with Casares Quiroga— and yet \"the visit of Condés and Moreno to Casares Quiroga became a dogma of Francoist propaganda. Dogma, like any other, unquestionable\". As was also considering the assassination of Calvo Sotelo as \"a State crime\". This was the official doctrine during the forty years of Franco\\'s dictatorship.In the final months of the civil war, Generalissimo Franco ordered the formation of a Commission on the Illegitimacy of the Powers Acting on July 18, 1936, with the mission of having its members find proof that the Popular Front government against which part of the Army had risen was \"illegitimate\" in order to give legitimacy to the coup d\\'état of July 1936. One of the \"proofs\" adduced by the Commission was that the Government of the Republic was behind the assassins of Calvo Sotelo. To prove it, they provided testimonies whose veracity historians doubt today. As Ian Gibson has pointed out, the members of the Commission \"made a special effort to locate people who supported the thesis, or dogma, that the assassination had been \"a scandalous State crime\". So much so that, in many cases, the statements of these witnesses cannot be considered reliable\". The information gathered by the Commission was incorporated in the immediate postwar period into the General Cause. One of the testimonies used by the Commission was that of Andrés Amado, friend and co-religionist of Calvo Sotelo, who wrote a detailed account, \"loaded with value judgments\" (according to Ian Gibson), of his dealings during the early hours of Monday the 13th. Such was their interest that they asked former Socialist minister during the war Julián Zugazagoitia, who had been arrested in France by the Nazis and handed over to Franco, about the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. Zugazagoitia in his statement of Luis Cuenca said: \"I had formed a very bad concept of this individual, as an element of the Party capable of committing assassinations\".The judges of the General Cause also made an enormous effort to obtain testimonies proving the involvement of the Republican government. They obtained only a few, of whose veracity again there are doubts, even more so in this case given the context in which the statements were made since years of imprisonment and even the death penalty were at stake. Luis Romero in his book Por qué y cómo mataron a Calvo Sotelo (Why and how Calvo Sotelo was killed, 1982) wrote: \"The statements included in the General Cause must be cautiously valued, in view of the extreme circumstances in which they were made; they contain valuable data. For his part, Ian Gibson, author of La noche en que mataron a Calvo Sotelo (The Night Calvo Sotelo was Killed, 1982), stated that the witnesses were conditioned \"probably by the desire to tell the judges what they wanted to hear\".. At the end of the war, four of the ten or twelve Assault Guards who were in van No. 17 were detained and interrogated by Francoist judges: the driver Orencio Bayo Cambronero; José del Rey Hernández, who sat in front with Condés; and Aniceto Castro Piñeiro and Bienvenido Pérez Rojo, who rode in the back. However, according to Ian Gibson, the testimony that the Francoist judges took most advantage of —and that \"profoundly influenced Francoist historiography about the assassination of Calvo Sotelo\" was not that of any of them, but that of the lieutenant of the 9th Security Company Esteban Abellán Llopis, whose veracity Gibson has many doubts about because he was focused on implicating the director general of Security José Alonso Mallol and the Minister of the Interior Juan Moles, which was what the Francoist judges were looking for. Abellán said that the officers of the Assault Guard who went to the Surgical Team where the corpse of Lieutenant Castillo was found \"spoke of taking revenge\" and that Alonso Mallol, who was also present, did not contradict them, but \"remained next to the group of those who were most vociferous, and although he did not speak, it could be seen that he paid attention to what the others were saying\". More importance was given to his testimony about the alleged complicity in the assassination of the Minister of the Interior Juan Moles, who had authorized the search of the homes of prominent right wing leaders, although Abellán was not present at the meeting held with him by four officers of the Pontejos Barracks, nor was he at the Ministry of the Interior. What he affirmed was what he had heard some officers say in the General Directorate of Security: \"Captain Serna joined Captains Cuevas and Puig [both from the Pontejos Barracks] and they said that a fat person had to be killed, so that it would be a big deal. Immediately after finishing this conversation, Captains Serna and Cuevas left and, when about half an hour had passed, they returned saying that they had been talking personally with the Minister of the Interior, Juan Moles, to whom they had asked permission to take reprisals for the death of Castillo and that the Minister had authorized them to carry out searches in the homes of significant right wing persons\". Gibson adds that Abellán\\'s statement contradicts the testimony he collected in his book by Lieutenant Alfredo León Lupión, which he considers much more credible because he was present at the meetings reported by Abellán.At the same time that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was used to justify and legitimize the coup d\\'état of July 1936 and Franco\\'s dictatorship, the mythification of his figure began in the middle of the civil war. The monarchist José Félix de Lequerica wrote on July 11, 1937, in El Ideal Gallego an article entitled \"The last afternoon with Calvo Sotelo\" in which he narrated the meeting he had with him and other monarchist deputies in a picnic area on the outskirts of Madrid to have tea just a year before, on Saturday afternoon, July 11, 1936 —a day and a half later he would be assassinated—. In the article he said the following:. We were all overcome by the fever of the approaching event and the joy of being gathered around the man who enveloped Spanish hope as in a halo materialized in light and fog. People looked at him with expectation. The dancing couples were absent for a while from their chatter to turn their eyes to the key politician of all illusions. The conversation was fast, funny and naturally a little malicious. Calvo laughed a lot and celebrated with great childishness the witticisms of each one. In the midst of the pain we were happy and sure of victory.. Twenty-three years later, July 17, 1960, Luis de Galinsoga, director of the monarchist newspaper ABC when he was assassinated, published an article in the same newspaper entitled \"Conciencia de mártir en Calvo Sotelo\" (Martyr\\'s conscience in Calvo Sotelo). Among other things it said:. RETREATED in a Celtiberian unconsciousness, people were happily sipping their horchata or their beer on the terraces of Madrid\\'s cafés. [...] Meanwhile, a man, a whole man, carried on his broad shoulders the collective anguish and concern. It is said that he conjured upon himself, while his apocalyptic arms were beating the trembling air in the hemicycle of the Congress of Deputies, the lightning that was about to explode. That man\\'s name was José Calvo Sotelo.. His friends were not unaware that he was fully aware of the danger that surrounded him. One of us, Joaquín Bau, heard it this way from the tribune when crossing one afternoon, in the middle of the daze, and the unconsciousness of the matter, the Gran Vía in Madrid: \"These people will not react until they kill me\". It was the prophecy of his own holocaust. [...] The sacrifice of Calvo Sotelo was determined by God, as the true fulminating genesis of the glorious and fruitful National Uprising. [...] Calvo Sotelo renewed every morning, and I was a witness of it every night, his conscience of martyr, his firm resolution to be a martyr, his unshakable purpose to reach the last consequence of his combativity against the Republic... Every day, every evening, his words became more trembling and more fiery in that seat of the Congress on which converged in an impudent flood the rude imprecations, the insults, the cynical threats of a majority recruited among outlaws and gunmen. All to no avail. Every afternoon Calvo Sotelo raised his broad shoulders as a giant of History, trembling with anxiety to save Spain from so much shame and so much crime. Yes; that man knew very well what he was doing. That man knew that they were going to kill him. What he perhaps did not know was that by risking his life he was carrying out his best work... A profound lesson of historical consequences, because it is not a bad thing for the people to always have a handhold of hope to hold on to in desperate times, like an anchor that saves them from shipwreck. In that tragic hour of Spain, that anchor was called José Calvo Sotelo. And the anchor of salvation was his death, at the same time glorious and infamous. Because on one side, that of the victim, his sacrifice was sublime and odd, but on the side of the victimizers, the State crime perpetrated on Calvo Sotelo in the livid light of dawn, in Velázquez Street, inaugurated, as Caudillo Franco has recalled several times, a whole system and a whole school of common crime, of executions from the Power applied to politics. Calvo Sotelo knew that his life was the initial price of the reaction of Spain in defense of itself and, by key, of the whole West.... Four days earlier, on July 13, 1960 (the twenty-fourth anniversary of the assassination), General Franco inaugurated the Monument to Calvo Sotelo  in the Plaza de Castilla in Madrid. In his speech he said:. The death of Calvo Sotelo by the very agents in charge of security was the palpable demonstration that, with the brakes broken, the Nation was hurtling vertiginously towards communism. There was no longer any room for doubt or hesitation: the assassination, orchestrated from the Power, of the most prominent leader of the opposition, united all Spaniards in a unanimous and fervent yearning to save Spain. Without the sacrifice of Calvo Sotelo, the fate of the National Movement could have been very different. His treacherous death overcame the natural scruples of the patriots, marking them the path of an unavoidable duty. .   Alía Miranda, Francisco (2011). Julio de 1936.

      "{'input': ' Chronology. The Bronze Age is defined by the widespread adoption of bronze, an alloy of tin and copper which is found in Britain and Ireland from c. 2200–2100 BCE. The Bronze Age ends around the early to mid first millennium BCE, at which point ironworking is introduced, followed by a substantial decrease and eventual collapse in the production, circulation, and use of bronze tools and weapons and the beginning of the Iron Age. Bronze Age Britain and Ireland is usually dated to c. 2150–800 BCE, subdivided into Early Bronze Age (EBA, c. 2150–1600 BCE), Middle Bronze Age (MBA, c. 1600–1150 BCE) and Late Bronze Age (LBA, c. 1150-800/600 BCE). Recent reviews have tended to include the Chalcolithic (\\'copper-using\\', or \\'Beaker\\') phase with the Early Bronze Age.In 1986, Patricia Christie outlined a chronology of the Cornish Bronze Age based on Colin Burgess\\'s thirteen industrial stages, but with different regional type-find names. Christie divided the Bronze Age into an \\'earlier\\' and a \\'later\\' stage with c. 1300 BCE as the point of division.. In 2011, Andy Jones outlined an alternative chronology based on modern radiocarbon dating, starting with the Cornish Bell Beaker-using period. Jones explains that Christie\\'s 1986 chronology predates the development of high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry. Radiocarbon dating of metal associated contexts now gives a slightly different set of dates: Overview. Summary. The changes that occurred around the start of the Bronze Age in Cornwall were probably the result of a combination of factors. Cornwall\\'s geographical location  connected it to communities on the Atlantic Façade in Ireland, Wales, and Brittany, while at the same time linking it with Devon and Wessex in southern Britain. Genetic studies and bone isotope analysis demonstrate long-distance movement both within Britain and from the European mainland at this time, perhaps initially motivated by the search for metals. Travel to and from Cornwall may have led to the spread of a range of ideas and beliefs, as communities in Cornwall interacted with people from distant places, bringing new monument styles and ideologies that would have been interpreted within a framework of previously existing knowledge and practices. Bell Beaker period (c. 2400–1700 BCE). The Bell Beaker complex expanded to Britain and Ireland by c. 2450 BCE, bringing new ceramic forms (\\'Beakers\\') and burial practices, around the same time as the earliest known metal artefacts in Britain. The spread of the Beaker culture to Britain is associated with the migration of people from mainland Europe, possibly from somewhere in the vicinity of the Lower Rhine. These people carried substantial levels of Yamnaya-related ancestry in their DNA, and are believed to have replaced a minimum of 90% of the British Neolithic gene pool within a few hundred years.Bell Beaker culture was probably introduced to Cornwall from further east in Britain, rather than directly from the European mainland. Evidence for Bell Beaker activity is relatively scarce in Cornwall compared to other parts of Britain, and most of the Beaker pottery found here is relatively late, usually in coastal areas, and mainly found in the west. The introduction of Beakers into Cornwall is roughly contemporaneous with increased monument construction and changes in ritual and burial customs, but there is no evidence that Beakers were associated with these. Beaker-period burials in Cornwall are typically cremations, rather than the single-inhumation graves that are associated with Beaker burials in the rest of Britain.. Andy Jones argues that the small number of Beaker artefacts found in Cornwall in this period implies that an invasion or large scale migration is unlikely. Early Bronze Age (c. 2050–1500 BCE). Settlements were probably restricted to uplands and coastal areas during the Early Bronze Age, and direct evidence for domestic structures is very rare. The main focus seems to have been monument construction, which was at its peak during this period, and thousands of barrows and cairns, numerous stone circles and stone rows, and the entrance graves (in Scilly and West Penwith) were mainly built between c. 2000 and 1500 BCE.Gold and tin extraction very likely began before the beginning of the second millennium BCE in Cornwall, and analysis of artefactual material suggests that Cornish metals were likely to have been exported to the rest of Britain and Ireland, the European mainland, and as far as the Eastern Mediterranean. Cultural and economic links between Cornwall and other communities on the Atlantic façade in the Early Bronze Age is demonstrated by similar burial practices, such as the entrance graves of West Penwith and Scilly, and metalwork finds such as the four Cornish gold lunulae, a high-status artefact which originated in Ireland.New pottery styles originated c. 2000 BCE, such as Food Vessels, Collared Urns, and especially Trevisker Ware, a distinctive regional pottery style that originated in Cornwall and continued to be produced for almost a millennium. Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500–1100 BCE). The Middle Bronze Age was a period of major social and economic change. From c. 1500, an agricultural revolution occurred, farming expanded, and formal land boundaries were constructed. The landscape became \\'domesticated\\', marking a fundamental difference between this period and the previous stage. The Middle Bronze Age was dominated by settlements rather than monuments; older ceremonial sites were abandoned, large mounds were no longer built, and ritual and burial activity shifted to sites within or near to settlements. There was a pronounced increase in settlement activity, and regionally distinctive sunken-floored roundhouses were constructed in the lowlands, while large numbers of stone huts were built in the uplands, particularly on Bodmin Moor, resulting in a relatively high settlement density by this time.Trevisker Ware pottery is the only ceramic type found in Cornwall during the Middle Bronze Age, and the style spread to Devon, Dorset, and South Wales, and is even sometimes found as far away as Kent, Ireland, and France.Widespread climatic deterioration is supposed to have taken place over the Middle Bronze Age period, perhaps contributing to an extensive abandonment of upland areas in south-west Britain.Population migrations from Europe are thought to have introduced comparatively high levels of Early European Farmer ancestry into southern Britain over a 500-year period from c. 1300 to 800 BCE. Late Bronze Age (c. 1100–800 BCE). By the turn of the first millennium BCE, sunken-floored roundhouses were no longer being built, and were replaced by post-ring roundhouses similar to those found across southern Britain, which probably spread into Cornwall from Devon. Around the same time, Trevisker Ware ceramics were replaced by versions of the Late Bronze Age (\\'Post-Deverel-Rimbury\\') Plain Ware found throughout southern Britain at this time. The focus of activity shifted from upland to lowland zones, perhaps caused by a combination of environmental and socio-economic factors. Upland settlements on Bodmin Moor may have been abandoned after c. 1000 BCE, perhaps with continuing seasonal use connected with the movement of livestock herds to upland pastures in summer months.Late Bronze Age metalwork provides evidence for increasing contact with the rest of Britain, as well as continuing links with communities along the Atlantic Façade. Large hoards of gold and bronze artefacts date from this period. Settlements. The remains of Bronze Age settlements are found in upland, lowland, and coastal habitats, and are widely distributed across Cornwall; in West Penwith, on the north Cornish coast, on the Lizard peninsula, on Bodmin Moor, and on the Isles of Scilly. Settlements next to rivers are only rarely found, but it is likely that these have usually been later buried by sand and alluvium, making them more difficult to discover.Settlement locations appear to have been chosen for reasons which included nearby resource availability and ensuring that important landmarks were visible from the settlement. Lowland settlements such as Trethellan and Trevisker were positioned to exploit coastal and woodland resources, as well as provide access to pastures in the nearby uplands. In upland areas such as Bodmin Moor and the West Penwith Moors, settlements were often located near cairns or prominent rocks. Most settlements in Scilly were built by the coast, with locations selected to provide shelter from prevailing winds, but with the most sheltered locations further inland being avoided, balancing protection from weather conditions with the ability to easily obtain food. A 2014 study using visibility analysis concluded that the Leskernick Hill settlement was \"most likely the result of two separate decision-making processes, one to optimize the visibility of ritual monuments and important natural landmarks, and the other to optimize the visibility of nearby tin-extraction areas.\"Settlement sizes vary considerably. Evidence from the Cornish lowlands suggests that settlements here were much smaller than in the uplands, typically comprising only one to three domestic structures. Trethellan, a small village of at least seven roundhouses, is the largest lowland settlement so far excavated. On the Bodmin Moor uplands, although some isolated huts are found, the overwhelming majority occur in settlements of very variable size, from 5 or 6 huts in small settlements such as Catshole Tor, to very large settlements such as Roughtor North, where there are over a hundred huts. The dense concentration of roundhouses at some upland sites may indicate that large communities inhabited the uplands, or alternatively that the same locality was being occupied by several generations of people over long periods of time.Settlement activity during the Early Bronze Age seems to have been restricted to coastal areas and uplands. Direct evidence for settlement from this period is very rare, and consists of relatively insubstantial isolated buildings, such as the structures found at Sennen (c. 2400–2100 BCE), Gwithian (the so-called \\'Beaker house\\', c. 1890–1610 BCE), and Tremough, Penryn (c. 1900–1600 BCE).In the Middle Bronze Age the relatively temporary Early Bronze Age structures are superseded by more permanent roundhouse settlements, as with other parts of South-West Britain at this time. By c. 1500 BCE, the archaeological record indicates fairly dense settlement activity in both the upland and lowland zones. The period c. 1600–1200 BCE is thought to have been a period of milder climate, allowing upland areas to be more easily exploited compared with the preceding centuries. The pronounced increase in the number of inland and lowland settlements at this time may be connected with increasing alluvial tin exploitation. In general, most lowland settlements of this period were inhabited by families who lived as agriculturalists, raising livestock and growing crops, practising small-scale metalsmithing, and trading pottery and stone.Evidence for Late Bronze Age settlement in Cornwall is much less common compared with the Middle Bronze Age. In the upland zones c. 1000 BCE, field patterns were modified, commons expanded, and permanent settlement appears to have ended. The standard explanation is that upland settlements were abandoned at this time, perhaps as a collective decision, due to climatic changes and soil degradation which may have been exacerbated by intensive agricultural practices and increased population density. Others have argued that this interpretation is not supported by environmental evidence, and that the development of more complex ownership patterns in the upland zone may be responsible for the observed changes in lifestyle. Rather than being completely abandoned, upland settlements may have been seasonally occupied, perhaps by cooperative groups whose primary homes were in the lowlands. The smaller artefact collection finds in the uplands also suggests that upland buildings were only used temporarily at specific times of the year, or were regularly abandoned for short periods.There may have been links between upland and lowland settlements, with the lowlands permanently occupied, and upland settlements only being occupied seasonally, for long-term pastoral use. Cornish Bronze Age communities may have rotated their utilization of upland, lowland, and coastal zones. However, direct evidence for a connection between the inhabitants of lowland communities and upland settlements has not yet been found. Bodmin Moor. Following a period of reduced human activity in the Late Neolithic, the Bronze Age is characterized by an upsurge in upland settlement. On Bodmin Moor, a 1994 survey detected 1,601 stone hut circles, 2,123 cairns, and 978 hectares (9.78 km2) of enclosures and field systems, most of which probably date to the Bronze Age. A large number of probable Bronze Age settlements are found on valley slopes, as well as many more on exposed areas in the heart of the moor. Some settlements are densely concentrated, with many huts of similar size packed into a relatively small area, while others occupy a much larger area and are less densely settled, often consisting of a pattern of several small huts clustered around a single larger building. The Garrow and Roughtor area has the greatest settlement density, and also the most variation in hut morphology. This area, less than ten percent of the moor, has more than one-third of the total number of huts.A variety of main settlement types are found on Bodmin Moor. These include unfortified open settlements, with houses closely grouped together, and settlements built on high exposed hills, with small irregular enclosures which may have been used as gardens. Both of these types of site may have been the summer residences of pastoralists.Notable settlements include Leskernick Hill, dated c. 1690–1440 BCE and perhaps occupied until as late as 1000 BCE, one of the largest and best-preserved Middle Bronze Age sites on Bodmin Moor, with an area of around 21 hectares (0.21 km2) comprising 51 stone roundhouses divided between two settlement areas; Stannon Down, near St Breward, an Early Bronze Age ceremonial complex which was in use from c. 2490–1120 BCE, with settlement activity from c. 1500 BCE, consisting of around 25 roundhouses; Blacktor, where ninety-six huts are concentrated in an area of only 3 hectares (0.030 km2), with enclosures formed by joining huts together with short walling; Garrow Tor, a settlement with over 100 huts; and Brockabarrow Common, located on a ridge around 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level, which comprises 61 huts and 7 enclosures within an area of 4 hectares, a very complex settlement with a wide variety of hut forms and associated structures, implying long-term pastoral use. Cornish Killas. Hollow-set, or \\'sunken-floored\\' roundhouses are the predominant domestic structure in lowland settlements throughout the Cornish Middle Bronze Age. There are around twenty examples distributed across the lowlands of Cornwall. By the Late Bronze Age, structural evidence suggests that post-built roundhouses without hollow-set floors were being built in lowland settlements.Notable settlements include Trevisker, near St Eval, c. 1700–1300 BCE, the eponymous site for the Trevisker Ware pottery commonly found in Cornwall throughout the Bronze Age, consisting of two or three Bronze Age roundhouses, with a mixed economy based on growing cereals and keeping livestock; Trethellan Farm, near the River Gannel in Newquay, c. 1500 to 1300 BCE, an exceptionally well-preserved Bronze Age agricultural settlement which comprised at least seven roundhouses, and may have had some features of a planned settlement; Gwithian, a coastal agricultural settlement near the Red River which had three main Bronze Age occupation phases starting from c. 1800 BCE with a single structure, followed c. 1500 BCE by a farmstead consisting of post-built structures and field systems, with a major settlement phase c. 1300 to 900 BCE, consisting of several buildings which included a possible granary and craft workshops; Scarcewater, near St Stephen-in-Brannel, between the Tresillian and Fal rivers, which had a Middle Bronze Age phase, c. 1500 to 1100 BCE, comprising three hollow-set roundhouses, one of which may have stood for 300 years, followed after a probable hiatus by a Late Bronze Age phase, c. 1100–900 BCE, consisting of a single post-built roundhouse; Carnon Gate, c. 1500–1300 BCE, which consisted of a single roundhouse on a hill slope on the Carnon valley, probably built less than 50 metres from the river; Tremough, near Penryn, c. 2000 – 1100 BCE, which comprised five post-ring roundhouses which are unlike other Cornish Bronze Age Cornish roundhouses, and may have been ceremonial monuments rather than standard domestic structures, as well as two more conventional hollow-set Middle Bronze Age roundhouses c. 1500–1300 BCE, one of which provides rare evidence for metalworking in a domestic roundhouse; Penhale Moor, a Middle Bronze Age settlement which consisted of an isolated roundhouse; and Nansloe, Helston, which comprised two Middle Bronze Age sunken-floored roundhouses, and a third possible Late Bronze Age roundhouse. The Lizard. On Goonhilly Downs, a large plateau on the Lizard peninsula, the density of burial mounds suggests a high level of settlement during the second millennium BCE.Both Gabbroic clay and finished pots were probably transported by boat from here to other parts of Cornwall, perhaps by groups who were regularly visiting the Lizard to obtain clay and manufacturing pottery from it at their own settlements, in exchange for other commodities.Settlements near the coast include Kynance Gate, just north of Lizard Point, a 3 acre site built on a plateau of serpentine on the north side of a valley 600 yards from the sea around 215 feet (66 m) above sea level, comprising a group of stone-walled roundhouses enclosed with an 80 feet (24 m) diameter wall constructed around a natural cairn, and another group of unenclosed stone-walled roundhouses to the north; and Poldowrian, near Mullion, consisting of a single roundhouse built 100 metres from the current cliff edge, 500 feet (150 m) above sea level, in an area built on serpentine but very close to the gabbro bedrock. Further inland, settlements include Boden Vean, in St Anthony-in-Meneage, Lizard, 70 metres above sea level, comprising a single Middle Bronze Age sunken-floored roundhouse; and Trelan, Lizard, a late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age site apparently constructed between c. 2600 and 1500 BCE. West Penwith. Most of the West Penwith Bronze Age settlements that have been excavated were built upon higher ground. Settlements in the more fertile lowland valleys are likely to have existed, but probably are not visible above ground and are therefore more difficult to identify. Evidence of possible processing and consumption of food at St Buryan may indicate settlement activity.There may have been links between upland and lowland Penwith settlements, with lowland settlements permanently occupied, and upland settlements only occupied seasonally. The West Penwith Moors are of a relatively lower elevation, and so it is likely that they were more frequently occupied than other, higher upland areas like Bodmin Moor.In West Penwith, roundhouses are distributed in small numbers, within rectilinear or irregular field systems. Systematic field layouts are limited to a few hundred metres here, in contrast to the much more extensive Dartmoor reave systems. Faced stone walls filled with rubble core and a rab (gravel) floor are regularly found here, in common with other upland areas in Cornwall.Settlements include Sperris Croft, consisting of seven roundhouses aligned in a row at the top of a ridge; Wicca Round, a settlement 150 metres north of Sperris Croft comprising 3 ruined huts within field systems; and Bosiliack, in Madron parish, one of the largest Bronze Age roundhouse settlements in West Penwith, located on the side of a shallow valley 350 metres to the north-west of the Bosiliack entrance grave and around 180 metres above sea level, consisting of at least 13 stone-walled roundhouses in an approximately 70 by 40 metre (0.28 hectares) area. Scilly. Permanent and substantial human settlement of Scilly is thought to have begun c. 2000 BCE. It has been argued that the first settlers may have come from West Penwith, based on the similar entrance graves there. There are the remains of around 150 stone huts in Scilly, many of which probably date to the Bronze Age, as well as Bronze Age field systems, cairn cemeteries, and numerous entrance graves. Houses are found in groups of two or three, often joined, close to field systems, and close to cairns.Scilly features numerous settlement sites, ranging in size from individual stone roundhouses at Samson Flats, West Broad Ledge, and Little Bay, to small villages. Some of the larger excavated settlements include Nornour, south-east of St Martin\\'s, which was occupied from c. 1500 BCE to c. 500 BCE and appears to have had limited contact with the mainland throughout this period, comprising two stone huts and a third additional building; Porth Killier, St Agnes, a Bronze Age fishing and farming community comprising around three roundhouses; and Dolphin Town, located at the base of a hill near the east coast of Tresco, a few metres above sea level, where a wide range of pottery, three Middle Bronze Age roundhouses, and an early field system is found. Structures. Buildings. Domestic structures from the Early Bronze Age period are rare. They include the irregular oval-shaped, fairly flimsy, and probably short-lived Beaker-associated structure at Sennen, c. 2400 to 2100 BCE, which is the earliest Bronze Age structure known in Cornwall and may have been used for grain preparation, consisting of at least 8 post holes which may have supported a superstructure, probably enclosed by a fence; the \\'Beaker house\\' at Gwithian (c. 1890 to 1610 BCE), a homestead associated with early agriculture and Beaker pottery, built on a terrace within a stake-built wooden enclosure with a porched entrance and deep gullies along the front; and a small, insubstantial, and relatively temporary structure at Tremough, Penryn (c. 1900 to 1600 BCE), which was apparently the short-term home of a metallurgist.In the Middle Bronze Age, two main types of roundhouses are found. The first type, hollow-set (or \\'sunken-floored\\') roundhouses, are part of a regional architectural tradition found in the lowlands of Cornwall, where there are around twenty known examples. Radiocarbon dates from lowland sites show that hollow-set roundhouse building was mainly restricted to the period c. 1500 to 1000 BCE. Hollow-set roundhouses ranged from around 8 to 15 metres (26 to 49 ft) in diameter, and were built within a circular or oval stone-lined hollow cut into the ground. The internal face was lined with a low wattle and daub, sod, or local sedimentary rock wall surrounding a wooden (perhaps oak) load-bearing post-ring, which carried the weight of the conical roofs, perhaps constructed with rafters made from ash, which probably used rushes or straw as weatherproof thatching materials. Doorways were usually in the south or south-east, providing warmth, light, and protection from the prevailing winds. Not all hollow-set roundhouses were domestic structures. The roundhouse from Callestick, for example, is constructed differently and appears to have served a ritual function. The second type of roundhouse, mainly circular or oval stone-walled huts, predominated on upland settlements such as Bodmin Moor. Double or single-faced walls, probably around 3.5 feet (1.1 m) high and constructed from granite are typical, but there is considerable variation in the wall structure of this type of building. Dry stone walling may have been used as an alternative method of construction, used when massive slabs of granite were no longer easily obtainable. Floors were made from clay, with entrance passages and the area inside the entrance of the hut paved with stone. Roofs were conical, resting on the walls and supported by a central post-hole. Wattle or thatch was probably used as roofing material. Like lowland roundhouses, these buildings usually have a single, south facing entrance, sometimes with a porch. Some huts, such as those at Stannon, had fairly sophisticated stone-capped internal drainage systems, probably to remove the large volumes of water that would have accumulated in the walls of the hut after heavy rain. Timber structures may have been used to partition space within the house, and shelves may have been built around the walls. Non-structural post-holes suggest that some huts may have contained furniture such as dressers or beds. Huts vary widely in their dimensions, from less than 4 metres to more than 8 metres in diameter, with buildings having a surface area of up to 120 square metres (1,300 sq ft). Most buildings of this type fall within a range of 5–7 metres diameter, large enough for 4 or 5 people. Smaller huts may have only been used seasonally, perhaps for storage, or as livestock shelters or workshops. Walls often link huts together in a linear arrangement, and most are associated with field boundaries and enclosures. The wide variations of size, internal diameter, and wall construction method seen in these buildings  may represent different functions, household size, or status of the inhabitants. Roundhouses of this second type are widely distributed across the Cornish uplands.In Scilly, buildings are constructed from granite blocks, with 1–2.5 metre thick walls, double-faced with rubble or earth cores. Houses are typically built into terraced slopes, natural hollows, or middens, providing insulation against the wind and support for load-bearing walls. Houses are predominantly round, with a minority of oval buildings. The majority of second millennium BCE buildings are between 3.3 and 5.6 metres diameter.Other buildings are also found which are less typical. For instance, the roundhouse at Carnon Gate is stone-walled, like those of upland settlements, but hollow-set like other lowland roundhouses. Another unusual structure is found at Poldowrian, Lizard, where a Bronze Age roundhouse with an internal wooden post-ring, an entrance porch, and a cobbled pathway, has stone walls made of local serpentine. The circular post-ring roundhouses at Tremough, Penryn, are also not like other Bronze Age Cornish roundhouses, and more closely resemble the domestic structures that are found during this period in southern Britain as far west as east Devon. Field systems. Extensive prehistoric field systems were constructed in Cornwall from around the middle of the second millennium BCE and established by the end of the Middle Bronze Age, mainly concentrated in the west of Cornwall. In some parts of West Cornwall, enclosed field boundaries seem to have been constructed at a relatively early date. At Gwithian for instance, field boundaries may have been continually used from 1800 BCE to 800 BCE. Most of these boundary systems are significantly different from those of central southern and south-east Britain, and include \"a bewildering array of freeform styles, unhindered by predetermined conventions of linearity or accepted orientation\".As well as these diverse ad hoc boundary systems, the coaxial and rectilinear systems found east of Cornwall are found sporadically. Cornish coaxial field systems are thought to be a fragmentary regional variant of the Dartmoor reave systems.  They consist of granite-walled adjacent field boundaries forming a series of long parallel lines. They are primarily found in the uplands but also occur in coastal areas. Coaxial field systems are found in West Penwith, at Pennance, Wicca, and Chysauster; in the area inland from Mounts Bay at Godolphin; Lizard, on the gabbro rock  at Kestlemerris and Polcoverack; on Bodmin Moor, at Roughtor, Carne Downs, Watergate, Smallacombe, Hamatethy, and notably East Moor; and near the Tamar, at Kit Hill. According to Peter Herring, coaxial field systems were probably not only used for agriculture, but were also regarded as monuments due to the amount of work required to construct them and their impact on the landscape. Coaxial field systems continued to respect Neolithic monuments such as cairns and stone rows, which were often incorporated into their construction.In West Cornwall, c. 1000 BCE, field systems were changed, and coaxial systems were replaced with much more densely spaced rectangular enclosures (the so-called \\'Celtic fields\\') which were probably used to cultivate crops, unlike the coaxial fields.There is little evidence for enclosed fields in the lowland areas, but since there is evidence that lowland settlements practised livestock farming, it is likely that they built field boundaries that have not been detected, perhaps because they were constructed from sedimentary rock or wood rather than granite, or because they were not ditched like upland field systems. Tor enclosures. Natural rocky outcrops such as tors were artificially enhanced by stacking up more rock around them, creating a semi-artificial hillfort (\\'tor enclosures\\') that could be controlled and cultivated, with their use restricted, perhaps by local elite individuals. Examples include Roughtor, around 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level, and Stowe\\'s Pound, an enclosure built at the top of Stowe\\'s Hill, which is 381 metres (1,250 ft) above sea level. The Roughtor and Stowe\\'s Pound tor enclosures, both on Bodmin Moor, were probably originally constructed during the Neolithic, but were heavily structurally modified during the Bronze Age. Substantial settlement occurred around tor enclosures, and they may also have functioned as centres of communal ritual practices. Monuments. The first half of the second millennium BCE has been described as a period of monument construction unparalleled since the earlier Neolithic. Thousands of barrows and cairns were constructed in Cornwall during this period, along with numerous stone circles, stone rows, and other monumental structures.Prominent rocks were likely to have been culturally and spiritually significant to the inhabitants of upland areas such as Bodmin Moor and Penwith, and natural features such as hills, rivers, and especially rocky outcrops were particularly important places for deciding the location or alignment of ceremonial monuments, as were existing Neolithic structures and focal points. Many new monuments were constructed near to, in alignment with, within sight of, or on top of previously significant features. Large cairns are almost always found in prominent places, along ridges or beside older monuments. Numerous monuments on Bodmin Moor, such as many of the barrows at Stannon Down, are concentrated in the vicinity of or aligned with Roughtor, a prominent peak with a distinctive shape. The Leskernick Hill ritual landscape was probably planned in relation to previously existing Neolithic structures and alignments. In Penwith, The Pipers, The Merry Maidens, and several other monuments may have been built with respect to the previously built Late Neolithic cromlech and the later stone circle and cairns at Boscawen-Un.At the lowland settlements during the Middle Bronze Age, new types of specialized structures and purpose-built roundhouses, separate from the main settlement, were sometimes used for rituals. Andy Jones states that Middle Bronze Age communities in Cornwall were \"choosing to create formal ceremonial areas and buildings on the margins of settlements\", with a variety of forms that included square and circular shapes, with or without roofs. At Callestick, a circular building with a porch, near a probable settlement, may have been one such ceremonial monument. A Middle Bronze Age circular structure at Harlyn has been interpreted as a possible shrine. And at Trethellan, a small, 10.24 square metres (110.2 sq ft) square-floored stone building, which had been completely infilled with quartz blocks, seems to have been designed for interior darkness, appears to have only rarely been entered, and has evidence of grain deposits, all of which perhaps indicates a ritual function.Early to Middle Bronze Age freestanding timber post-hole monuments may be contemporaneous with roundhouse building, perhaps with some sort of symbolic relationship between the two types of structure. Such structures are found at Stannon, where timber settings have been found within a ring cairn; Belowda, where two timber post-rings are found; and Tremough, where an alignment of 5 timber post rings, in use through much of the second millennium BCE, is found. The structures at Tremough and Stannon were probably built near to their contemporaneous settlements. Barrows and cairns. Barrow building appears to have begun in Cornwall c. 2100 BCE, combining existing Neolithic traditions with a new ideology of monument building related to the enclosure of circular structures. A wide range of types are found, including bowl barrows, bell barrows, disc barrows, ring cairns, and tailed cairns. Barrows and cairns had a diverse range of uses, many of which were unrelated to burials. Some round barrows may have also been aligned with various celestial events.Barrows are commonly found in groups (\\'barrow cemeteries\\') including those of Davidstow Moor, St. Breock Downs, Botrea, and Cataclews. They usually occupy distinctive parts of the landscape such as plateaus or high elevations, but are often sited in locations that were not particularly conspicuous, perhaps implying an intention to contain the cemetery within a restricted space. Megaliths. A large number of megaliths, such as menhirs, stone circles, and stone rows, were raised in the Bronze Age. Menhirs probably functioned as memorial gravestones, and stone circles and stone rows functioned as the main ceremonial and processional sites, respectively. The tallest known menhir in Cornwall, now destroyed, was Maen Pearn at Constantine, which was 7.4 metres tall. Other menhirs which are still standing include two monuments both called the Pipers at St Buryan and Minions, the Blind Fiddler, the Old Man of Gugh in Scilly, the Tremenheere Longstone on the Lizard, and the Try, Gulval menhir.There are more than twenty stone circles in Cornwall, probably constructed in the early Bronze Age, mainly on Bodmin Moor and West Penwith. Many Cornish stone circles are smaller than those found in other regions. With the exception of the Duloe stone circle, which is made from quartzite, they are all made of granite, and may have been used for religious rituals. Stone circles appear to have been constructed in specific locations so that tors could be seen from them. They may have been constructed to mark the rising and setting of the sun in relation to features visible on the horizon from inside the circle. For example, Brown Willy is thought to mark sunrise and sunset at the equinox from six nearby stone circles, and on May Day, the sun rises through a cleft on Roughtor and shines into the Stannon stone circle. At the Goodaver stone circle, located on top of a ridge where there are no nearby tors, the large number of solar alignments may suggest that it served some sort of calendar function. In folklore, these stones are often depicted as humans turned to stone as punishment for breaking the sabbath, dancing, or hurling. Notable stone circles include the Merry Maidens at Boleigh and the Hurlers, a group of three stone circles on Bodmin Moor.There are eight stone rows in Cornwall. With the exception of Nine Maidens near St. Columb, they are all on Bodmin Moor. These include Carneglos, Buttern Hill, Craddock Moor, and Leskernick. The functions of stone rows may have been to connect less noticeable parts of the landscape, as well as marking the centres or boundaries of sacred areas. Entrance graves. In the far south-west, there is evidence of distinctive burial customs that exhibit local characteristics and Atlantic influence. A type of chambered tombs, called entrance graves, are dated to the Early Bronze Age, c. 2000–1500 BCE, and restricted to the western edge of Cornwall, mainly in Scilly, with around a dozen examples in West Penwith. Cornish entrance graves are part of an Early Bronze Age monument building tradition along the Atlantic Façade, where there are similar monuments in County Waterford, south-east Ireland (the Tramore tombs), and south-west Scotland (the Bargrennan cairns). Small numbers of somewhat comparable monuments are also found in the Channel Islands and Brittany.   Andy Jones speculates that communities in western Cornwall may have intended to demonstrate their connections to other communities which shared a distinct \\'Atlantic identity\\' on the Atlantic façade by borrowing from their burial traditions and integrating them with local practices. It is not yet certain whether entrance graves were first constructed in Penwith or Scilly.There are around 13 entrance graves in West Penwith, including Bosiliack, Ballowall, Gulval, Tregeseal, and Tregiffian. Mainland entrance graves are small circular kerb-lined mounds or cairns, with an undifferentiated short passage and internal chamber, and capped with large flat granite slabs. Sizes vary considerably, from 16 metres diameter at Tolcreeg, to only 5 metres diameter at Bosiliack. Human remains are usually deposited, generally in the form of internments of the cremated disarticulated bones of multiple individuals. There are chambers similar to those of the Penwith entrance graves incorporated into much larger and more complex structures at Ballowall and Chapel Carn Brea.Entrance graves are much more numerous in Scilly than in Penwith, with at least eighty and perhaps almost a hundred examples. These include the group at Porth Hellick, Bant\\'s Carn, Obadiah\\'s Barrow, and Knackyboy Carn. There are several differences between the Scillonian entrance graves and the examples on the mainland. Entrance graves in Scilly are often found in groups, whereas in Penwith all except the two at Treen occur individually. Scillonian entrance grave chambers are sometimes described as \\'boat-shaped\\', compared to the rectangular or wedge-shaped chambers in Penwith. And unlike in Penwith, the location of entrance graves in Scilly is consistently associated with rocky outcrops, and many of the structures incorporate earth-set boulders into their structures. Ceremonial complexes. Diverse complexes of funerary and non-funerary monuments are found throughout Cornwall. One of the most thoroughly studied and excavated of these ceremonial complexes is the site of Stannon Down, in the south-west of Bodmin Moor. Stannon consists of five monument groups, including a wide variety of monument forms that were probably associated with a wide range of ritual practices. The Stannon complex includes a total of 17 or 18 ring cairns, tailed cairns, and more complicated forms, and one or two stone-lined cists which may have been used for inhumation burials. The Stannon stone circle lies 800 metres to the south. The complex was probably in use for more than a millennium from c. 2500 BCE to c. 1100 BCE, with settlement activity beginning after c. 1500 BCE. In general there is very little evidence for burial or funerary activity here. Based on organic remains, it is possible that ceremonial feasting took place within the ceremonial complex. Andy Jones suggests that the cairns formed \"a coherent group of monuments which were part of a wider landscape cosmology which involved the grouping of particular monument types and the referencing of prominent rocks and tors.\" Subsistence. From 1500 BCE, by which time the majority of the population of Cornwall probably belonged to farming communities, there was significant expansion of agricultural land. In general, animal husbandry predominated, with arable farming mainly restricted to coastal areas where the soil was more suitable for growing crops.Although pollen core evidence suggests the possibility that limited cereal cultivation took place at Stannon Down, the morphology of the field systems at sites at East Moor and Roughtor, as well as ecological and palynological evidence, indicates that the economy of Bodmin Moor was overwhelmingly pastoral. In contrast, lowland and coastal settlements such as Gwithian and Trethellan were mixed arable and livestock farming societies, supplemented by activities such as hunting, fishing, or gathering wild foods.Evidence for Bronze Age animal husbandry is found at sites such as Gwithian where, in addition to arable and pasture farming, woods and scrub were utilized to provide forage and cover for pigs and red deer. Domesticated and semi-domesticated animal bone finds at Trethellan and Gwithian include domestic cattle, ovicaprids, pig, and roe and red deer. Evidence for transhumance is found at upland sites by the Middle Bronze Age. During the summer months, livestock were probably moved to upland areas to utilize rough grazing land and remove them from the crop and hay fields in lowland settlements. People from the lowlands may have accompanied their livestock to the uplands, protecting them and processing their milk while living in seasonally occupied unenclosed settlements.Crops that were cultivated included wheat, barley, Celtic beans, and occasionally oats. Different sites have yielded various assemblages of evidence for arable crops. At the Trethellan site crops included wheat, Celtic beans, and flax, which were sown in the spring. Emmer, spelt, and bread wheat were probably sown here in the autumn. A structure at Trethellan has been identified as a possible open-air oven, perhaps indicating that bread was baked here. At Tremough, wheat, barley, Celtic beans, and oats were some of the crops identified. Barley was the main crop at both the Trethellan and Tremough settlements. At Trevilson, charred plant remains provide evidence for the cultivation of wheat, barley, garden pea, and perhaps oats. Additionally a large cache of Celtic bean is found here. At Porth Killier, Scilly, barley, emmer wheat and Celtic bean were among the crops identified. A cache of naked barley dated c. 2198–1772 BCE is also found in Scilly at East Porth, Samson, which is the earliest direct evidence for arable farming in Scilly. At Gwithian, soil may have been enhanced by addition of compost and manure, and there is also rare evidence for the use of spades and ard ploughs.Coastal and riverine communities supplemented their diet with marine foods. At Gwithian the settlement is near a river and close to the sea, which would have provided a source of fish, evidenced by fish bone finds and a single whale bone. Pebble tools, including line winders and net sinkers, suggest that both offshore and deep sea fishing took place here. Diet at Trethellan was probably supplemented by gathering molluscs such as mussels and limpets. In Scilly, subsistence was mainly based on fishing, collecting shellfish, and hunting sea mammals. At Porth Killier for instance, the inhabitants had a mainly marine-based diet consisting of seabirds, fish, seals, and shellfish, and several limpet middens are found.Diet was further augmented by foraging for wild foods including hazelnut, sloe, and crab apple. Wild foods at Trethellan included cleavers, nettles, sheep\\'s sorrel, wild radish, chickweed, and mallow in spring, and sloe, rosehip, hawthorn berries, and hazelnuts in the autumn. At Tremough, hedgerow plants such as hazelnuts, hawthorn berries, blackberries, and elderberries may have been collected as food.Analysis of the residue of a cup at Treligga indicate that it may have been used to consume mead or some similar substance. Analysis of residues from pottery sherds at Trethellan show that ruminant dairy products were made here. Lipid analysis on the ceramics found that 36% of the sherds analysed contained cow, sheep, or goat fats. Ritual. Funerals. There is a strong preference for cremation funerals in the Beaker period and Early Bronze Age, and inhumation burials are rare in Cornwall throughout the Bronze Age. Both inhumation and cremation burials have been occasionally found in the vicinity of Middle Bronze Age roundhouse settlements, and an inhumation and a cremation occur together at two sites, Lousey and Polhendra.Beaker-associated cremations are relatively rare in Britain as a whole, but in Cornwall they are predominant, perhaps suggesting a different ideology towards the dead. In Cornwall, the only definite Beaker-associated inhumation is at Lousey Barrow, St. Juliot, though there was also a cremation burial even here. Cremation vessels may contain the remains of a single individual, such as the cremation from the entrance grave at Bosiliack, or multiple persons, such as the cist at Trelowthas barrow which contained the remains of several people, and the Early Bronze Age cremation at Harlyn, which probably represents the remains of up to five children. As well as cremation deposits that may represent the complete remains of a single person, a number of sites feature token or partial cremation burials, such as Treligga, Davidstow, and Chysauster, where cremation remains were only a fraction of what would be expected for a complete individual.Examples of inhumation burials are found at Harlyn Bay, where an Early Bronze Age cist contained the skeleton of a young female accompanied by a large quartz-rich stone, and Constantine Island, where an inhumation burial within a cist contained a crouched male radiocarbon dated to the Middle Bronze Age. There is also a single example of a multiple inhumation burial from the Watch Hill site. It has been suggested that funerary rituals did not necessarily require burial of the dead, perhaps providing a plausible explanation for why the proportion of inhumation burials in barrows is so low. Grave goods. Ceramics, mainly Trevisker Ware,  are the most common artefact deposition in barrows. Metal is much less common, and only six barrows contain gold. Barrows are frequently associated with small-scale depositions, often stone and especially quartz, which was probably thought to have symbolic properties, and was ritually deposited in various contexts during the second millennium BCE. Stone depositions in burial contexts include a small pile of beach pebbles from the inhumation burial at Gwithian, a heart-shaped pebble from one of the cremations at Boscregan, two jasper pebbles mixed with a cremation at Bosporthenis, and flint, pebbles and a large quartz crystal in the grave at Caerloggas. Metal depositions include bronze daggers, which are sometimes deposited in barrows after c. 1750. A bronze axe was found in the cist at Harlyn, which is an unusual find in burials. Rillaton Barrow, dated to the early second millennium BCE and the richest of the Cornish barrows, contained the famous Rillaton gold cup, and now lost items including a dagger, a rivet, bone or ivory, and (possibly faience) beads. This barrow may be associated with some elite individual from the Stowe\\'s Pound tor enclosure. With the exception of the Rillaton barrow, artefact finds indicative of high-status are rarely found together with individual human remains. Multiple-person cremation deposits, in contrast, were regularly associated with artefacts. Andy Jones suggests that this differential treatment might be intended to emphasize a \\'community of ancestors\\' while simultaneously attaching less importance to individuality. Ritual abandonment and destruction. Roundhouses were associated with a variety of ritual practices, such as placing offerings in pits and postholes during the building stage, the ritualized destruction of buildings with fire, and the building of mounds over demolished buildings. At Penhale Moor, a roundhouse was symbolically \\'killed\\' by thrusting a spear into the floor, which was followed by controlled destruction by fire and the infilling of the roundhouse interior. At Trethellan Farm, buildings were symbolically buried at the end of their \\'lives\\', and were dismantled, levelled, and covered with earth and rubble. At Gwithian, some buildings were deliberately destroyed, and the ruins were covered with rubbish consisting of bones and other objects. Widespread ritualized demolition and abandonment of sunken-floored roundhouse settlements seems to have occurred at sites such as Trethellan, Tremough, and Nansloe Farm. The reasons for this practice are unknown. Perhaps the death of a prominent member of the community may have been interpreted as a signal that the lifetime of the settlement had come to an end.Other objects were apparently also liable to ritualized destruction. In the Late Bronze Age, socketed axe heads were deliberately destroyed and deposited, either individually or in hoards. Querns may have been used symbolically in the final closure of structures. At Trethellan Farm, a quern was apparently ritually smashed and burned. Joanna Brück suggests that in this case the death of a house was \"accompanied by the death of one of the objects central to the household\\'s material and social reproduction. Like its user, it was burnt, broken and buried at the end of its life.\" Metal exploitation. It is widely believed that Cornish alluvial deposits containing cassiterite and native gold were exploited during the Bronze Age. Alluvial gold may have been extracted from Cornish streams from c. 2000 BCE, or possibly even earlier, in the chalcolithic, and was perhaps the main source of the gold used in the British and Irish Early Bronze Age. Tin extraction probably began in Cornwall in the early Bronze Age, and perhaps as early as c. 2300 BCE. There is some limited direct evidence for tin production and  extraction. Recent excavations have found large quantities of cassiterite (tin ore) pebbles in two Early Bronze Age pits, and traces of tin have been found on a Beaker era artefact. At Trevisker, cassiterite pebbles and evidence of bronze-working were found in a building, and at Caerloggas, St Austell, the barrow yielded seven fragments of tin slag associated with a dagger. A cassiterite pebble is found at an Early Bronze Age site at Tremough, and over 100 cassiterite pebbles have been found together with Trevisker Ware pottery at an Early to Middle Bronze Age site at Tregurra valley, Truro. A variety of tool finds including antler picks and wooden shovels indicate mining activity. Hammerstones, perhaps used to mine ore, are found at several sites including Gwithian and Trethellan. It is possible that tin mining in Cornwall took place on a larger scale than can be currently demonstrated, due to evidence being lost due to subsequent tin mining during later periods.A 2022 X-ray fluorescence and microwear analysis study of Bronze Age stone tools from Sennen, Lelant, and Truro found that the tools had been used to process semi-hard minerals, and detected traces of cassiterite tin ore on six implements, providing what the authors describe as \"the earliest secure evidence for tin exploitation in Britain\". The study concludes that the results \"strongly suggest that Cornish tin sources were being processed from as early as c. 2300–2200 calBC, and that ores from these sources were integrated into the circulation of metals, first across Britain and Ireland and subsequently in the wider Atlantic region and beyond\". Crafts. Lithics. Nodular flint or chert is not found natively in Cornwall, and would have been imported as unworked nodules between the fourth and second millennia BCE. The chalk outcrop at Beer Head in south-east Devon is often suggested as a possible source of Cornish Bronze Age flint, but other sites are also possible. Nodular material can also be found in the Blackdown Hills surrounding Beer Head to the east, north, and west, and the Orleigh Court outcrop north of Dartmoor, which is closer to Cornwall. Towards the end of the second millennium the import of nodular flint became less common, and local pebbles from surrounding beaches were used, providing a varied and plentiful source of flint and chert. Flint fragments are found at sites on Bodmin Moor, such as Stannon Down, where flint is not found natively, and it would have to have been transported here, perhaps in the form of flint pebbles from the south coast.Stone working has been described as rudimentary at some sites. According to Arthur ApSimon, stone artefacts from Trevisker \"show that the Bronze Age settlement had no real tradition of flint working, in sharp contrast to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age inhabitants of Cornwall.\" Flint working at Trethellan is similarly described as simplistic and lacking in innovation. There are few flint fragments here, but there are some examples of prepared cores, indicating that flint objects were produced on the site. It has been suggested that the limited evidence for stone tools is because the people at Trethellan relied instead on metal tools, which they took with them after the village had been abandoned.Stone and flint knives, axes, and arrowheads are found at several sites. A ripple-flaked flint knife of Early Bronze Age form is found at Tremough, and a fairly high quality flint knife, probably not made of local flint, is found at Carnon Gate. A simple parallel-sided blade, two plano-convex knives, a greenstone axe, and a greenstone adze or hoe are found at Stannon. At Trevisker, stone knives are made from typical north Cornish coast beach pebbles, which has limited uses. Two objects that may have been stone axes are found at Trethellan. Flint arrowheads are found at Gwithian.Quern-stones, used for grinding grain to make flour, are commonly found. Saddle querns (the lower, stationary quern stones) are found at sites including Stannon Down, Try, Boscawen-Un, Davidstow, Trethellan, Gwithian, and Trelowthas. A large number of mullers (the upper, mobile quern-stone) are found at Gwithian. Saddle querns, mullers, and three pestles perhaps also used to process cereals, are found at Scarcewater.A number of stone artefacts are associated with metalworking. At Gwithian there are stone moulds, including two stone axe moulds, and hammerstones perhaps used to mine ore. A stone mould and two hammerstones are found at Trethellan. A stone racloir mould is found at Trevalga.Scrapers, which are associated with various functions including wood, bone, and leather work, as well as food preparation, are found at Lelant, Stannon, and Scarcewater. At Gwithian there are numerous finds associated with leather working, including flensing stones, lapstones, slickstones and rubbing stones. Many of the rubbing stones found at Trethellan had flattened surfaces, and may have been used to smooth animal hides.Other stone artefacts include part of a stone bowl found at Trethellan Farm, and cupped pebbles which are found in several barrows and may have been used as nutcrackers. Pottery. Gabbroic clay, which is rich in feldspar, olivines, and other minerals, is found on the Lizard peninsula, which contains the largest outcrop of gabbro rock in Britain, mainly in a 1 square kilometre (0.39 sq mi) area near Zoar. This clay was transported from here to areas where it does not occur locally and used to make pottery in Cornwall from the Neolithic until the Romano-British period, which is unusual, as most pottery in prehistory was typically made locally using clay from nearby sources. The earliest Bell Beaker pottery found in Cornwall is often made from a wide variety of local clays, which in some cases, such as the pottery from Poldowrian, on the Lizard, was gabbroic. But gabbroic clay was also transported to sites such as Sennen, Treyarnon, and Nancemere, where it was mixed with local clay and made into Beaker pottery. The later Food Vessels and Collared Urns were also made from a variety of clays, but with a substantial number made from gabbroic clay. Trevisker Ware in Cornwall, manufactured from c. 2000 BCE until the end of the millennium, was predominantly made from gabbroic clay.Beaker pottery is found in Cornwall from c. 2400–1700 BCE, replacing the preceding late Neolithic Grooved ware, of which there are only a few examples in Cornwall. At the site at Sennen, radiocarbon dated to c. 2400–2100 BCE, the earliest securely dated Cornish Beaker pottery is found associated with the earliest known Bronze Age structure in Cornwall. Relatively early Beaker pottery is also found at the Lower Boscaswell site, c. 2250–1950 BCE, along with the first known burnt mound (probably used for cooking in this case) found in Cornwall, which is currently the only example of a Beaker-associated burnt mound in Britain. A relatively high concentration of Bell Beaker pottery is found in West Penwith.Some Cornish Beaker finds, such as the locally made gabbroic pottery from Poldowrian dated c. 1890 BCE, are thought to belong to a relatively early ceramic tradition (Humphrey Case\\'s \\'style 2\\'), although the earliest Maritime and All-Over-Corded Beaker styles are not found at all in Cornwall, and some Beaker pottery is found together with Food Vessels and Trevisker Ware. Furthermore, Beaker pottery in burial contexts is regularly associated with cremation rather than the single-inhumation typical of earlier Beaker burials in other parts of Britain, all of which implies that most of the Beaker ceramics in Cornwall are of relatively late date. At Try, Gulval, radiocarbon dating of an incomplete handled Beaker suggests that Beaker pottery continued to circulate until as late as c. 1700 BCE. At the earliest Cornish Beaker sites, Beaker vessels are associated with food preparation, consumption, and sharing, perhaps at social rituals. This may have gradually changed to ritual use associated with monuments by the end of the Beaker period.Food Vessels, Collared Urns, and Trevisker Ware pottery styles begin to appear c. 2000 BCE. Examples of Food Vessels are found at Carvinack, Treligga, Watch Hill (c. 1920–1680 BCE), and perhaps Cataclews (c. 2030–1680 BCE). Collared Urns, usually associated with cremation remains, are found in barrows at Trannak, Bears Down, Gaverigan, Davidstow (dated c. 2500–1900 BCE, based on charcoal beneath the urn, probably giving an incorrect early date), Colliford (1720–1960 BCE), and the entrance grave at Tregiffian (c. 1980–1680 BCE, based on charcoal inside the urn).Trevisker Ware is thought to have originated in Cornwall c. 2000 BCE, and is initially found in funerary or ritual contexts. Trevisker Ware was the most common ceramic style of the Cornish Early Bronze Age, and the almost exclusively used ceramic type of the Cornish Middle Bronze Age. Trevisker Ware has also been found in Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Kent, Wales, Dalkey Island in County Dublin, and Brittany. It continued to be produced in Cornwall for almost a millennium, and ceramic finds from Gwithian indicate that Trevisker Ware was still used in the tenth century BCE. It began to be replaced around the end of the second millennium by Late Bronze Age Plain Ware. Parker Pearson suggests that Trevisker Ware developed from the preceding locally made Collared Urns, Cordoned Urns, and Food Vessels. Alternatively, Andy Jones argues that Trevisker Ware developed primarily from the earlier Grooved Ware, as well as other late Neolithic pottery styles. Trevisker Ware ceramics are usually biconical or have curved sides, with strengthened rims, decorated above the girth with parallel lines, zig-zags, or chevrons, using cord, combs, fingertips, or fingernails. Trevisker Ware vessels include large storage jars, medium-sized storage, cooking, and eating vessels, and smaller vessels for eating and drinking.  Like some of the preceding Grooved Ware, Beakers, Food Vessels, and Collared Urns in Cornwall, Trevisker Ware was usually produced from distinctive gabbroic clays from the Lizard peninsula, and both the pottery and clay itself were transported from the Lizard, in some cases a considerable distance. Direct evidence for pottery production is scarce, but the presence of unfinished pots and raw gabbroic clay at Gwithian show that ceramics were produced at this site. It has been suggested that the spread of Trevisker pottery in the later Bronze Age may be connected with increased metal prospecting, trading, and exploitation.On Scilly, a parallel ceramic tradition exists, which differs from the Trevisker style of the mainland, with less complex, mainly horizontal lines of decoration. Some vessels are also found here in the Trevisker style. Ceramics on Scilly were probably made from local clays. At Annet Farm, on St Agnes, there is evidence for clay extraction and possibly ceramic production.Late Bronze Age Plain Ware pottery, from perhaps c. 1000 BCE to 800 BCE, includes simple straight-walled jars and carinated bowls. Only undecorated (\\'Plain\\') Ware is found in Cornwall, the Decorated Ware found elsewhere in Southern Britain is not found. Like the Trevisker Ware, Plain Ware continued to be produced using gabbroic clay. Metalwork. A range of metal artefacts have been discovered, some of which may have been locally produced. At Gwithian for instance, clay and stone moulds, hammerstones, and anvils indicate small-scale metalworking. At the Trethellan site, in addition to a small number of bronze artefacts, a stone mould, possible hammerstones, and copper alloy waste were found, suggesting that secondary metalworking may have been practised here. At a domestic structure in Tremough c. 1900–1600  BCE, several items, including a cassiterite pebble, stone chisel moulds, a socketed hammer, a socketed axe, and droplets of copper alloy, indicate that this was probably the home of a metallurgist. Another probable metallurgist\\'s house dating to c.1400–1300 BCE is found at Trevalga. A mould for a copper alloy racloir, a triangular blade with a central perforation, commonly found in France at the time but with only four examples of this type found in Britain, is found here, perhaps indicating that local metalsmiths were familiar with contemporary French metalwork forms, and may have been producing such work for export.Gold objects are rare, but relatively densely concentrated. The Trevose Head, Cataclews, and Harlyn Bay area in St Merryn parish comprises the largest collection of Early Bronze Age gold and metalwork in South West Britain. Notable gold artefacts include the famous Rillaton gold cup, recovered from a stone cist in the Rillaton barrow. It is dated c. 1950–1750 BCE, and is said to be similar to the Fritzdorf gold cup in its handle construction and rivets.Additionally, a total of four gold lunulae are known, two from a cist at Harlyn Bay, one from a barrow (or perhaps a marsh) in St. Juliot, and one found either at Paul or, more likely, at Gwithian, perhaps at Trevarnon Round. Lunulae are high-status, flat, crescent-shaped gold collars, often decorated with geometric designs that are in many cases very similar to those found on Bell Beaker pottery. They almost certainly originated in Ireland, where the vast majority of examples are found, and circulated along the Atlantic Façade around the beginning of the second millennium BCE. As well as Ireland and Cornwall, lunulae are also found in Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Normandy. Outside of Cornwall, lunulae are only rarely found in barrow contexts. The presence of traces of tin in the gold lunulae from Harlyn Bay and St. Juliot suggest that the gold may derive from a local Cornish alluvial source.Of the four Cornish lunulae, the St. Juliot and Gwithian lunulae and one of the Harlyn Bay lunulae are of Classical type, the most accomplished of all the lunulae styles. They are the only confirmed examples of this type found outside of Ireland, where they may have been manufactured and then exported to Cornwall. The other Harlyn Bay lunula is of Provincial type, a style which is almost never found in Ireland. It has been suggested that Provincial lunulae can be identified with specific individual smiths. The Harlyn Bay Provincial lunula is supposed to have been made by the same smith who made the St Potan and Kerivoa lunulae found in Brittany, all of which seem to have been decorated using an identical tool. Rather than producing lunulae and then transporting them, itinerant smiths may have transported raw gold ingots or obtained raw materials locally, travelling by sea with a portable smithy and producing lunulae near where they would be sold, a lifestyle that would have required long distance communication, organization, and political tolerance for such activities. Andy Jones however believes that all four Cornish lunulae were made in Ireland, and more recent studies have disputed the \\'itinerant smith\\' model, showing that, while smiths may sometimes have travelled from place to place, they were usually controlled by the local hierarchy. At Gwithian, the prodigious metalworking activity that occurred here throughout the Bronze Age has been explained as multiple smiths working within a small family industry, who probably did not travel far from their local area.Early Bronze Age daggers have been found from sites at Penatilly, Sennen, Trewinard, and Trelowarren. Styles include Camerton-Snowshill daggers, dated by accompanying pottery to after c. 2000 BCE, which are found at the Mullion, Caerloggas, Harlyn Bay, Pelynt,  and Rillaton sites, and knife-daggers, found at Fore Down (radiocarbon dated c. 1900–1740 BCE) and Rosecliston, Newquay (radiocarbon dated c. 1881–1624 BCE). The Pelynt sword hilt, also known as the Pelynt dagger, dated c. 1350–1100 BCE and of Aegean type, apparently was not found at a barrow in Pelynt and may not even have been found in the area. It may have been inserted into a mound at a relatively late date.A copper \\'ox-hide\\' ingot weighing 72 kilograms (159 lb) was discovered on the seabed near Looe in 1985. Ingots of this type are generally dated to the second millennium BCE, are usually found in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas, and are rare in Britain.A number of metal hoards are found towards the end of the Bronze Age, including the Towednack hoard, comprising two twisted gold bar torcs, gold bracelets, and gold rods, the Morvah hoard of gold bracelets, and the Mylor Axe hoard. Other crafts. The discovery of flax seeds and a clay spindle whorl and weights at the Trethellan site indicate that small-scale textile production was practised here. Textiles are rarely preserved, but at Harlyn Bay mineralized textile fragments are found, and the imprint of a woven object is found in the clay under a barrow at Carvinack.At Gwithian, a diverse range of stone, bone, and shell artefacts are found which were probably used in wood, textile, leather, and metal working, possibly in specialized workshops.In Scilly, massive stone bowls and troughs and residues on pottery suggest that large-scale processing of oils from marine animals occurred here, probably for export. Amber, glass, and faience. Amber is relatively rare in Cornwall during the Bronze Age. The few examples, which include a lump of amber from Caerloggas, an amber V-perforated button from Boscregan and another of the same type near Woolley barrow, and one amber bead from Stannon and another from Trevassack Hill, Hayle, were probably obtained from the Wessex culture to the east.Faience (\\'glazed composition\\'), in this context, is a non-ceramic material with a quartz core and glaze, mixed with a plant-ash flux to assist fusion of the quartz grains. The glaze also contained copper, producing a distinctive turquoise colour. In British and Irish beads, tin appears to have been added to the faience paste, which served no purpose but may have been symbolic, or a socially significant act of conspicuous consumption. Faience would have been a prestigious novelty item, which may have been thought to have magical properties. The knowledge required to make faience probably arrived in Britain c. 2000 BCE, perhaps from contact with central European communities who were importing tin. Faience beads are found at several sites, including Hendraburnick Down, Boscregan, and Leskernick. The reported \\'glass\\' beads from Rillaton Barrow, now lost, were probably faience. Star-shaped beads were found at Stannon Down, Trelowthas, and Knackyboy Cairn. Some faience beads were clearly made locally, including the star-shaped bead from Stannon and the beads from Boscregan. Art. A regional tradition of rock art is found in Cornwall where cup-marks are made on stones. Originating in the Neolithic, they subsequently were found on Bronze Age barrows and roundhouses in the second millennium BCE. More than thirty cup-mark sites are found in Cornwall.Cup-marked stones may have been used to refer to links between barrow sites and other parts of the landscape, as well as to the people participating at rituals at barrows. Cup-marked stones in barrows may have played an especially important role in Early Bronze Age North Cornwall.. In this region, a large number of round barrows at sites including Tregulland, Starapark, Tichbarrow, and Treligga contain cup-marked stones.Cup-markings are found on stones deposited inside Middle Bronze Age roundhouses, as well as on larger stones integrated into their structure. In roundhouses, cup-marked stones may have been \"powerful symbols associated with previous occupants or ancestors, and perhaps functioned as protective amulets.\" Some of these stones may have been obtained from places in the landscape that were perceived as somehow \\'powerful\\'. Trade and cultural networks. Artefacts found in Cornwall such as the gold lunulae, a type which almost certainly originated in Ireland, the Rillaton gold cup, which probably represents a common tradition of metalcraft across northwest Europe, and the Pelynt sword hilt, probably made in Mycenaean Greece, demonstrate that Cornwall was part of a large and expansive trade network from at least the Early Bronze Age.At the beginning of the second millennium BCE, social and economic ties between Cornwall and Atlantic communities such as those of Ireland and Brittany were probably more intensive than those between Cornwall and other parts of southern Britain. Later in the Bronze Age, there is evidence for greater contact with the Wessex culture, including the use of Trevisker Ware outside of Cornwall to the east, and the presence of \\'Wessex II\\' artefacts such as Camerton-Snowshill daggers and pygmy cups in Cornwall.Genetic evidence and shared traditions such as megalithic tomb building demonstrate substantial interaction and migration of people along the Atlantic Façade already during the Neolithic. Continuing contact during the Bronze Age is demonstrated by the widespread occurrence of artefacts such as Bell Beaker pottery, and implied by the evidence for the existence of Bronze Age sewn-plank boats. It has been suggested that the long and dangerous sea voyages that allowed material culture and ideology to travel along the Atlantic façade were unlikely to have taken place for economic reasons, and may have been rituals or quests of some sort, perhaps legitimizing members of elite groups or bestowing fame on those who undertook them. Funerary traditions such as the burials at Harlyn and the entrance graves from West Penwith and Scilly, and the gold lunulae from Harlyn Bay, St Juliot, and Gwithian, are associated with a wider Atlantic tradition and indicative of an enduring network of cultural and economic exchange with other cultures of the Atlantic Bronze Age. The three Classical lunulae found in Cornwall, the only confirmed examples of this type outside of Ireland, imply strong links between Cornwall and Ireland during the late 3rd millennium BCE, perhaps driven by the export of tin and gold to south-west Ireland. It is likely that a significant proportion of the gold used to make artefacts in Bronze Age Britain and Ireland was sourced in Cornwall. Analysis of 50 Irish gold artefacts found that the chemical composition of these objects was not consistent with any known Irish gold source, and instead suggests that south-west Britain, perhaps Cornwall, was the most likely source. This may imply that gold used in Irish artefacts was deliberately obtained from distant, \\'mysterious\\' sources. The Harlyn Bay site comprises the largest and richest finds from any Early Bronze Age complex in Cornwall, and may have been an important prehistoric port for the exchange of goods, ideas, monumental styles, and marriage partners within a network of coastal communities along the Atlantic façade.Recent studies have shown that the tin and gold (but not the copper) used to manufacture the Nebra sky disc probably originated from Cornwall. The gold was most likely to have been obtained from the Carnon River. In 2020, a small spiral ring made of gold wire was found near Ammerbuch-Reusten, Tübingen, with a female skeleton directly dated to the Early Bronze Age c. 1861–1616 BCE, the earliest securely dated precious metal find in South-West Germany. Analysis of the gold showed that the gold probably derived from Cornwall, again specifically from the Carnon River.Chemical and isotopic analysis of several tin ingots from five sites in the Eastern Mediterranean c. 1530–1300 BCE showed relatively high indium concentration, typical of Cornish cassiterite. The study suggests that the tin for these ingots was most likely to have been obtained from Carnmenellis granite. The study argues that the collapse of eastern trade routes caused by the decline of the Levant states interrupted tin supplies, leading to a search for new tin sources from Europe and Britain. The shift in the tin trade to Europe, and specifically Cornwall, was contemporaneous with the rise of the Mycenaean civilization.Trevisker Ware ceramics, which originated in Cornwall, are occasionally found much further away in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, South Wales, Dublin, and Brittany. Some examples, including a Trevisker Ware vessel dated to c. 1600–1320 BCE found nearly 500 kilometres (310 mi) in Kent were made using gabbroic clay from the Lizard and may have been manufactured at Trethellan. Pottery at Hambledon Hill, in Dorset is also made from gabbroic clay from the Lizard, and the presence of Cornish heath (Erica vagans) at this site may indicate that prestige goods or raw materials including gabbroic clay were transported here from the Lizard peninsula. More usually however, Trevisker Ware found far away from Cornwall is made from non-gabbroic clay, implying that potters were familiar enough with Trevisker Ware styles to produce similar ceramics locally. Social organization. Important power centres included the Harlyn Bay area, the Colliford, Rillaton, and Pelynt group, the Mount\\'s Bay area, the groups of settlements in West Penwith and the Lizard, and the various barrow groups in North and Central Cornwall.The introduction of new types of weapons, expanding trade networks, prestige items including gold torcs and armrings, rich barrows like Rillaton, and structural modifications to tor enclosures, may imply the existence of a small local warrior elite in Cornwall by the Late Bronze Age. Christie suggests that a small group of elite \\'lunulae wearers\\' may have emerged in the Early Bronze Age, perhaps resulting in a social hierarchy that continued throughout the second millennium. William O\\'Brien has proposed a similar contemporary elite group of \\'lunula lords\\' in Ireland associated with copper metallurgy, who controlled copper supplies and wore gold to demonstrate their high status and display their wealth.Christopher Tilley proposes that, rather than attempting to control land, crops, animals, raw materials, or prestige goods, Cornish Bronze Age elites instead focussed on controlling \"knowledges deemed essential to the reproduction and well-being of the social group\". According to Tilley, the construction and control of monuments was one of the main instruments for the reproduction of power, and played a principal role in the creation and preservation of authority. Tilley argues that monuments were used by a class of ritual specialists who guided and instructed the rest of the population, emphasizing the spiritual significance and history of these sacred places in a continuing process where previous Neolithic traditions and ideas surrounding monuments and topography were modified and appropriated, to legitimize the contemporary society and its associated power structures.Alternatively Peter Herring argues that the social structure of upland farming communities on Bodmin Moor in the Middle Bronze Age is reflected in the landscape organization seen in the field systems, which Herring suggests seem to have been constructed by people who knew the land well and had an interest in their successful functioning, and so represents the result of a collective form of decision-making rather than an authoritarian imposition from above. Herring argues that settlements may have produced specialized goods, perhaps necessitating an extensive exchange system organized by some sort of local authority similar to a prehistoric \\'district council\\', which was perhaps composed of the same members of society as the lower levels of individuals, households, and cooperatives, and may have performed functions such as controlling access to summer grazing land, in the interests of the community as a whole.Barbara Bender summarizes the social hierarchy at the Leskernick Hill settlement:. Stonehenge was being built 250 miles to the east and there were powerful chieftains, drinking from gold cups, wearing gold lunulae, much closer to hand;. perhaps even as close as Rough Tor. It is indeed highly likely that the people of Leskernick were panning for local metals, had close contacts with distant chiefdoms, but, so far at least, our sense is of a limited vertical hierarchy. Environment and ecology. The magnitude and extent of climatic deterioration at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age has been the subject of debate for several decades, with evidence provided from palynology, ice-sheet dynamics, estimations of solar activity, and especially data from ombrogenous bogs (peat-forming mires above groundwater level). According to the chronology presented by Tony Brown in a 2008 review of the British Bronze Age, the so-called 4.2-kiloyear event (c. 2250 BCE) brought cooler, wetter conditions throughout Britain, resulting in a period of decreased average temperatures between the Holocene maximum and the Medieval Warm Period from c. 2050 BCE to 550 BCE. According to Brown, bog surface wetness (BSW, a proxy for past climatic conditions) was stable or slightly reduced from c. 2000 BCE to c. 1800–1500 BCE, after which there was an increase in BSW (i.e. a rise in bog-water tables, and hence a wetter climate) which lasted 200 to 300 years, ending c. 1200 BCE, after which there was a drier period lasting until c. 800–750 BCE, when there was a rise in bog-water tables across the whole of Europe.The gradual abandonment of upland settlements on Bodmin Moor c. 1000 BCE has been attributed to climatic degradation, resulting in soil deterioration, expanding areas of peat, and poor harvests. A 2016 study found a relationship between a peak in wetness c. 1000 BCE and a cessation of human activity in upland areas in south-west Britain, suggesting that upland farming communities may have been vulnerable to climate changes and adapted by moving to the lowlands. Others have argued that in some areas, including Bodmin Moor, there is no evidence for climate and soil deterioration, and other factors may have encouraged a general migration to lowland zones. Gearey et al. state that their 1999 pollen analysis of Bodmin Moor did not support the theory that uplands were abandoned due to deterioration of grazing pasture. Andy Jones has argued that the hypothesis of widespread abandonment as a result of climatic deterioration of upland areas of the south-west region c. 1000 BCE is unlikely to be correct, and proposes that instead, a more complex pattern of land use or ownership developed after this time in upland zones. Peter Herring has argued that, rather than individual farmers abandoning upland zones as a response to environmental changes, there was instead a collective decision to reorganize upland grazing zones, in response to human population growth and increasing herd sizes on the uplands. Gearey et al. state that \"the search for any one factor to explain the end of extensive Bronze Age settlement is over-simplistic\", and instead argue that \"an interplay of socio-economic and environmental factors may be responsible for the shift in emphasis from upland to lowland\". They highlight Brisbane and Clewes\\' conclusion that the apparent relationship between increased areas of wet acidic grassland and the abandonment of coaxial field systems in the East Moor may be merely coincidental, rather than causal.Analysis of pollen samples shows that moderately dense mixed oak-hazel woodland dominated prehistoric South West Britain. Over the course of the Bronze Age these woodlands were substantially cleared, creating large areas of open grassland and scrub. Evidence for woodland clearance is found at several sites. On Bodmin Moor, pollen core evidence is found at Rough Tor South, c. 1670–1430 BCE, where mixed oak, hazel, and birch woodland declines, with expansion of grass, ribwort plantain, and common heather. At Tresellern Marsh, c. 1130–940 BCE, pollen cores indicate the rapid disappearance of alder woodland before 1260–900 BCE. At Stannon Down, woodland clearance began in the Neolithic, although there is still a significant area of woodland here at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Clearance accelerated throughout this period, and settlement activity and the creation of enclosures resulted in substantial reduction in woodland coverage. By the Middle Bronze Age large areas of land at Stannon had been transformed into open grassland with diverse vegetation, with trees mainly restricted to the valleys. Some wooded areas may have been retained in order to provide a symbolic setting for the cairns here. At Higher Moors, St Mary\\'s, Scilly, woodland clearance may have occurred during the mid to late Bronze Age, followed by a regeneration of birch woodland. Woodland regeneration is not found at other sites on Scilly, and so the evidence from Higher Moors may not indicate woodland regeneration on Scilly as a whole.Evidence for managed woodland and meadows is found at some sites. At Lower Boscaswell, analysis of charcoal remains may indicate that woodland management was practised in the Early Bronze Age, and mixed oak-hazel woodland was probably managed at Tremough..  Evidence that wood was quickly grown at Scarcewater also implies that woodland was managed here, probably to provide the large amounts of timber required for roundhouse building and avoid conflict with neighbouring communities. The diverse species of Bronze Age grassland vegetation at Roughtor suggests hay meadow management and seasonal grazing activity. Ethnicity, genetics, and language. There is no evidence that the current boundaries of Cornwall had any meaning for the people who inhabited this region in the Bronze Age, and it is probable that the Bronze Age inhabitants of what is now Cornwall had complex identities based around family, honour ties, and their local geography and community. For instance, Andy Jones argues that the characteristic style of hollow-set roundhouses in the lowlands may indicate the existence of a distinctive lowland regional identity. Gary Robinson proposes that Early Bronze Age seafaring activity in Scilly would have created a sense of mutual trust and community, contributing to the creation of a \"common island identity\". Peter Herring suggests that the group of Bronze Age monuments in Penwith including The Pipers and The Merry Maidens may have been constructed by a newly arrived group of people in West Penwith, who were perhaps seeking to legitimize themselves by adapting earlier monuments.Recent archaeogenetics studies have detected two major migration waves into Britain during this period. The first, beginning c. 2450 BCE, corresponds to the arrival of a population associated with the Bell Beaker culture and carrying substantial levels of Yamnaya-related (\\'Steppe\\') ancestry,  which resulted in a minimum of 90% local population turnover by c. 1500–1000 BCE. This also resulted in the replacement of around 90% of the Y-chromosomes with subclades of the previously absent haplogroup R1b, and it introduced a range of mtDNA haplogroups that were not found in Britain before. The spread of Beaker culture is variously associated with certain stages of Indo-European languages by some linguists and archaeologists, including Old European (Alteuropäisch), pre-Celtic, and Proto-Celtic. There is no consensus on what language the people of the Beaker culture spoke. The second, a migration into Britain from sources that best fit populations from France, resulted in a substantial increase in Early European Farmer ancestry in Britain between c. 1000 and c. 875 BCE, which a 2022 study has suggested may represent a plausible vector for the introduction of early Celtic languages into Britain.DNA analysis has been performed on the remains of two Cornish Bronze Age humans. At the Harlyn Bay site, an Early Bronze Age cist, the skeleton of a young female directly dated to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age period c. 2285–2036 BCE was assigned mtDNA haplogroup R1b. Using a three-way model of ancestral components, this individual could be modelled as 11.1% Western European Hunter-Gatherer (WHG), 29.5% Early European Farmer (EEF), and 59.4% Steppe ancestry. The Bronze Age barrow on Constantine Island contained an ancient individual directly dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1381–1056 BCE). The individual was found to be male, with Y-DNA haplogroup R-BY27831 (R1b1a1b1a1a2a), a subclade of R-DF27, and mtDNA haplogroup U5b2b2. Using a three-way model, this individual could be modelled as 11.5% WHG, 34.3% EEF, and 54.1% Steppe ancestry.
