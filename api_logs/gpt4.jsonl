An urban center committed to fostering innovation, design, technology, and environmental sustainability. \\Predicted Answer: 1. Medieval urban center: Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. 2. Early Modern urban center: Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. 3. Industrial urban center: Barcelona underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and the establishment of the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I. 4. Expansion urban center: In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. 5. Modern urban center: The construction of two large skyscrapers (Hotel Arts and Torre Mapfre) changed the physiognomy of Barcelona.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Increase in retirement age: The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is seen as a threat to the cherished right to retirement, particularly for blue-collar workers. 2. Perceived unfairness: Critics argue that Macron has refused to consider alternative ways to balance the pension system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation, or raising taxes on wealthy households or companies. 3. Pre-existing anger against Macron: Macron has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich,' which has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms. 4. Lack of clear calculations: Opponents contest the need for urgency and argue that the official body monitoring France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits are hard to accurately predict. 5. Comparison to Sarkozy's reform: Macron's proposal has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. 6. Acceleration of previous changes: Macron has accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension rules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation. 7. Disdain for workers: Macron's perceived disdain for workers has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms, with critics arguing that he has insulted French people in general. 8. Lack of democratic legitimacy: The government's decision to bypass a parliamentary vote and use a special constitutional power to push through the reforms has been criticized for undercutting the law's democratic legitimacy. 9. Failure to address concerns: Despite widespread protests and opposition, Macron has emphasized that the pension reforms will go forward, which has further fueled anger and dissatisfaction. 10. Economic concerns: Macron's reforms have been criticized for not doing enough to address the rising cost of living and the lack of well-paying jobs, which has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 549, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00552}

Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. When asked how Virginia would respond if the United States Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell v.

An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office.

{"prompt": "\\Question: What might be the reasons why Macron's pension reform is substantially unpopular? \\Answer: 1.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Pre-existing anger against Macron, who has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'. 2. The reforms taking place during a cost-of-living crisis, which has worsened anger and protests over the policies. 3. Criticism that the reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, as they usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower. 4. The reforms disproportionately affecting the working-class and those who work in manual jobs, who are likely to start working at a younger age. 5. Opponents arguing that the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers, and disputing the need for urgency. 6. The perception that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation, or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies. 7. The official body that monitors France's pension system acknowledging that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits are hard to accurately predict. 8. The reforms leading to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. 9. The reforms being seen as a 'non-starter' by unions, who view the increase in the retirement age as unacceptable. 10. The government's concessions, such as allowing some workers in physically or mentally demanding jobs to retire earlier with a full pension, failing to mollify opposition. 11. The perception that Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy. 12. The reforms being seen as prioritizing the interests of businesses and the wealthy over those of average workers. 13.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to women retiring later and working longer over the course of their life. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: The reforms are perceived to disproportionately affect blue-collar workers and those who work in manual jobs, who often start working at a younger age. 3. Prioritization of businesses and the wealthy: Critics argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and high-income individuals over average laborers, and that Macron has refused to consider alternative ways to balance the system, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy. 4.

{"prompt": "\\Question: Please describe the significant events related to prostitution. \\Answer: In the 19th century 1840s, the 'Despotov Han' inn was considered the first brothel with a record in Belgrade. In the mid-1950s, bars became places of prostitution. After World War II, the basement of the 'Split' cafe was used for prostitution. In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. The first recorded brothel in Belgrade was \"Despotov Han\" inn, the predecessor of \"Gr\u010dka Kraljica,\" dating from the 1840s. 2. The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the \u010cika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building, and was demolished in the early 1990s. 3. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903. 4. Street prostitution developed since the late 1960s, with sex workers operating on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and becoming known as \"stoperke\" (\"hitchhiker girls\"). 5. The Economy Faculty's Park was another long-surviving location for prostitution, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned the moniker \"Picin park\" [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed \"kamenjarke\" (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. 6. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. 7. Another location synonymous with prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medakovi\u0107. 8. Old-style brothels continued, followed in the 1990s by porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. 9. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets,\" though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 521, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00524}

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to women retiring later and working longer over the course of their lives. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: Blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age and are disproportionately affected by the reforms, with some arguing that the government is prioritizing businesses and highly paid individuals over average laborers. 3. Perceived lack of urgency: Opponents dispute the need for urgency and argue that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits, refusing to consider alternative ways to balance the system. 4. Macron's personal image: The unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron himself, as he has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \"president of the rich.\" 5.

The market operates under quarantine conditions and animals from scheduled countries must be landed at this market and nowhere else. The market is surrounded by a high boundary wall and trading is by private bargain in live animals only. The market is not an auction market and salesmen and buyers intermingle around the animal pens. Market days are Mondays and Thursdays, but animals can be sold in their lairs on other days. Weighbridges are seldom used and cattle weights are guesstimated. The buyers are wholesale and retail butchers who have access to slaughterhouse space on the premises and slaughtermen, paid by results, kill and butcher their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law. The buyers take away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces and most of the meat is resold at Smithfield. The volume of trade fluctuates considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more foreign cattle were sent to Deptford than British to Islington. The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897) and of sheep, 783,440 (1882). Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford.

The market operated under quarantine conditions and animals from scheduled countries, which were not banned outright, must be landed at this market and nowhere else. The rule was strictly enforced and employment conditions in the market were precarious due to the changing animal disease regulations. The volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations and unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. The market had about 110 direct employees and 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious. There was much insobriety among the workers due to the high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men.

He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has taken a mixed approach to environmental pollution and impact. On one hand, he issued an executive order that rescinded a ban on single-use plastics at state agencies and was criticized by environmental groups for not taking stronger measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic.

He expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month but did not invite any openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to a private Pride reception at the Capitol, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and other LGBTQ+ groups. Youngkin's administration announced plans to repeal all protections for transgender students introduced under Northam.

{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has taken a controversial approach to environmental issues, signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality. He has voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay and proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. However, he opposed the scope of a bill designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness and attempted to \"gut\" it through amendments. Youngkin has also expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change, stating that he does not know what causes it and considers the cause irrelevant. He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls. Additionally, Youngkin has attempted to block a law set to take effect in 2024 that would require Virginia to follow California's vehicle emissions standards and issued an executive order that rescinded a ban on single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. He has called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River and supports an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, including both renewable energy sources and natural gas. Youngkin has also proposed that Virginia become a world leader in nuclear energy and called for a small modular reactor to be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. After winning the election, Youngkin announced his desire to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market, and signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. Despite likely legal challenges, the Youngkin administration announced in August 2022 that it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. However, Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which is used for flood control and to provide low-income ratepayers with energy assistance.

He planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms using the elongated site at the top of the hill. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him. The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms. In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop. Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 503, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00506}

{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has taken several actions related to environmental pollution and impact. In April 2022, he issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies, which was criticized by environmental groups. He also signed legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality. Youngkin has expressed a desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024 that would require Virginia to follow California's vehicle emissions standards. He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. However, Youngkin has also opposed the scope of a bill designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness and attempted to \"gut\" it by amending it, but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate. Additionally, he has called for Virginia to withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market, and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. However, Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which is used for flood control and to provide low-income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 549, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00552}

At Low Tides The Water Depth Was At Least 12 Feet (3.7 M) opening: The Market Was Opened For Business In January 1872. \\Predicted Answer: The Foreign Cattle Market was located at Deptford, on the south bank of the River Thames in London. It was designed by Sir Horace Jones, who took a minimalist approach due to time constraints. The site was not cleared, and existing dockyard buildings were adapted as necessary. The market had a river frontage of 1,012 feet and comprised 22 acres, later increased to 30 acres. It had three large, immensely strong timber piers for disembarking cattle, which could receive up to three cattle boats at once. The piers had platforms at two levels to allow animals to be discharged regardless of the state of the tide. The market could accommodate 8,500 cattle and 20,000 sheep, and had 70 slaughterhouses. The defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen for the market, and some features dating to Henry VIII were preserved.

{"prompt": "\\Question: How did Youngkin deal with LGBTQ+ rights and policy issues in Virginia? \\Answer: He legally supports the LGBT community, but he personally cannot accept it. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has maintained the governor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Board but has been criticized for lack of meaningful support for the LGBTQ+ community. He hosted a private Pride reception at the Capitol but did not invite any of Virginia's openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. He rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. He has been critical of protections for transgender students and has announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam. His first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order \"targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students.\" This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\". A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False.", "n_input_tokens": 508, "n_output_tokens": 2, "cost": 0.0051400000000000005}

{"prompt": "\\Question: Please describe the significant events related to prostitution. \\Answer: In the 19th century 1840s, the 'Despotov Han' inn was considered the first brothel with a record in Belgrade. In the mid-1950s, bars became places of prostitution. After World War II, the basement of the 'Split' cafe was used for prostitution. In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. The street prostitution developed since the late 1960s, with sex workers operating on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and becoming known as stoperke (\"hitchhiker girls\"). 2. A row of inns was built along the Pan\u010devo and Zrenjanin roads to accommodate the stoperke. 3. The Economy Faculty's Park became a long-surviving location for prostitution, including gay and transsexual prostitution, earning the moniker Picin park [Pussy Park]. 4.

Old-style brothels continued, followed by porn-shops and business escort agencies in the 1990s, some even located in Skadarlija. 7. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets\", though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution. 8. The steerage of the first kafana on the boat, \"Split\", was adapted into private rooms and used for prostitution, leading to frequent police raids. 9. In time, kafanas evolved into westernized restaurants, but many traditional ones survived and remained part of Belgrade's tourist offer. 10. The 1990s in Serbia were marked by calamities, with criminals beginning to occupy clubs and nightlife in general, leading to shootings and killings in disco clubs becoming regular events. 11. Disco clubs lost their top position in night fun, as young people turned to folkotheques (disco clubs with turbo-folk music) and splavovi, or barge-clubs. 12. Among the most popular barges were \"Lukas\", where singer Aca Lukas started his folk career, assuming the splav's name as his own alias, \"Mozzart\" (which sank after 2000), and \"Triton\". 13.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to later retirement and lower pensions. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: Blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age and face physically demanding jobs, making the increase in retirement age disproportionately challenging for them. 3.

Exaggerated threat of deficits: Opponents contest the need for urgency and argue that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits, refusing to consider alternative ways to balance the system. 5. Pre-existing anger against Macron: The unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, as he has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich.' 6.

Sant Mart\u00ed: Formerly industrial, now new technology firms. \\Predicted Answer: The functional zoning of each district in Barcelona is not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that various population centers were created around churches and monasteries, each with its own character such as port, agrarian, or suburban. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, and a network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city. The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10\u201312 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent \u2014later City Hall\u2014 or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital \u2014such as the Santa Creu\u2014 or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the B\u00f2ria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Pla\u00e7a Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False", "n_input_tokens": 649, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00652}

The motion would require the support of a majority of the members of the National Assembly to pass and trigger a government collapse, leading to either new elections or the formation of a new government.

Reforms Do Not Adequately Tackle The Disadvantage Women Are At Within The Workforce. 2. The Reforms Will Hit The Working-Class And Those Who Work In Manual Jobs Disproportionately. 3. It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to women retiring later and working longer over the course of their lives. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: Blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age and are disproportionately affected by the reforms, with some arguing that the government is prioritizing businesses and highly paid individuals over average laborers. 3. Perceived lack of urgency: Opponents dispute the need for urgency and argue that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits, refusing to consider other ways to balance the system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes or taxes on wealthy households or companies. 4. Macron's personal image: The unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron himself, as he has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \"president of the rich.\" 5. Cost-of-living crisis: The reforms are taking place during a cost-of-living crisis, which has worsened anger and protests over the policies. 6. Union opposition: All major unions are against the reforms, leading to widespread strikes and protests. 7. Violence and rioting: Instances of violence and rioting have occurred during demonstrations, further fueling anger and opposition to the reforms. 8. Looting and property damage: Unauthorized protests have led to looting and property damage, further escalating tensions. 9.

{"prompt": "\\Question: How did Youngkin deal with LGBTQ+ rights and policy issues in Virginia? \\Answer: He legally supports the LGBT community, but he personally cannot accept it. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has been critical of protections for transgender students in Virginia and has announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under his predecessor, Ralph Northam. He has also stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. As governor, he has signed an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory and has enlisted the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, to assist in revising Virginia's educational standards for history and social sciences. Additionally, he has advocated for a bill that would have reversed reforms that had been recently adopted to the admissions processes at some Governor's Schools in Virginia, specifically at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria and at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. The bill supported by Youngkin would have banned such an approach, characterizing the use of geographic and socioeconomic factors as \"proxy discrimination\". This bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but failed in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. A separate bill signed by Youngkin that same year bans Governor's Schools in Virginia \"from discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the process of admitting students to such school.\" This bill, which received bipartisan support, was described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as \"a watered-down version\" of Youngkin's preferred bill. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin \"has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law.\" During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates.

Youngkin has argued that these and other similar concepts are divisive and promote a negative view of American history, and he has called for a greater emphasis on teaching \"traditional\" American values and history in Virginia's public schools. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False.", "n_input_tokens": 246, "n_output_tokens": 2, "cost": 0.0025200000000000005}
{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has taken a mixed approach to dealing with environmental pollution and impact. On one hand, he has expressed support for protecting the James River and the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. On the other hand, he has opposed legislation aimed at improving Virginia's flood preparedness, rescinded an order banning single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies, and revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality. Additionally, Youngkin has expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change and has opposed Virginia's Clean Economy Act, which calls for the state's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050. He has also announced plans to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market, and to block a law set to take effect in 2024 that would require Virginia to follow California's vehicle emissions standards. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False", "n_input_tokens": 368, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00371}

Pointillism involves the application of small dots of pure color that blend in the viewer's eye to create a luminous effect. Divisionism is a similar technique that involves the separation of colors into individual dots or strokes. Optical mixing refers to the blending of colors in the viewer's eye rather than on the canvas.

{"prompt": "\\Question: Which work represents a cooperative work by Hubert and Jan van Eyck that demonstrates a perfect mix of lights in the celestial background? \\Answer: The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. \\Predicted Answer: The Ghent Altarpiece, also known as The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, is a cooperative work by Hubert and Jan van Eyck that demonstrates a perfect mix of lights in the celestial background. The work, completed in 1432, is a masterpiece of Early Netherlandish painting and is considered one of the greatest achievements of Western art. The altarpiece is a complex polyptych, with multiple panels that depict various religious scenes, including the adoration of the lamb by a multitude of angels and saints. The celestial background of the central panel is particularly noteworthy for its use of light, with a mix of warm and cool tones that create a sense of depth and space. The van Eyck brothers achieved this effect through their mastery of oil painting techniques, which allowed them to build up layers of translucent glazes to create a luminous, ethereal atmosphere.

This is a parliamentary procedure that allows the legislature to express its lack of confidence in the executive branch and potentially force a change in government. In this case, it is likely that Marine Le Pen would file a no-confidence motion in response to the pension reforms that were recently passed by the government, which have been met with widespread protests and opposition.

{"prompt": "\\Question: What might be the reasons why Macron's pension reform is substantially unpopular? \\Answer: 1. Reforms Do Not Adequately Tackle The Disadvantage Women Are At Within The Workforce. 2. The Reforms Will Hit The Working-Class And Those Who Work In Manual Jobs Disproportionately. 3. It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Increase in retirement age: The proposed increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65 is seen as a significant burden on workers, who would have to work longer before they can access their pensions. 2. Changes to special pension rules: The abolition of special pension rules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation is perceived as unfair, as these workers often have physically demanding jobs. 3. Perceived lack of consideration: The reforms have been under consideration for a long time, and initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019 were met with delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to frustration among the affected workers. 4. Economic concerns: The projected deficit in the pension system and the government's claim that the reforms would balance the deficit by 2030 have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the pension system. 5. Perceived lack of alternatives: Many people believe that there are alternative solutions to the pension crisis, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy or finding new financing sources, rather than increasing the retirement age. 6. Political considerations: Macron's pension reform was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, and his insistence on implementing the reforms despite widespread opposition has led to a decline in his popularity. 7. Impact on physically demanding jobs: The reforms would require some workers in physically demanding jobs to work until they are 67 to qualify for a full state pension, which is seen as unfair. 8. Lack of trust in the government: The use of Article 49.3 to force the bill through without a vote in the National Assembly has been criticized as undemocratic and has further eroded public trust in the government. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 485, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00488}

{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has a mixed approach to environmental pollution and impact. On one hand, he issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies, which was criticized by environmental groups. On the other hand, he signed legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality. Additionally, he proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels and voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay. However, he also attempted to \"gut\" a bill designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness and opposed the scope of another bill aimed at improving the state's flood readiness. Youngkin also announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards. He has also expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change and has stated that he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act, which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050. Instead, he supports an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, including both renewable energy sources and natural gas, and has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy. Youngkin has also announced plans to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market, and has called for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. However, it is unclear whether he has the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 493, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00496}

{"prompt": "\\Question: Please describe the significant events related to prostitution. \\Answer: In the 19th century 1840s, the 'Despotov Han' inn was considered the first brothel with a record in Belgrade. In the mid-1950s, bars became places of prostitution. After World War II, the basement of the 'Split' cafe was used for prostitution. In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. In the mid-1950s, \"Lotos Bar\" was opened in Zmaj Jovina Street, offering \"artistic program\" which included barely dressed female dancers, and it became instant sensation. As members of the new Communists political establishment became regular visitors, the bar slipped from not-so-hidden striptease club into the, also not-so-hidden prostitution locale. 2. The street prostitution developed since the late 1960s. The sex workers operated on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and became known as stoperke (\"hitchhiker girls\"). As a result, a row of inns was built along the Pan\u010devo and Zrenjanin roads. 3. Another long surviving location was the Economy Faculty's Park, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned a moniker Picin park [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed kamenjarke (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. 4. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. 5. Old style brothels also continued, followed in the 1990s by the porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. 6. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets\", though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution. 7. \"Despotov Han\" inn, predecessor of \"Gr\u010dka Kraljica\", holds the infamy as the first recorded brothel in Belgrade, dating from the 1840s. 8. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903. 9. The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the \u010cika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building.

{"prompt": "\\Question: What techniques of painting are mentioned in pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used? \\Answer: Four techniques are mentioned, including oil painting, pastel painting, watercolor, acrylic paint. \\Predicted Answer: The techniques of painting mentioned in the pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used are drawing in pencil or charcoal, oil painting, and Indian ink. In drawing, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality, where white is generally the color of the paper. Pencil is usually worked with line and hatching, or by means of blurred spots. Charcoal allows the use of gouache and chalk or white chalk to add touches of light, as well as sanguine or sepia. Indian ink generates very violent chiaroscuro, without intermediate values, making it a very expressive medium. Oil painting is the one that best allows to value the light effects and the chromatic tones. Giotto was the first painter to represent sunlight, a type of soft, transparent illumination, but one that already served to model figures and enhance the quality of clothes and objects. In the Netherlands, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin sought to capture various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen, imitating the reflections of light on mirrors and metallic surfaces and highlighting the brilliance of colored jewels and gems. Impressionism perfected the capture of light by means of fragmented touches of color, a procedure that had already been used to a greater or lesser extent by artists such as Giorgione, Titian, Guardi and Vel\u00e1zquez. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False", "n_input_tokens": 350, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00353}

{"prompt": "\\Question: What techniques of painting are mentioned in pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used? \\Answer: Four techniques are mentioned, including oil painting, pastel painting, watercolor, acrylic paint. \\Predicted Answer: The techniques of painting mentioned in the pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used are: 1. Oil painting: In this technique, light is represented by means of contrast, executed in oil. 2. Acrylic painting: In this technique, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents. 3. Pointillism: In this technique, there is no precise source of illumination, but each point is a light source in itself. The composition is based on juxtaposed (\"divided\") dots of a pure color, which merge in the eye of the viewer at a given distance. 4. Glazing: The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke. 5. Chiaroscuro: The interrelation between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\"; if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\". 6.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women and working-class: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantages women face in the workforce, leading to later retirement and lower pensions. Additionally, blue-collar workers and those in manual jobs are disproportionately affected, as they often start working at a younger age. 2. Perceived prioritization of businesses and the wealthy: Critics argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and high-income individuals over average laborers, with some disputing the need for urgency in implementing the reforms. 3. Alternative solutions not considered: Opponents believe that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and has refused to consider other ways to balance the system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation, or raising taxes on wealthy households or companies. 4. Pre-existing anger against Macron: The unpopularity of the reforms can also be partially attributed to Macron personally, as he has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \"president of the rich.\" 5.

Weighbridges are seldom used and cattle weights are guesstimated. The buyers are wholesale and sometimes retail butchers who have access to slaughterhouse space on the premises and the slaughtermen are paid by results. The buyers take away the meat, offal, hides, and fleeces and most of the meat is resold at Smithfield.

{"prompt": "\\Question: How did Youngkin deal with LGBTQ+ rights and policy issues in Virginia? \\Answer: He legally supports the LGBT community, but he personally cannot accept it. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has been critical of protections for transgender students in Virginia and has announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under his predecessor, Ralph Northam. He has also supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory, which also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The order also cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. In early April 2022, Youngkin signed a bill allowing school parents throughout Virginia to review and opt their children out of any educational material containing \"sexually explicit content\"; any opted out student would be provided with alternative material. This is the first statewide law in the nation allowing for parental review of sexually explicit content in school curriculum. Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\". The bill passed along mostly party lines. A similar bill, known as the \"Beloved Bill\", was vetoed by McAuliffe in both 2016 and 2017. That bill, which had originated when a conservative activist took issue with the inclusion of Beloved in her high school senior son's AP English class, became one of the focal points of Virginia's 2021 gubernatorial election, and reviving the bill was identified by The Washington Post as \"one of the key promises\" of Youngkin's campaign. The provisions of the bill will take effect in 2023. In May 2022, Youngkin sent a letter to the Council of Presidents overseeing Virginia colleges and universities, urging mandatory political diversity in their hiring practices.

Perceived unfairness: Critics argue that the reforms disproportionately affect women, working-class individuals, and those in manual jobs, while not adequately addressing the disadvantages these groups face in the workforce. 2. Pre-existing anger against Macron: Macron has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \"president of the rich,\" which has heightened opposition to the reforms. 3. Timing during a cost-of-living crisis: The reforms are taking place during a time of high inflation, which has worsened public anger and led to protests. 4. Concerns about long-term deficits: Opponents dispute the need for urgency and argue that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits, refusing to consider alternative ways to balance the system. 5. Lack of immediate threat: The official body monitoring France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy, making the reforms seem less necessary. 6. Perceived prioritization of businesses and the wealthy: Critics argue that the government is prioritizing the interests of businesses and high-income individuals over average laborers. 7. Concessions viewed as insufficient: The government's concessions, such as allowing some blue-collar workers to retire earlier, have failed to mollify opposition, as unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter.\" 8.

In June 2022, Youngkin expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month but did not invite any of Virginia's openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia. In July 2022, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if the US Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can't live in the world of hypotheticals.\" The Virginia Constitution includes an amendment banning same-sex marriage, which would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself. An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office. Youngkin has also been critical of protections for transgender students in Virginia public schools and has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam. Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory, which also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The executive order also cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "False", "n_input_tokens": 450, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00453}

{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has taken several actions related to environmental pollution and impact. He issued an executive order that rescinded a ban on single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies, which was criticized by environmental groups. He also signed legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority from citizen review boards to the Department of Environmental Quality. This change was opposed by environmental groups but gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature. Additionally, Youngkin has called for better protection against pollution of the James River and voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay. He proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels but opposed the scope of a bill designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness.

In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. The first recorded brothel in Belgrade was \"Despotov Han\" inn, the predecessor of \"Gr\u010dka Kraljica,\" dating from the 1840s. 2. The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the \u010cika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building, and was demolished in the early 1990s. 3. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903. 4. Street prostitution developed since the late 1960s, with sex workers operating on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and becoming known as \"stoperke\" (\"hitchhiker girls\"). 5. The Economy Faculty's Park was another long-surviving location for prostitution, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned the moniker \"Picin park\" [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed \"kamenjarke\" (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. 6. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. 7. Another location synonymous with prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medakovi\u0107. 8. Old-style brothels continued, followed in the 1990s by porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. 9. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets,\" though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution. 10.

{"prompt": "\\Question: How does Youngkin deal with environmental pollution and environmental impact? \\Answer: Youngkin is uncertain about the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the causes of climate change don't matter. He supports climate change adaptation measures, such as the construction of additional seawalls. While he supports renewable energy and natural gas, he has refused to sign Virginia's Clean Economy Act, saying it would increase utility prices. He advocated for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy and proposed building a small modular reactor in Southwest Virginia within the next decade. He signed an executive order to reassess Virginia's participation in regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. \\Predicted Answer: Youngkin has a mixed record on dealing with environmental pollution and impact. On one hand, he has taken some actions to address pollution, such as calling for better protection of the James River and supporting ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay. He also proposed the establishment of a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. However, he has also taken actions that have been criticized by environmental groups, such as issuing an executive order that rescinded a ban on single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies and attempting to \"gut\" a bill designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. Additionally, he has expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change and has stated that he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act, which calls for the state's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050. He has also attempted to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market, and has revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 385, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00388}

In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. The first recorded brothel in Belgrade, \"Despotov Han\" inn, dates back to the 1840s. 2.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Pre-existing anger against Macron: As a historian on France's political culture theorized, the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him. 2. Image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich': Macron has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich', which has further fueled opposition to the reforms. 3. Tying himself to the project: By tying himself to the project, opposition to it is heightened and dramatized in a way, leading to a large part of public opinion being against him. 4. Impact on physically demanding jobs: The reforms would raise the retirement age to 64 or 65, from 62, which could disproportionately affect those in physically demanding jobs. 5. Perception of undemocratic process: The government's decision to force the bill through without a parliamentary vote has been criticized as undemocratic, further fueling opposition to the reforms. 6. Economic concerns: The reforms are seen as an attempt to keep the pension system solvent and government borrowing acceptably low, but many are concerned about the potential economic impact on individuals and families. 7. Comparison to Sarkozy's reform: Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. 8. Lack of clear calculations: The lack of clear calculations in the plan has been criticized, leading to concerns about its effectiveness and fairness. 9. Political ramifications: The reforms have caused unease within the parties that Macron is aligned with or close to, and have been seen as a threat to his authority, further fueling opposition. 10. Alternatives: Many have suggested alternatives to the reforms, such as using a referendum or firing the Prime Minister, which could reset Macron's image and address public concerns. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 549, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00552}

{"prompt": "\\Question: What techniques of painting are mentioned in pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used? \\Answer: Four techniques are mentioned, including oil painting, pastel painting, watercolor, acrylic paint. \\Predicted Answer: The techniques of painting mentioned in the pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used are: 1. Oil painting: In this technique, light is represented by means of contrast, executed in oil. 2. Acrylic painting: In this technique, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents. 3. Pointillism: In this technique, there is no precise source of illumination, but each point is a light source in itself. The composition is based on juxtaposed (\"divided\") dots of a pure color, which merge in the eye of the viewer at a given distance. 4. Glazing: The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke. 5. Chiaroscuro: The interrelation between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\"; if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\". 6. Colorism: The \"coloristic\" light can be by chiaroscuro (light and shadow) or by surface (a point of light that shines brighter than the rest); and the \"chromatic\", which can be tonal (contrast between two tones) or by saturation (a bright color with a neutral one). 7. Luminism: In this technique, light is diffused from the background of the painting and, as it expands, it is enough by itself to create a sensation of depth, blurring the contours and degrading the colors to create the space of the painting. 8. Impressionism: In this technique, artists painted from life, capturing at all times the variations of light on landscapes and objects, the fleeting \"impression\" of light at different times of the day. 9. Fauvism: In this movement, a new conception of pictorial illumination arose, which consisted in the negation of shadows; the light comes from the colors themselves, which acquire an intense and radiant luminosity. 10.
