An urban center committed to fostering innovation, design, technology, and environmental sustainability. \\Predicted Answer: 1. Medieval urban center: Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. 2. Early Modern urban center: Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. 3. Industrial urban center: Barcelona underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and the establishment of the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I. 4. Expansion urban center: In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. 5. Modern urban center: The construction of two large skyscrapers (Hotel Arts and Torre Mapfre) changed the physiognomy of Barcelona.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Increase in retirement age: The proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 is seen as a threat to the cherished right to retirement, particularly for blue-collar workers. 2. Perceived unfairness: Critics argue that Macron has refused to consider alternative ways to balance the pension system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation, or raising taxes on wealthy households or companies. 3. Pre-existing anger against Macron: Macron has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich,' which has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms. 4. Lack of clear calculations: Opponents contest the need for urgency and argue that the official body monitoring France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits are hard to accurately predict. 5. Comparison to Sarkozy's reform: Macron's proposal has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. 6. Acceleration of previous changes: Macron has accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension rules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation. 7. Disdain for workers: Macron's perceived disdain for workers has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms, with critics arguing that he has insulted French people in general. 8. Lack of democratic legitimacy: The government's decision to bypass a parliamentary vote and use a special constitutional power to push through the reforms has been criticized for undercutting the law's democratic legitimacy. 9. Failure to address concerns: Despite widespread protests and opposition, Macron has emphasized that the pension reforms will go forward, which has further fueled anger and dissatisfaction. 10. Economic concerns: Macron's reforms have been criticized for not doing enough to address the rising cost of living and the lack of well-paying jobs, which has contributed to the unpopularity of the reforms. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 549, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00552}

Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. When asked how Virginia would respond if the United States Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell v.

An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office.

{"prompt": "\\Question: What might be the reasons why Macron's pension reform is substantially unpopular? \\Answer: 1.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Pre-existing anger against Macron, who has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'. 2. The reforms taking place during a cost-of-living crisis, which has worsened anger and protests over the policies. 3. Criticism that the reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, as they usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower. 4. The reforms disproportionately affecting the working-class and those who work in manual jobs, who are likely to start working at a younger age. 5. Opponents arguing that the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers, and disputing the need for urgency. 6. The perception that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, such as increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation, or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies. 7. The official body that monitors France's pension system acknowledging that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits are hard to accurately predict. 8. The reforms leading to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. 9. The reforms being seen as a 'non-starter' by unions, who view the increase in the retirement age as unacceptable. 10. The government's concessions, such as allowing some workers in physically or mentally demanding jobs to retire earlier with a full pension, failing to mollify opposition. 11. The perception that Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy. 12. The reforms being seen as prioritizing the interests of businesses and the wealthy over those of average workers. 13.

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to women retiring later and working longer over the course of their life. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: The reforms are perceived to disproportionately affect blue-collar workers and those who work in manual jobs, who often start working at a younger age. 3. Prioritization of businesses and the wealthy: Critics argue that the government is prioritizing businesses and high-income individuals over average laborers, and that Macron has refused to consider alternative ways to balance the system, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy. 4.

{"prompt": "\\Question: Please describe the significant events related to prostitution. \\Answer: In the 19th century 1840s, the 'Despotov Han' inn was considered the first brothel with a record in Belgrade. In the mid-1950s, bars became places of prostitution. After World War II, the basement of the 'Split' cafe was used for prostitution. In the late 1960s, street prostitutes rapidly developed, and sex workers were called 'hitchhiking girls'. Since 2010, elite prostitutes have been referred to as 'star girls'. Prostitution has been mainly suppressed by the actions of the Serbian Sisters Circle, which was founded in 1903. \\Predicted Answer: 1. The first recorded brothel in Belgrade was \"Despotov Han\" inn, the predecessor of \"Gr\u010dka Kraljica,\" dating from the 1840s. 2. The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the \u010cika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building, and was demolished in the early 1990s. 3. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903. 4. Street prostitution developed since the late 1960s, with sex workers operating on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and becoming known as \"stoperke\" (\"hitchhiker girls\"). 5. The Economy Faculty's Park was another long-surviving location for prostitution, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned the moniker \"Picin park\" [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed \"kamenjarke\" (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. 6. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. 7. Another location synonymous with prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medakovi\u0107. 8. Old-style brothels continued, followed in the 1990s by porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. 9. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets,\" though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution. \\given the question and the ground truth answer, is the predicted answer correct? \\True or False?: ", "completion": "True", "n_input_tokens": 521, "n_output_tokens": 1, "cost": 0.00524}

It is argued that The Government Is Prioritizing Businesses And People Who Are Highly Paid Over Average Laborers. \\Predicted Answer: The unpopularity of Macron's pension reform can be attributed to several factors: 1. Disproportionate impact on women: The reforms do not adequately address the disadvantage women face within the workforce, leading to women retiring later and working longer over the course of their lives. 2. Impact on working-class and manual laborers: Blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age and are disproportionately affected by the reforms, with some arguing that the government is prioritizing businesses and highly paid individuals over average laborers. 3. Perceived lack of urgency: Opponents dispute the need for urgency and argue that Macron has exaggerated the threat of projected deficits, refusing to consider alternative ways to balance the system. 4. Macron's personal image: The unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron himself, as he has struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch \"president of the rich.\" 5.

The market operates under quarantine conditions and animals from scheduled countries must be landed at this market and nowhere else. The market is surrounded by a high boundary wall and trading is by private bargain in live animals only. The market is not an auction market and salesmen and buyers intermingle around the animal pens. Market days are Mondays and Thursdays, but animals can be sold in their lairs on other days. Weighbridges are seldom used and cattle weights are guesstimated. The buyers are wholesale and retail butchers who have access to slaughterhouse space on the premises and slaughtermen, paid by results, kill and butcher their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law. The buyers take away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces and most of the meat is resold at Smithfield. The volume of trade fluctuates considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more foreign cattle were sent to Deptford than British to Islington. The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897) and of sheep, 783,440 (1882). Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford.
