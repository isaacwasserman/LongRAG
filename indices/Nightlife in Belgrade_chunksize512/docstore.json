Origins. Predecessors of modern nightlife were the kafanas, oriental style bistros. The very first one in Belgrade was opened during the Ottoman period, in 1522, in Dor\u0107ol. Believed to be the oldest such venue in Europe, it served only Turkish coffee. This was only a year after the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade, and 33 years before the first kafana was opened in Istanbul in 1555. There are no historical sources to why Belgrade was so important at the time to have such venue so early. Ottoman traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi visited Belgrade in 1661 and counted 21 khans and 6 caravanserais. The largest, Caravanserai of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had \"160 chimneys\", and some had harem sections. When Austrians conquered Belgrade in 1718, among other reports to the imperial court in Vienna, they sent a report on kafanas naming them: \"Crni orao\", \"Crveni petao\", \"Pet \u0161eva\", \"Tri zeca\", \"Divlji \u010dovek\", etc. They especially addressed the problematic \"Kod dve bule\", notorious favorite place of the \"debauched\" Baron Franz von der Trenck.Belgrade remained rich in kafanas in this period as there were almost 200 kafanas and meyhanas, so production of alcoholic beverages in the city bloomed to meet the demand. Austrian governor, Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, was known for his love of the night life. He abolished all taxes on drink serving, and business blossomed. There were some 140 kafanas and pubs in the German section of the city, and over 200 in the Serbian sector. The former mostly served beer, and the latter wine and rakia. In the 1717-1723 period, four breweries were opened in Belgrade. Duke also organized balls in his palace. In the periods when the balls were organized, music in other parts of the city was forbidden.

The aristocracy mostly used the commoners as a laughingstock at the balls, and those who refused to come or made problems at the balls, were jailed and whipped. A massive, lush dinners and feasts, known as traktacije, were organized. They included meals out of reach for the common people, like caviar, octopuses, salted herrings, fried pigeons, hot chocolate or imported wines. After the return of the Ottomans in 1739, this \"baroque blitz\" of Belgrade's nightlife ended.After the recapturing, at the corner of the modern Kralja Petra and Cara Du\u0161ana streets, kafana \"Crni orao\", the first such facility with the recorded word kafana in its name, survived. It served coffee and nargile. The object was also important for other reasons. It was also the first brewery in Belgrade, and the first venue to work 24/7. On the floor above dwelled guardsmen, the crew of the fortress' Timi\u0219oara Gate. As their duty was 24/7, so were the kafana's working hours. The building survived until the Interbellum.White Bear Tavern was opened in the 18th century in the town of Zemun. The building was constructed in the first half of the 17th century and served as caravanserai (khan) at least since 1658. Popular venue stayed in business until the early 1960s.

However, Zemun developed independently from Belgrade and for the most part during history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the House at 10 Cara Du\u0161ana Street in Dor\u0107ol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.The word kafana, introduced by the Ottomans (qahve hane), was derived from the Persian qahvah\u2013khanah, meaning \"coffee house\". English version appeared for the first time in 1615, published by George Sandys after his travels to Constantinople. Golden age. Prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 codified hospitality objects in 1847, dividing them into mehanas and khans, with former given the rank of craft shops. For a long time venues remained unchanged: clothless tables, loosen chairs and benches, tinplate furnaces fired by the guests themselves, tallow candles or petroleum lamps light. A culture of spending hours in kafanas developed among the lower classes. They discussed daily events, politics, shared funny stories or sang with gusle. But development of westernized venues began, built after the examples in Vienna or Budapest. They became gathering spots for officers, clerks, landowners, and, unlike traditional kafanas, occasionally they had women guests. Princess Ljubica Obrenovi\u0107 was a regular visitor of the fancy \"Manojlova ba\u0161ta\", in modern Zeleni Venac, where she was having a beer.

As Belgrade had no street lights at the time, the mayor Nikola Hristi\u0107 ordered that every person walking at night must have individual, personal lamp, stipulating high fines. As people coming from the venues at late hours were already breaking the law, they had no lamps, trying to stay unnoticed by the gendarmes. A subculture of bribery developed as for the offenders, when caught, it was less expensive to pay the gendarme than to pay the fine, while the gendarmes were poorly paid anyway.Kafanas became centers of city's social life, as the entire political and cultural pulse of the city radiated from them. Some historians described them as the \"most important institutions\" from the 19th century to World War II. Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 also codified them in 1863, and ordered that women were not allowed to own the kafana nor to work in the village and road ones, but one, or exceptionally two, could work in city kafanas. The venues diversified into various types: mehana, bistro, gostionica, han, saraj, lokal, kr\u010dma, bircuz, birtija and later also restoran, hotel, etc. Though all of them offered drinks, some were also offering food, rest and sleepover. Also, many had music. At the end of the 19th century, downtown Makedonska Street had 40 houses, of which 22 were kafanas. Kafanas were generally diversified: some served only coffee, other served only beer or offered only bean soup. Another codification, this time by the municipality, followed in 1877. Kafanas were categorized - kafanas of the first order were allowed to have one female waitress.As hubs of the social life, kafanas soon diversified: \"Esnafska kafana\" (for craftsmen - bricklayers, masons, well diggers, carpenters, sawyers), \"Makedonija\" (farmers and traders), \"Kod Albanije\" (leaseholders), etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_4": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Kafanas were categorized - kafanas of the first order were allowed to have one female waitress.As hubs of the social life, kafanas soon diversified: \"Esnafska kafana\" (for craftsmen - bricklayers, masons, well diggers, carpenters, sawyers), \"Makedonija\" (farmers and traders), \"Kod Albanije\" (leaseholders), etc. Depending on the political affiliation of the guests, some kafanas turned into the debate clubs of the Serbian Progressive Party, People's Radical Party or Liberal Party. \"Raji\u0107\" was the first kafana where modern \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i were prepared c.1860. Staple of the Serbian cuisine today, they were so popular that at one moment there were 300 \u0107evabd\u017einicas (\u0107evap\u010di\u0107i grill shops) in Belgrade.

The first hotel, \"Kod jelena\", was built in 1843 but became known as \"Staro zdanje\". It introduced European tradition in entertainment and had the first ballroom in Belgrade. The first ball in Belgrade was held in 1838. They became more frequent after 1860 and had a strict timetable and etiquette. Opposed to this, the vogue of so-called \"potato balls\" spread among the lower classes, especially in the suburban kafanas. They were named that way as, opposed to the distinguished dances of the rich, at these dance party surrogates people were just jumping and jerking, as if they were kicking potato sacks.The first kafana which allowed guests to stay the entire night \"?\", since the mid-19th century, originally only twice a year, after the Christmas and Easter liturgies.

The venues began to develop after 1867 and full withdrawal of the Ottomans from the city. The group included the \"Nacional\" inn, later also a hotel, built in 1868. \"Srpska kruna\" architecturally preserved the appearance of the khan - squared, central inner yard - but in modern style. It had only 12 rooms but was famous for its large ceremonial hall, used for the European-style balls and concerts, though every ball had to start with the Serbian folk kolo Srbijanka. \"Dardaneli\" became the most popular kafana after the 1896 reconstruction, a pivot for actors, writers, singing societies, and the central point of city's urban spirit and bohemianism. It was founded in 1855 by Arif Bey, the Turk. Ownership changed a lot, being owned by a Serbian woman Stojana in 1858, as she received it as a dowry. It had billiard tables.

As Palilula limited music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dor\u0107ol section to continue with festivities.As \"Velika Srbija\" itself was soon demolished to make way for the \"Hotel Moskva\", Skadarlija became the central nightlife point of Belgrade.

The last \"officially unofficial\" brothel from this period was located in the ground-floor house in the \u010cika Ljubina Street, behind the modern Instituto Cervantes building. The house was demolished much later, in the early 1990s. Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903.At the turn of the 19th and the 20th century, Belgrade had one hospitality or catering venue per 50 inhabitants.

They were visiting small cookshops, soup kitchens and lowest quality venues. Among the most luxurious and exclusive nightlife locales during the Interbellum was \"Srpski Kralj\", at the corner of Uzun-Mirkova and Pariska streets. The lavish hotel was described as an \"ornament\" of the city, with \"equally beautiful interior and exterior\". It was completely destroyed during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941.

The premiere was attended by king Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 and queen mother Natalie. Prior to that, after the Serbian-Turkish wars from 1876 to 1878, it was the favorite place of the politicians, both liberal and conservative ones. In 1909 the venue moved to Skadarlija and later another kafana, \"Du\u0161anov Grad\", was opened instead on Terazije. By the 21st century, it was turned into the gambling venue.. \"Zlatni \u0161aran\"; located in Jalija, lower section of Dor\u0107ol.

As Zemun was a border town between Austria(-Hungary) and Turkey/Serbia, from 1730 to 1871 there was Kontumac, or the quarantine hospital, on the location of the modern City Park. As Zemun was an important trading post, Kontumac was also a duty-free zone. It contained residential quarters during stay in the zone. Having large number of people in one place, hospitality and catering services developed around the zone, and numerous kafanas were opened: \"Kod zlatnog krsta\", \"Kod zlatnog to\u010dka\", \"Kod cara\", \"Kod zlatnog slona\", \"Kod zlatnog sunca\", etc. Modern period. After World War II, night life dwindled. City was heavily damaged, population was cut by half, and it took a while to establish a proper public transportation grid to allow the commuting. Apart from the surviving \"legends\", new kafanas which became centers of night life in the 1950s-1960s were adjoined to the sports clubs and stadiums, like \"Mladi Proleter\", \"Sin\u0111eli\u0107\", \"Obili\u0107\" or \"Stadion\". Clientele often included footballers and other athletes. Another hub of night life included riverbank kafanas held by the fishermen, especially in Zemun. Popular entertainment and technological progress also hampered the importance of kafanas. Radio Belgrade began airing non-stop, including immensely popular comedy shows which emptied the streets, like the Joyful Evening (Veselo ve\u010de). In 1958 the broadcast of the Television Belgrade began.In the mid-1950s, renovated \"Lotos Bar\" was opened in Zmaj Jovina Street.

It became instant sensation. As members of the new Communists political establishment became regular visitors and the bar slipped from not-so-hidden striptease club into the, also not-so-hidden prostitution locale, the working hours were constantly extended. In order to repeal the common people, the entry prices, and especially drinks, skyrocketed. Similar venues soon followed: \"Kristal Bar\", bars in the \"Ma\u017eestik\" and \"Metropol\" hotels, and numerous striptease clubs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, all were closed.The street prostitution developed since the late 1960s. The sex workers operated on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and became known as stoperke (\"hitchhiker girls\"). As a result, a row of inns was built along the Pan\u010devo and Zrenjanin roads. Another long surviving location was the Economy Faculty's Park, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned a moniker Picin park [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed kamenjarke (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. Another location, which in time became synonymous for prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medakovi\u0107. Old style brothels also continued, followed in the 1990s by the porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija.

Exceptions were \"Fontana\" in the neighborhood of the same name, \"Pri Majolka\", later renamed \"Vojvodina\", in the shopping mall \"Old Merkator\", and the oldest \"D\u017eakarta\", across the Studentski Grad, better known by its original and present name \"To\u0161in Bunar\".As the first kafana on the boat, \"Split\" has historical importance as the precursor of splavovi. The restaurant was opened in 1970, but the ship was much older. On the orders of the Serbian Royal Navy Society, it was built in 1892 in Regensburg, Germany, as the luxurious paddle steamer, and originally named Emperor Nicholas II. It was sent mostly on diplomatic missions, like International Danube Commission. It was part of the ill-fated Kladovo transport in World War II. After the war it was renamed Split, docked under the Branko's Bridge, and adapted into the restaurant. The steerage was adapted into the private rooms and used for prostitution, so the police often raided the venue. The ship  is since 1992 on the dry dock in Kladovo, being declared a cultural monument in 2006.In time kafanas evolved into the westernized restaurants, but many traditional ones survived, and remained part of Belgrade's tourist offer. Even today kafanas have been described as the \"soul of Belgrade\".

Skadarlija. Skadarlija partially preserved the ambience of the traditional urban architecture, including its archaic urban organization, and is known as the main bohemian quarter of Belgrade, similar to Paris' Montmartre. As similar Bohemian quarters, Skadarlija and Montmartre twinned on 22 October 1977. It began to develop in 1830 with the settlement of Gypsies in the abandoned trenches in front of the ramparts, followed by the Serbs and the Turks after 1835. An aqueduct, essentially a wall through the center of the street, was later constructed to conduct the stream of Bibijin Potok underground. The largest arch of the aqueduct was named Skadar, so in 1872 the street was named Skadarska Street.Soon after the aqueduct was built, the first khans, precursors of later kafanas, were built along the foothill of the wall. Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901 and demolition of \"Dardaneli\". In the early 20the century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: \"Tri \u0161e\u0161ira\", \"Dva jelena\", \"Zlatni bokal\", \"Bandist\", \"East\", \"Guild\", \"Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107\", \"Bums Keler\", \"Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107\", \"The Two Sergeants\" and \"Mala Pijaca\".

In the late 19th century, \"Pa\u0161onin Bulevar\" at the beginning of the street, was the very first Belgrade's music hall.The renovation and restoration of Skadarlija began in 1968 in accordance with the designs made by the group of prominent artists. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduced modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of young and bohemian artists. Since 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a \"bohemian flag\". There is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. It includes the types of dishes on the menus, types of uniforms, table clothes or music allowed, and the knowledge of foreign languages. The symbol of Skadarlija is a Fedora hat, mentioned in numerous folk songs, especially the in the starogradska musical style, a form of older urban folk music,  another emblematic feature of Skadarlija.After decades of performing in restaurants and outdoors, some performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers Toma Zdravkovi\u0107, Silvana Armenuli\u0107, Olga Jan\u010devecka. Especially popular was Sofka Nikoli\u0107. The first folk music star of newly formed Yugoslavia in the 1920s and 1930s, she published dozens of records, becoming one of the most commercial female singers in Europe. Musicians from Europe and United States were visiting her in Skadarlija, including Josephine Baker, who befriended her. Called \"Queen of Skadarlija\", Nikoli\u0107 withdrew in 1939 when her young daughter, her only child, died. \u010cubura. Another neighborhood synonymous for bohemian life was \u010cubura.

Differences included the clientele as Skadarlija was considered to be a fancy and fashionable place while \u010cubura used to be a gathering place of common people, and decades long communal neglect of \u010cubura compared to constant renovations in Skadarlija, which gave \u010cubura a certain flavor. In 1941, on the short distance along the Makenzijeva Street there were 30 kafanas. \u010cubura was described as \"one vast kafana, open all hours\".After 1945, \"Vltava\" (originally named \"Toplica\") became a layer's gathering place, \"Mala Vltava\" of the former political prisoners from the Goli Otok while the more affluent citizens gathered in \"Trandafilovi\u0107\". \"Ora\u010d\" was originally opened in Savinac. Though opened in 1949 on the location of former broadcloth making shop, it was remembered as \"being much older\". The venue was famous for its grill menu. Public protests and petitions followed its closing in 1996, when it was relocated to another location in \u010cubura, where former Vltava used to be. It was closed in January 2015. \"Mlava\", at 52 Cara Nikolaja, was an iconic kafana, known for \"having a soul\". Never a fancy locale, it reached its heyday in the 1970s and got \"frozen in the 1980s\", with traditional interior. It hosted equally bohemian, artistic elite, local population and construction workers from the nearby sites. By the 2010s it regained iconic status of the small, pampered oasis with the younger clientele and foreign visitors, but still was closed on 1 March 2013 as one of the last remaining \"true Belgrade kafanas\".\"Trandafilovi\u0107\" was founded in 1929, and demolished in 1961 when authorities planned to cut the old plane tree in restaurants yard.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_23": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "By the 2010s it regained iconic status of the small, pampered oasis with the younger clientele and foreign visitors, but still was closed on 1 March 2013 as one of the last remaining \"true Belgrade kafanas\".\"Trandafilovi\u0107\" was founded in 1929, and demolished in 1961 when authorities planned to cut the old plane tree in restaurants yard. After public protests, including poet Libero Markoni who physically prevented workers from cutting the tree, authorities backed off. New building on the same location was finished in 1967 and the kafana moved in again. In the 21st century it was closed and turned into the household chemicals shop. The plane tree survived and under it, a bistro named \"Trandafilovi\u0107\" was opened. Modern \u010cubura Park was built where the \"Kikevac\" kafana was located. As it was the central gathering point of the migrants from Crna Trava, the most famous builders in Serbia, a monument dedicated to the nameless \"Crna Trava builder\" was erected in the park in 2019.Unlike preserved Skadarlija, \u010cubura's bohemianism was completely extinguished by the 2020s. Kafanas were closed one by one and the \"spirit of \u010cubura\" disappeared. One of the last kafanas, \"Kolubara\", was transformed into the betting facility while the famed \"\u010cuburska lipa\" was demolished in early 2018. It was named after the linden tree, planted in 1924, brought from Lipik spa. The tree was also cut. \"Sokolac\", at the corner of the Maksima Gorkog and Sazonova streets, was closed in 2017.

The main, garden facing fa\u00e7ade is made of 5 arched, glassed openings. The middle one serves as the door between the winter salon and summer garden. Main entrance is on the side of the building. It was named after the golf courses built in 1936, initiated by the regent, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. There were 9 greens, considered by the foreign ambassadors \"among the most beautiful in Europe\". The building was restored in 1946. It was originally used as the children's vacation and recuperation facility.

Due to the volatile history in the Balkans, various kafanas served as gathering places and recruitment centers for numerous wars and rebellions: \"Crni Konj\" (Zadarska Street; for individual fighters in the Serbian-Ottoman Wars), \"Kragujevac\" (Kara\u0111or\u0111eva Street); Garibalidians, Italian volunteers in the Serbian-Turkish Wars of 1876\u20131878, \"Zlatni Krst\" (Serbian volunteers for the same conflict), etc.Kafanas were also important for the economy. First public places for drafting contracts and merchant treaties were kafanas. This is why they originally developed around the main merchant areas and old khans. They were socially important as they allowed for the poor classes to participate in economic activities, too.

In the new, Communist regime, new types of music became almost obligatory, like the kozara\u010dko kolo, but in the period immediately following the Allied victory this music was mixed with Russian romances, jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. Western music especially became popular after the film Sun Valley Serenade with Glenn Miller's music reached Yugoslav cinemas. Dances included tango, waltz, foxtrot, slowfox, and especially popular trucking, or treskavac in Serbian (\"shaking dance\"). However, with political changes regime's attitude soon switched. By the end of 1945 the American music was labeled as \"capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies\". Accused of undermining discipline and public moral, the trucking was officially banned in the early 1946. By 1951 the state propaganda attacked boogie-woogie (\"eccentric, vulgar and decadent\"), while entire public campaign was orchestrated in 1952 against jazz, which \"influenced the animal sensations\". This first post war period of dance nights lasted from 1945 to 1963.First night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. First rock and roll news can be found in press already in 1956. Public reaction lacked the disputes and rage of the previous types of music, like jazz or contemporary dance in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It appeared that the older generations didn't perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS (\"vocal-instrumental band\").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it.

Some had passes, but they were easily obtained. Still, the security guards had a great latitude letting someone in. People were searched and checked whether they are underage or intoxicated. First clubs were small and located in private houses and apartments with city authorities being bent on closing them. Euridika. Predecessor of the future disco clubs opened in Vra\u010dar, in a private house at 33 Molerova Street in 1961, becoming one of the most important cultural hotspots in the late 1960s. The club was an offshoot of the Youth Theater DADOV, founded in 1958. The idea was that, through drinks and dance nights, the money for the theater will be collected. Once a week, a Club of the popular music lovers gathered here. The building itself was built in 1921 and was the pre-war house of the Tomi\u0107 family. Performers, some of which launched their careers here, included Elipse, Safiri, Zlatni De\u010daci, Dobri Drugovi, Crni Biseri, Crni Panteri (founded by the students from Congo Kinshasa), Boba Stefanovi\u0107, etc.  When Crni Panteri performed Shake Your Hips, the ecstatic audience trashed and broke the furniture. The audience was mostly divided in two groups: the Beatles fans and the Rolling Stones fans. It was closed in the late 1970s. Youth Center - 202.

It was adapted into the discoth\u00e8que \"202\" in 1969 in collaboration with Radio Belgrade 202 station which directly broadcast the program from the club. The disco was noted for the lack of problems or incidents and as a meeting place of the children from the wealthy families (\"working class youth almost couldn't be seen in it\"). In the late 1970s, it became the gathering place for the punk enthusiasts. Kod Laze \u0160e\u0107era. First proper disco in Belgrade, \"Kod Laze \u0160e\u0107era\", was opened on 24 April 1967. It was announced that Lord Snowdon would attend the event, but he didn't show up. The venue was located at 17 Ive Lole Ribara Street (today Svetogorska), in the Jevrem Gruji\u0107's House, in Stari Grad. It was close to the Atelje 212 theatre, so at the opening almost the entire acting troop was present, so as the dramatists, authors, painters, etc., including Mira Trailovi\u0107, Jovan \u0106irilov, Ivan Tabakovi\u0107, Du\u0161an Mati\u0107. Founder of the disco was Lazar \u0160e\u0107erovi\u0107, a translator, bon vivant and direct descendant of Jevrem Gruji\u0107. At the time of opening, other discos existed only in Paris, London and Milan, while it was 10 years before the famous Studio 54 in New York City was opened.

The venue was small, situated in the basement, but still was a major improvement in the nightlife offer in the city, credited with \"democratization of fun\".The club introduced several other \"firsts\", like girls without male companions, people dancing alone or after parties when selected groups would move to the upper floor for more quiet fun. The club was also called \"Lola\", after the street, and was hailed as the \"only disco between Trieste and Vladivostok\". Guests included members of the international jet-set who visited Belgrade: Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Catherine Deneuve, Judi Dench, Nina Ricci, Omar Sharif, Marisa Berenson, Alain Delon, Claudia Cardinale. During the day, rock bands were practicing in the club. The venue also hosted the first pop art exhibition in Yugoslavia, which included Roy Lichtenstein's graphics and Andy Warhol's lithographs.Opening was supported by the basketball club KK Crvena Zvezda. Though all the necessary permits were obtained, not everything went smooth. Municipal authorities debated about it, and some described it as a \"lair for the young alcoholics, junkies, debauchers and rich kids.\" Owners claimed that the venue is a clean and decent location, adapted with taste which included the green Italian wallpapers and black floor linoleum. They also defended the club naming celebrities who were regular guests: Milena Dravi\u0107, Vera \u010cuki\u0107, Arsen Dedi\u0107, Branko Ple\u0161a, Biljana Nevajda.

Neighboring citizens were against the club. They tried administratively to prevent it from being open but when that failed, they sabotaged the venue as they could, like throwing garbage at the guests who were entering the house. Concerns showed to be substantiated in the beginning, as the guests were making loud noise at the entrance and unbridled youngsters, mostly of wealthy parents, were causing too much of a commotion with their cars, vespas and motorbikes. Owners later placed two guards outside who had a specific duty to keep the noise down.The club came under the attack of numerous bans and regulations, including the one which allowed dancing, but banned music. The authorities also accused the club of playing \"enemy music\", of destroying the morality of the Socialist youth and declared it a CIA headquarters in Yugoslavia. Military generals in the state's Supreme Defense Council concluded that club has to be closed. Fighting both the authorities and the neighbors proved too much for the owners, so they closed the club in 1968. Still, it remains as the first such venue in entire Yugoslavia and the wider region of the Communist ruled states. For a while, secret parties continued to be organized. KST. KST, short for \"Klub studenata tehnike\", was unofficially established in 1952 for the students of three technical faculties (architecture, electrical engineering and civil engineering). It was located in one of the laboratories, almost in the basement, at 73 Bulevar Revolucije, today Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. High School for Technical Engineering, to which the faculties were subordinated at the time, made the club official in March 1954 which was used both for studying and dance parties.Disco was opened on 29 February 1968. Originally, it had only one magnetophon. The music was various:  funk, soul, disco, rock and roll, twist, waltz.

The first \"unplugged\" concert in the Balkans was performed here by the Bijelo Dugme. Many groups recorded albums here. In time, it became \"another house\" for musicians, and the club which \"makes DJs\". The club also organized theatrical and poetry evenings, freshmen welcome parties, fashion shows and the famous pre-New Year's Eve masquerade balls. Performers included greatest stars of Serbian acting, like Ljuba Tadi\u0107, Olivera Markovi\u0107, Sne\u017eana Savi\u0107, Tanja Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, Petar Kralj and Ljuba Moljac. The venue also became an important place for public debates and discussions.The club was always known for the relaxed, home-style dress code (sweaters, hoodies, plaid shirts, no heavy make-up, high heels, tight jackets, etc.). As one of the first students' and night clubs in the city, and the only one from this period that still works, KST achieved cult status among the city youth. A 2019 documentary about KST was filmed by Zoran Bulovi\u0107, commemorating venue's 65th anniversary. SKC. \"Studentski Kulturni Centar\", shortened to SKC, was opened in 1968 at 48 Kralja Milana Street.

The SKC have two main spaces inside: small club on the ground level and larger hall at the first floor. Parts of the building serve as the caf\u00e9 and as the bookstore, and the venue also hosts art exhibitions. As of 2023, SKC is still operational. Joyfull 1970s. At the start of the decade the night life for the young was still undeveloped. Reports lamented that, \"unfortunately\", kafanas were still predominant. The alcohol was freely served to the minors, while in some venues dinner was obligatory. Modern kafanas, adapted for the youth, didn't exist. There were only several dance halls where \"better bands\" performed, the rest organized \"typically dilettante and irresponsible\" dance parties. Only few had jukeboxes or other \"automated musical machines\". Most popular disco clubs were \"Youth Center\", \"Go-Go Dancing\" in Ta\u0161majdan and \"Disco Club 202\" in the old synagogue in Zemun. All youth venues had expensive tickets.However, later in the 1970s, Belgrade began to resemble other world metropolises. Numerous internationally important events developed: theatrical festival BITEF, film festival FEST (1970), musical festival BEMUS, Belgrade jazz festival (1973), Belgrade review of Yugoslav film (1973), etc. Regarding night life, fashion or music, everything was generally toned down from the wild 1960s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_46": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "All youth venues had expensive tickets.However, later in the 1970s, Belgrade began to resemble other world metropolises.

Major influence came from the Western Europe, mainly through Italy, and was considered as something modern and advanced. Rock and roll was especially popular.By the mid-1970s, disco clubs turned into the exclusive venues and the entry fees became too high, though some included a drink. Drinks, in general, also became expensive as various inspection rarely visited the venues, so visitors smuggled alcohol into the clubs. Though the largest crowds were during weekends, the clubs were open during the entire week, usually having only one non-working day, varying from club to club. Working hours mostly didn't extend after 2 a.m. In order to avoid the intent of the authorities to close them, the clubs secured patronage of some state-owned institution, usually a sport society, and were registered as the \"restaurants with music\". In 1978, a modern caffe bar \"Zlatni papagaj\" was opened in the \u0110ure Jak\u0161i\u0107a Street. It was planned as the standing bar for quick drinks, so it had no chairs.In the late 1970s, a \"Dijalog\" was opened in U\u0161\u0107e, the first restaurant on the proper boat, as opposed to the later ones opened on the barges. After Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 came to power in the late 1980s, he was interviewed on \"Dijalog\" by The Times correspondent Dessa Trevisan. Crveno i crno.

In 1971, \"Cepelin\", the best and the most famous disco in Yugoslavia was opened. Some chroniclers consider it the first proper disco club in Belgrade, open to everyone. It was located at 28 Ilije Gara\u0161anina Street, in Ta\u0161majdan. Its opening was described as night life's \"excelleration\". At the opening night, state and military top officials and members of the diplomatic corps were present. The caviar was served from the Josip Broz Tito's plates. At the peak of its popularity, \"Cepelin\" had 10,000 members. It had three dance floors, state of the art sound system and the interior was patterned after the famed London club \"La Valbonne\": floors covered with the black artificial leather, dominant brass ornaments, luxurious booths, plush covered armchairs, twenty different types of mirrors, 1,000 colored lightbulbs, and strobe lights above each dance floor. It also had blacklights, projector which emitted psychedelic music videos on the walls which were mostly black. The rooms were stuffy and the colors of the lights changed depending on the DJ who was working that night. Parts of the walls and furniture were in red, with colorful flower prints.The most popular persons in the venue included DJ Mister \u010cupko, and the head-to-toe tattooed main bouncer, nicknamed Oumpah-pah after the comic book character. \u0110or\u0111e Bo\u017eovi\u0107 Gi\u0161ka and his entourage were the regulars.

It was opened by Sa\u0161a Nikoli\u0107 and had working hours of 16:00-21:00 (matin\u00e9e, for the minors) and 21:00-24:00, for adults, with strict rules on not allowing the minors to stay during the later program. DJs, including Sa\u0161a Radosavljevi\u0107 and Ra\u0161a Petrovi\u0107, were located in the glass booth above the dance podium. It was renovated and expanded in the mid-1970s and included live performances from the most popular Yugoslav rock bands. Most frequent performers were the Korni Grupa. \"Cepelin\" was closed in 1980.

Other musicians who performed included Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, Partibrejkers, Psihomodo Pop, Toni Montano, etc. Visitors of the elite discos avoided it completely as it was considered a \"hole which shocks and provokes\". \"Akademija\" was an important part in the growing up and maturing of generations to come and survived until 2011, when it was finally closed,. Despite the public protests, petitions and online activism from the fans and the celebrities, city refused to help with the situation and the debt-collectors closed the venue.\"Akademija\" is described today as a \"separate state\" during the 1980s, and \"city phenomenon\", West-oriented, which forged a new culture of having fun, influenced by the unique concerts on the stage which was right next to the audience.

Rivaling club \"Zvezda\" was opposed to \"Akademija\" in every way, including the location: it was right across, at 51 Knez Mihailova Street, at the back entrance into the basement of the Gr\u010dka Kraljica restaurant. Opened in 1983, it became the symbol of the fanciness, with diametrically opposite interiors, music and general concept from \"Akademija\". In order to get a membership card for \"Zvezda\", people needed political and other connections, but the best pass was a modern and attractive look. This included expensive imported perfumes and wardrobe. Rivaling clubs were so different, that just by someone's attire, you might guess where they will enter.

Visiting these venues was a high risk.Disco clubs lost the top position in night fun, as young people turned to the folkotheques (disco clubs with turbo-folk music) and splavovi,  or barge-clubs. Among the most popular barges were \"Lukas\", where singer Aca Lukas started his folk career, assuming the splav's name as his own alias, \"Mozzart\" (which sank after 2000) and \"Triton\".
