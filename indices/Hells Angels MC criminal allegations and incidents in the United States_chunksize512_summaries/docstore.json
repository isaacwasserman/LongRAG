Authorities discovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons, including explosives and automatic weapons, during a search related to the investigation. Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for the assault.\n\nFurthermore, sixteen members and associates of the HA's South Carolina Nomads chapter were convicted of crimes related to the RICO Act following a two-year investigation by the FBI, ATF, SLED, and local police departments.
