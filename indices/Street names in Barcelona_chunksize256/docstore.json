El Raval neighborhood (\"slum\") was also gradually formed, initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings.The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to expand the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from San Pedro de las Puelles to the Atarazanas, facing the sea.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_22": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The enclosure had eight new gates, some of which gave their name to various enclaves of the city that still remain: the Portal del Angel, which gave its name to an avenue; the Puertaferrisa, whose name is on a street; or La Boqueria, remembered in a street and a square, as well as a market.In the 13th century, Ancha Street was opened, connecting Santa Maria del Mar with Framenors. It was once the widest street in the city, hence its name, and was the residence of wealthy families who built numerous palaces there.

The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.This century was one of constant political changes and struggles between liberals and conservatives, which was often reflected in the gazetteer. The first political moment in which there was a dance of names was during the Liberal Triennium (1820-1823), although it was only reflected in three names: Pla de Palau became Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (Constitution Square), Plaza de San Jaime became Plaza de la Soberan\u00eda Nacional (State Sovereignty Square), and Plaza de San Agust\u00edn became Plaza de la Igualdad (Equality Square).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_32": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The first two recovered their names after the triennium \u2014 with a brief period in which Pla de Palau was called Pla\u00e7a dels Cercs (1823-1825) \u2014 but the third remained until the Franco dictatorship..

In 1883 the cemetery of Montju\u00efc was inaugurated, which due to its extension was divided into streets that received names of religious sign.

The new names incorporated a new ordinance drafted in 1905 that established the dedication of personalities only ten years after their death.Different criteria were used to name the new streets: towns in Catalonia (Agramunt, Arb\u00f3s, Calaf, Cambrils, Escornalbou); counties in Catalonia (Panad\u00e9s, Priorat, La Selva); Spanish regions (Asturias, Extremadura, Castile, Canary Islands); illustrious personalities of the towns added (Agust\u00ed Mil\u00e0, Pons i Gallarza, Guillem Tell); personalities of the cultural world (Bret\u00f3n de los Herreros, Marian Aguil\u00f3, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, Jules Verne, Voltaire, Zola, Frederic Soler);", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_54": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Guillem Tell); personalities of the cultural world (Bret\u00f3n de los Herreros, Marian Aguil\u00f3, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, Jules Verne, Voltaire, Zola, Frederic Soler); republican or liberal figures (Doctor Rizal, Estanislao Figueras, V\u00edctor Balaguer, R\u00edos Rosas, Rossend Ar\u00fas, Su\u00f1er y Capdevila, Vidal y Valenciano); names from the workers' movement (La Internacional, \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, Emancipaci\u00f3n); and figures from the past (Socrates, Pythagoras, Rubens, Titian, Pasteur, Mistral). The aggregation also revealed a phenomenon that occurred frequently between the 19th and early 20th centuries: many plots of land previously used for agriculture were developed by their owners, who often gave their own name or that of their relatives to the newly created roads.

On the other hand, the conservative ideology of the Lliga was reflected in the dedication of some streets to businessmen and characters of the bourgeoisie, such as the Rambla de Santa Eulalia, which became Passeig de Fabra i Puig, for the businessmen Fabra i Puig brothers; on the other hand, the proposal to dedicate the Rambla de Catalunya to Eusebi G\u00fcell did not prosper.In 1914 Manicomio road was renamed Doctor Pi i Molist street, after the doctor and writer Emili Pi i Molist.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_63": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The following year Avinguda de Pearson was created, dedicated to Frederick Stark Pearson, founder of the Barcelona Traction electric company.

At the beginning, there were a series of changes that were not officially recognized, as happened during the war, and soon after they were disallowed: Paseo de Pi i Margall was named after General Mola, although it finally kept its previous name, Paseo de Gracia; Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a was renamed Plaza del Ej\u00e9rcito Espa\u00f1ol, but eventually kept its name; Gran V\u00eda de las Cortes Catalanas was initially dedicated to General Goded, but was officially awarded to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera; V\u00eda Durruti was assigned to Jos\u00e9 Antonio,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_83": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "but eventually kept its name; Gran V\u00eda de las Cortes Catalanas was initially dedicated to General Goded, but was officially awarded to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera; V\u00eda Durruti was assigned to Jos\u00e9 Antonio, but later recovered the name of V\u00eda Layetana; and Plaza Hermanos Badia was provisionally called Plaza del Ej\u00e9rcito Marroqu\u00ed, but later received the name of Calvo Sotelo.At a meeting of the Permanent Municipal Commission held on February 25, 1939 it was agreed: The changes of names of the streets and squares of this city and school groups, in order to honor the heroes and martyrs of the Homeland and erase the memory of the passage of the horde through Barcelona, which sullied it with names of undesirables and foreigners, restoring, in addition, the traditional names of the city.

This meant a radical change without regard for any consideration, without taking into account that not all Republican changes were of political sign, but that there were municipal agreements and changes aimed at alleviating duplicities, which with the reversion occurred again. Names that were not in line with the new regime also reappeared, such as Pau Casals, which in 1934 was changed from an alley in La Verneda to an avenue between Diagonal and Tur\u00f3 Park, previously called Victor Hugo; the former alley was renamed Crist\u00f2for de Dom\u00e8nech, but with the Francoist reversion it became Pau Casals again, while the avenue returned to Victor Hugo, neither of them to the liking of the regime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_85": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Finally, the avenue was renamed General Goded, but Pau Casals Street remained until 1961, when the land where it was located was transferred to San Adri\u00e1n de Bes\u00f3s.Another consequence of the reversion is that several newly developed streets that had been baptized for the first time during the Republic were left without a name, just a number or a letter, which is the usual designation of the new streets until their nomination. Subsequently, the names they had received were reviewed, and in many cases in which they were not names of a political sign, the Republican designation was revalidated.There were few exceptions to the reversion of names: Tom\u00e1s Mieres street did not revert to General Arlegui, as it had been named in 1924; the plaza de la Sagrada Familia kept its name, instead of the General Barrera it received in 1927, perhaps because it was a religious name; nor was Gaud\u00ed avenue, which had previously been called General Primo de Rivera, initially changed, but in 1942 the change did occur, which was maintained until 1963, when the general was transferred to Ancha street; The Paseo and Plaza de Maragall,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_86": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "initially changed, but in 1942 the change did occur, which was maintained until 1963, when the general was transferred to Ancha street; The Paseo and Plaza de Maragall, formerly Mart\u00ednez Anido and Magaz, respectively, also remained, apparently because someone remembered that Maragall had translated Goethe \u2014 the Germans were allies of the Franco regime \u2014 although Mart\u00ednez Anido was later given the Paseo de la Industria (now Picasso's).There were also six exceptions to the reversion policy, all of them to honor the new leaders, approved on March 7, 1939: Avenida Catorce de Abril to General\u00edsimo Franco (now Avenida Diagonal), Gran V\u00eda de las Cortes Catalanas to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, Avenida de Pedralbes to Victoria, Paseo de Ferm\u00edn Gal\u00e1n to Sal\u00f3n de V\u00edctor Pradera (now Paseo de Llu\u00eds Companys), Plaza de los Hermanos Badia to Calvo Sotelo (now Francesc Maci\u00e0),", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_87": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Plaza de los Hermanos Badia to Calvo Sotelo (now Francesc Maci\u00e0), and Paseo de Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez to General Mola (Paseo de San Juan in its section between Diagonal and Gracia).The rest of the public roads returned to their traditional names, as can be seen in a resolution of the Ministry of the Interior of March 1939: Paseo de Gracia, Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a, Calle de Fernando, Calle de la Princesa, Las Rondas, Plaza de San Jaime, etc. will return to their old nomenclature, without prejudice to the City Council proceeding to a thorough revision of the names prior to 1931 that recall the antecedents of the Red-Separatist domination of this city, to honor other heroes and martyrs of the National Movement, to whom the roads in the project will also be dedicated. Even so, between 1939 and 1942 several changes took place: Avinguda de Francesc Layret (Paralelo) to Marqu\u00e9s del Duero, Sabino de Arana to General Sanjurjo, Avinguda de Pau Casals to General Goded,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_88": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Sabino de Arana to General Sanjurjo, Avinguda de Pau Casals to General Goded, Avinguda Presa de les Drassanes to Garcia Morato, Avinguda de la Generalitat to Roma, Par\u00eds (a section) to Berl\u00edn, Par\u00eds (another section) to Avenida de Madrid, Tarragona (a section) to Numancia, Garc\u00eda Lorca to Obispo Irurita, carretera de Montju\u00efc to Divisi\u00f3n Azul, plaza de Pi y Margall to Victoria, plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n to Unificaci\u00f3n, La Internacional to Naci\u00f3n, plaza de Salvat-Papasseit to Virrey Amat, plaza de Canuda to Villa de Madrid, Llobregat to P\u00e1rroco Juliana, Robert Robert to Ramiro de Maeztu, etc. Several new streets were also baptized: Alc\u00e1zar de Toledo, Belchite, Plaza de los Ca\u00eddos, Plaza de los H\u00e9roes de Espinosa de los Monteros, Salvador Anglada and Teniente Coronel Gonz\u00e1lez Tablas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_89": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In 1940, the square created by the burying of the railroad from Barcelona to Sarri\u00e1 was named Plaza de Gala Placidia, after the wife of the Visigoth king Ata\u00falfo, who had his court in Barcelona.In these years the street of Pau Claris was also eliminated, which was awarded to its extension towards the sea, the Via Layetana, receiving the same name. On the other hand, Calle de Casanova was kept, dedicated to Rafael Casanova, perhaps because the surname alone was not so closely related to the character, and could be understood as belonging to another Casanova. The street of 26 de Enero was also maintained, which commemorated the Catalan victory of 1641 in the Reapers' War, because it coincided with the date of Franco's entry into Barcelona.A new regulation of the nomenclature was made in a municipal session held on July 7, 1942, which ratified the reversion of Republican names and the changes made between 1939 and 1942, as well as collecting a series of new changes, some of new streets and others derived from a purge of names prior to the Republic but that had some leftist or Catalanist bias.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_90": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Some of these changes were: Democr\u00e0cia to Movimiento Nacional, Autonom\u00eda to Unidad, Solidaridad to Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Igualdad to \u00c1lava, Joaquim Folguera to N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Arce, Su\u00f1er i Capdevila to Beato Almat\u00f3, Zola to Padre La\u00ednez, Paseo de Castelar to Donoso Cort\u00e9s, Laureano Figuerola to Nilo Fabra, Mendiz\u00e1bal to Junta de Comercio, Pere Joan Sala to General Almirante, Pau Alsina to Secretario Coloma, Josep Nonell to Alcalde de M\u00f3stoles, etc.. The new gazetteer, published in 1943, also stipulated the labeling in Spanish.

Thus, public streets such as the Plaza de Juliana Morell (nun and poet), the Pasaje de Magdalena Giralt (wife of General Josep Moragues who was imprisoned for defending the memory of her husband), the Calle de Ot\u00edlia Castellv\u00ed (poumista militiaman), or the jardines de Emma de Barcelona (founder of the monastery of San Juan de las Abadesas), to cite just a few examples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_114": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_114", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Public spaces have also been dedicated to international female figures such as Rosa Luxemburg, Frida Kahlo, Isadora Duncan, Marie Curie, Sarah Bernhardt, Simone de Beauvoir, Virginia Woolf and Anne Frank.

The Olympics. Another of Barcelona's profound transformations came on the occasion of the 1992 Olympic Games. The event involved the remodeling of part of the mountain of Montju\u00efc, where the so-called Olympic Ring (1985-1992), a large enclosure that houses several sports facilities, such as the Olympic Stadium Llu\u00eds Companys and the Palau Sant Jordi, was located.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_115": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_115", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "This site is located on an avenue called Passeig de Minicius Natal, a military man and senator of Roman Barcino who was the first Barcelonian to win a medal at the Olympic Games; the promenade is located between the squares of Europa and Nemesi Ponsati, a promoter of sport in Barcelona, president of the Barcelona Swimming Club. In Montju\u00efc several roads were also named in memory of the games, such as the Olympic promenade, the street of the 92 Games and the street of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games.For the accommodation of the athletes, a new neighborhood was built, the Olympic Village of Poblenou (1985-1992), with a general layout by the firm MBM Arquitectes.

The turn of the century did not bring any substantial changes in the nomenclature, as the same criteria followed since the return of democracy continued. One of the first urban planning projects of the new millennium was the creation of the 22@ district, thanks to a modification of the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM. In Catalan: \"Pla General Metropolit\u00e0\") in 2000. Its objective was to reformulate the industrial land in the El Poblenou neighborhood, a traditionally industrial sector that was to be reformulated by focusing on companies dedicated to new technologies. The name comes from the code that the PGM applies to urban industrial land, 22a, changing this \"a\" for the @ as a symbol of information and communication technologies.In 2000, a piece of land in San Andr\u00e9s was also urbanized after the relocation of the La Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima factory,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_119": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_119", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In 2000, a piece of land in San Andr\u00e9s was also urbanized after the relocation of the La Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima factory, whose streets were given names related to the factory: parque de La Maquinista de San Andr\u00e9s, calle and jardines de La Maquinista de La Campana, and calles de La Maquinista de las Naves, los Puentes and los Trenes.Between 2002 and 2003 several streets in the Zona Franca were named after concepts related to the struggle for peace and human rights: Amnist\u00eda Internacional, Derechos Humanos, Gernika (city bombed in 1937), Soweto (for the 1976 revolt against racial discrimination in South Africa), Jane Addams (pacifist and suffragette, Nobel Peace Prize in 1931) and Francesc Boix i Campo (photographer interned in Mauthausen).In 2003 it was decided to dedicate to Salvador Dal\u00ed a square located in front of the Sagrera AVE Station, which has not yet materialized due to the delay in the execution of the works of the station.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_120": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_120", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In 2003 it was decided to dedicate to Salvador Dal\u00ed a square located in front of the Sagrera AVE Station, which has not yet materialized due to the delay in the execution of the works of the station.One of the most outstanding events of the new millennium was the celebration of the Universal Forum of Cultures 2004, which allowed new urban changes in the city: the entire Bes\u00f3s area, until then populated by old disused factories, was recovered, the entire Pueblo Nuevo neighborhood was regenerated and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood was built, while the city was provided with new parks and spaces for the leisure of the citizens. The main spaces named for the event were the squares of the Forum, Ernest Lluch, Willy Brandt, Leonardo Da Vinci, and the Fusilados (for the reprisals of the Franco dictatorship in the Campo de la Bota, whose land was occupied by the Forum).In 2005, several streets in the Port of Barcelona's Inflammables dock were named after international ports: Alexandria, Casablanca, Haifa, Lagos, Miami, Ningbo, and Tianjin.

Other rules to be taken into account are: the use of acronyms and abbreviations on public roads is prohibited; changes of name will only be made in cases of force majeure, so as not to affect the neighborhood; duplicities will be avoided, except in existing streets within the perimeter of the Poble Espanyol; if a duplicity occurs, it will have different typological assignment (for example, street and square); proper names will be written with their original spelling, except in the case of saints, popes, kings or royal personages; streets will not be named after personages solely for the cession of the land; for the dedication of personages,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_132": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "proper names will be written with their original spelling, except in the case of saints, popes, kings or royal personages; streets will not be named after personages solely for the cession of the land; for the dedication of personages, the approval of the family will be sought; the labels of personages will contain their biographical data on at least one of the plaques to be placed.

They specify the name of each street, consisting of a generic name (street, square, promenade, avenue, boulevard, etc.) and a proper name. Some signs also offer information about the odonym, especially in the case of personalities, where their biographical data and their profession or quality for which they acquired relevance are usually indicated.

There are also road signs, which are usually placed on traffic lights or lighting columns, made of steel plate in white and blue colors, which in addition to the name of the road usually indicate the direction with an arrow and the street numbers; and vertical signs, with a white phenolic resin plate, placed on a mast.The labeling of the streets began in 1842 because of the bombardment of the city by General Espartero and the following fine imposed on the people of Barcelona, which forced to have well located the citizenship.
