This rather vague and all-encompassing definition gave rise to many questions throughout the country as to who exactly would be evacuated and in what priority.  The situation was finally clarified on 4 September 1963 with the publication of United States Army Support Group, Vietnam Regulation 59\u20131.

There were two basic reasons for this. First, the realization that the entire deployment in Vietnam was a continual practical exercise, and second the desire to keep non-essential flights to an absolute minimum. Training focused on pilot and crew preparation and certification for their duties, such as Pilot in Command, Instructor Pilot, and so on, or training in new systems.Maintenance support for the detachment's organic aircraft remained above the army's stated minimum goal of 68% aircraft availability during 1963, despite the detachment's heavy workload of 2,094 flying hours for the year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_37": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "This was especially significant since the detachment was designed to operate from one location but was operating from three for the majority of the year. Close coordination with field maintenance units at the locations where aircraft were stationed through the headquarters section at Tan Son Nhut was a dominant factor in maintaining this achievement. However, the crux of all maintenance support rested with the detachment itself and this was where the problems had to be resolved. A heavy work schedule was maintained to keep as many aircraft as possible available for flight. The major burden fell on the two single-ship sections.Requests for aeromedical evacuation were channeled through both Army (Combat Operations Center) and Air Force (Air Operations Center) communications systems to the 57th Medical Detachment as directed in USASGV Regulation 59\u20131. Action on these requests then became the responsibility of the commanding officer of the 57th Medical Detachment.Requests for aeromedical coverage on airmobile assault operations were forwarded directly from the requesting unit to the 57th Medical Detachment, and the 57th's detachment commander would coordinate with the assaulting unit's chain of command on the mission.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_38": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The 57th Medical Detachment had, upon request, covered every major operation in the Republic of Vietnam.

Due to both the detachment's experience and willingness to fly at night most requests for night evacuations came straight to the detachment. An aircraft and crew\u2014a pilot in command, pilot, crew chief, and medic\u2014at all three locations was continually made available for night operations.Since it was the detachment's policy to accept all legitimate requests for aeromedical evacuation whether day or night, the unit was, de facto, available for aeromedical evacuations on a 24-hour basis.Major evacuation for U.S. casualties was provided in the Saigon area.

On assault operation coverage, medical aid was usually first administered to the casualty by the Medical Corps officer that accompanied the assaulting unit into the staging area.Vietnamese casualties were usually transported to the nearest field hospital. If further evacuation to the rear was requested by Vietnamese medical personnel and was not contrary to USASCV Regulation 59\u20131, the request was honored.Patient care as provided by the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 consisted mainly of in-flight and emergency medical treatment. Many times, this treatment was the very first the casualty received and consequently turned out to be a definite lifesaving step. The flight medic also provided limited first aid to patients waiting in the staging areas for further rearward evacuation when time permitted.Throughout the war, although medical evacuation of patients constituted the major workload for the detachment, there were considerable missions in other areas.

The foible that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment was that of providing total aeromedical coverage to both American and Vietnamese combatants and noncombatants in the Republic of Vietnam. Although the Vietnamese were responsible for evacuating their own casualties, many contingencies came into play that prevented them from doing so, such as large numbers of casualties, lack of sufficient aircraft, or large areas to be covered. To better enable the 57th Medical Detachment to provide this vital coverage, it was necessary to split the unit into three operational sections. This resulted in coverage of a greater area, but also resulted in reduced coverage in Saigon and areas further South. However, this was regarded as the lesser of the two operational constraints.This then was the nature of the problem.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_41": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "This resulted in coverage of a greater area, but also resulted in reduced coverage in Saigon and areas further South. However, this was regarded as the lesser of the two operational constraints.This then was the nature of the problem. As evacuation assets were arrayed in 1963, many of the aviation companies were forced to provide tactical aircraft to supplement aeromedical aircraft whenever helicopter ambulances of the 57th Medical Detachment were not available due to either prior commitments or the restrictions imposed by aircraft maintenance. This condition would be relieved to a great extent by the augmentation of another helicopter ambulance unit. At the end of 1963 a study was in preparation by the United States Army Support Group, Vietnam to evaluate such a proposal.Another area that caused problems for the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 was the matter of having to justify the unit's existence to higher headquarters on the basis of yearly flying hours. This was interpreted by the 57th to mean that a unit's worth was solely dependent on the number of hours flown in a given period and not in the actual accomplishments of the unit\u2014for example, the number of patients evacuated or lives saved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_42": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "This was interpreted by the 57th to mean that a unit's worth was solely dependent on the number of hours flown in a given period and not in the actual accomplishments of the unit\u2014for example, the number of patients evacuated or lives saved. This demonstrated that some individuals did not fully understand the real value of having a trained aeromedical evacuation unit available for immediate response to evacuation requests. Since the detachment performed missions for medical evacuation only, the yearly flight time on aircraft depended solely on the number of evacuations requested. Unlike other aviation units, no administrative or logistical missions were performed, and consequently, the detachment's flight time was less than most other units then serving in the Republic of Vietnam. Because of this shortcoming, another study was directed by the U.S. Support Group, Vietnam to determine the feasibility of integrating the 57th Medical Detachment with those of other logistical units for the purpose on increasing its effectiveness.The last problem area identified in 1963 that was worth of mention was that concerning maintenance. As mentioned above, the problem was a result of operating from three distinct sections at Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Saigon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_43": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "As mentioned above, the problem was a result of operating from three distinct sections at Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Saigon.

Despite this, at times no amount of manpower could an aircraft flyable and in this case another aircraft would have to be borrowed from a unit in the immediate vicinity, The limitations on this type of arrangement are readily apparent. The detachment's recommended solution was the deployment of a second air ambulance detachment to Vietnam and the concentration of the 57th's aircraft at one location.During its first year in country, the 57th worked without a tactical call sign, simply using \"Army\" and the tail number of the aircraft. For example, if a pilot were flying a helicopter with the serial number 62-12345, his call sign would be \"Army 12345\".

Major Lloyd Spencer, the 57th's second detachment commander in Vietnam, decided that this improvised system needed to be replaced by something more formal. He visited the Navy Support Activity, Saigon, which controlled all the call signs in South Vietnam. He received a Signal Operations Instructions book that listed all the unused call signs. Most, like \"Bandit\", were more suitable for assault units than for medical evacuation units. But one entry, \"Dust Off\", epitomized the 57th's medical evacuation missions.

On 3 April 1964, First Lieutenant Brian Conway had the dubious distinction of being the first Medical Service Corp Aviator to be wounded in action in Vietnam. A .30-caliber round passed through his ankle as he terminated an approach into a field location for a patient pick-up. This wound resulted in Lt. Conway's evacuation to the United States.Other statistics which reflected an upward trend during the spring and early summer of 1964 were night flying time and missions. The evacuation of patients at night became routine. These missions were accomplished with a single helicopter flying blackout.

The VNAF response to requests for medical evacuation depended on aircraft availability, the security of the landing zone, and the mood and temperament of the VNAF pilots. If the South Vietnamese had no on-duty or standby aircraft ready to fly a medical evacuation mission, they passed the request on to the 57th.  Even when they accepted the mission themselves, their response usually suffered from a lack of leadership and poor organization. Since South Vietnamese air mission commanders rarely flew with their flights, the persons responsible for deciding whether to abort a mission often lacked the requisite experience.

Many times at night Dustoff pilots would have to make several flights into Can Tho. On return flights the pilots often found loads of injured ARVN soldiers lying on the landing pad where they had been left some hours earlier. After several such flights few pilots could sustain any enthusiasm for night missions.Another problem was that the ARVN officers sometimes bowed to the sentiments of their soldiers, many of whom believed that the soul lingers between this world and the next if the body is not properly buried.

On 1 March 1964 the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam ordered the aircraft at Pleiku and Qui Nhon to move to the Delta. Two helicopters and five pilots, now called Detachment A, 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, flew to the U.S. base at Soc Trang.

The rest of the 57th in Saigon struggled along with air conditioning, private baths, a mess hall, and a bar in their living quarters. In spite of the contrast, most pilots preferred Soc Trang. It was there that Major Kelly and his pilots forged the Dustoff tradition of valorous and dedicated service.Kelly and his teams also benefited from two years of growing American involvement in Vietnam.

For the first time since its arrival two years ago the 57th was receiving enough Dustoff requests to keep all its pilots busy.Kelly faced one big problem when he arrived: the helicopters that the 57th had received the year before were showing signs of age and use, and Brigadier General Joseph Stilwell Jr., the Support Group commander, could find no new aircraft for the detachment. Average flight time on the old UH-1Bs was 800 hours. But this did not deter the new pilots from each flying more than 100 hours a month in medical evacuations. Some of them stopped logging their flight time at 140 hours, so that the flight surgeon would not ground them for exceeding the monthly ceiling.The new team continued and even stepped-up night operations.

In March, this flying from outpost to outpost, known as \"scarfing\", resulted in seventy-four hours of night flying that evacuated nearly one-fourth of that month's 448 evacuees.

In previous years in Vietnam, commanders had utilized Dustoff aircraft in accordance with this Area Coverage concept. However, there was a case under consideration at the end of 1966 which challenged this concept as compared to direct individual unit coverage. The consequences of this problem area became increasingly important as more and more units arrived in South Vietnam. It would be impossible to provide every major commander with an individual Dustoff and still efficiently meet mission requirements in the country. In addition, it was felt that Dustoff operations had been highly successful in the past, and that the 57th could continue to provide a high caliber evacuation system in the future, provided evacuations continue to be administered through medical channels.Hoist Missions: The S7th Medical Detachment had equipment and trained personnel capable of performing hoist missions when required.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_83": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "However, problems had arisen in this area which deserve mention here.

Vehicle parts were harder to obtain, which often resulted in a low vehicle availability for the detachment.The two major problems that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment were again a result of the continuing de-escalation of the American forces in Vietnam.First, due to the dwindling number of missions, the newer pilots and enlisted crew members earned little flight time, thereby preventing them from becoming fully knowledgeable of an extremely large area of operations, as well as from becoming skilled in tactical flying and operations.Secondly, the aircraft direct support maintenance was contracted to a civilian organization, MHA Field Services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_110": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "As the 57th Medical Detachment had a low priority for direct support maintenance, aircraft which would normally be grounded for three or four days by military maintenance teams for periodic maintenance and inspections were delayed for as long as three weeks.

Inappropriate missions and the overclassification of patients remained continuing dilemmas. Redeployment, 1973.
