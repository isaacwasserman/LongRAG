Previous findings from the 2007 report highlight the effects on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise, and fisheries. These consequences are primarily based on temperature and precipitation predictions, with a projected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F every ten years. Visible environmental effects include glacier reduction, decreasing snowpack, earlier spring runoff, increased large wildfires, and rising sea levels affecting the Puget Sound area.\n\nThe 2007 report predicts a 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) temperature increase by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040, as well as a sea level rise of 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100. These changes will result in altered water flow volumes, impacting hydrological power output, municipal water supply, and fish migration. Overall, these shifts will negatively affect agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other sectors.\n\nA 2006 assessment, \"The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington's Economy,\" outlines three main conclusions: climate change impacts are visible, economic effects are becoming apparent, and the costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise. However, climate change also presents economic opportunities. Washington State's varied economy, valued at approximately $268.5 billion, is vulnerable to climate-related issues, with national and international trade and inter-sector links exacerbating the effects.\n\nGlobal warming threatens the natural habitats of three national parks in Washington State\u2014Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades\u2014by disrupting water flow and pathways.

A California study suggests a reduction in timber yields by up to 31% by the end of the 21st century. Climate change could introduce new pests to Washington forests, similar to the mountain pine beetle infestation in British Columbia.\n\nWashington State's heavy reliance on hydropower (72% of its power) makes it vulnerable to changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows.

This could negatively affect the state's finances, as it generates significant revenue from power sales, which are expected to decrease due to climate change. Additionally, increased temperatures in the summer months may affect the selling of electricity to other states, causing the state to lose money.\n\nThe municipal water supply, particularly in Seattle, is also at risk due to climate change. Experts predict a decrease in water supply by 2040, which could lead to water shortages for both humans and wildlife. The region's water supply comes from glaciers and mountain snowpack, which will be affected by rising temperatures, causing less water to be available during run-off seasons.\n\nFinally, the text mentions that Washington's forests could experience changes in tree growth and pest populations due to climate change, similar to the mountain pine beetle infestation in British Columbia.

The cost of these programs varies, with an average license or vessel buyback costing $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets, but reaching up to $10 million for larger factory trawlers. Since 1976, these programs have totaled $160 million nationally.\n\nIn the case of Lake Washington, rising temperatures have led to a decline in zooplankton populations, affecting juvenile salmon survival. Early algal blooms, caused by increased temperatures, reduce the food supply for Daphnia, a crucial zooplankton species, resulting in a more than 50% decrease in their numbers over the past 26 years. This, in turn, affects salmon populations, with rising temperatures playing a significant role in the disappearance of around half the sockeye salmon returning to the Cedar River watershed through the Ballard Locks and Lake Washington in 2004.\n\nThe loss of salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead, and other economically important fish due to increased temperatures may negatively impact local economies.

However, calculating the cost to protect shorelines is challenging due to variability in land quality, agricultural factors, and potential development for housing.
