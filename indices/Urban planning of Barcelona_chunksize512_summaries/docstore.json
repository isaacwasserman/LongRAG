The 1962 arterial network project planned radial highways and the construction of subway parking lots, while the Collserola mountain range tunnels were proposed, with only the Vallvidrera tunnel being built in two phases.

In 1967, Mercabarna, a central food market, was set up, and in 1993, the Zona d'Actividades Log\u00edsticas was created.

However, real estate speculation sparked discontent, leading to \"urban social movements\" that combined frustration over urban decay with political protests against the Franco regime. Examples include opposition to Lesseps square's new layout and the Partial Plan of Vallbona, Torre Bar\u00f3 and Trinitat.\n\nPlans for urban reorganization emerged, like the Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1966), aiming to balance profitability and construction, and the Plan Barcelona 2000 (1970), focusing on infrastructure and acknowledging the chaotic urban growth.
