However, Democrats blocked Youngkin's proposal to eliminate a local grocery tax and his goal of offering gas tax relief. The budget also featured a military pension tax exemption and a refundable earned income tax credit, the latter being a longtime Democratic priority.

Youngkin also failed to pass a proposal for public referendums on local real estate tax increases and vetoed a bill enhancing judges' ability to mandate landlord code compliance.\n\nDespite bipartisan support for the budget, some Democrats opposed the significant tax cuts, arguing that funds for affordable housing, mental health services, gun violence prevention, and transportation were insufficient. Youngkin has not announced plans for a grant to address inequities in the Virginia Employment Commission's operations and opposes further investments in affordable housing.\n\nEducation was a central theme in Youngkin's campaign, with a focus on cultural issues and curriculum.

No plans to eliminate advanced classes existed. Following this, Youngkin signed a bill allowing parents to review and opt their children out of material with \"sexually explicit content,\" a first in the nation. He also advocated for a bill to reverse admissions process reforms aimed at increasing racial diversity in some Governor's Schools, but it failed in the State Senate.

The tipline was compared to systems set up by previous governors for reporting business and health violations, but was widely criticized and mocked, with many, including educators and the media, predicting it would backfire. Despite multiple inquiries, the Youngkin administration did not disclose how complaints sent to the tipline would be used, and eventually closed it down in September 2022, citing a lack of tips. The administration also faced a lawsuit from over a dozen media outlets seeking access to the emails sent to the tipline.

However, this move was seen as an attempt to subvert the election results and was met with harsh partisan criticism. Youngkin also repealed protections for transgender students, replacing them with policies that require student-access to school facilities and programs to be determined by biological sex and mandate the use of legal documentation for name or gender changes.

He also aims to re-establish lab schools through partnerships with various institutions, allowing private businesses to participate, and changing public school funding for lab school students.

Youngkin signed legislation allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, and restored the requirement for principals to report certain misdemeanor crimes on school grounds. He also mandated digital floor plans for public schools and hazing prevention training for student organizations.
