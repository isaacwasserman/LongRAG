The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, with some shipments arriving directly from the port of Kronstadt, Russia.\n\nThe European livestock trade gradually declined by the late 1880s due to disease endemic in places like Prussia, where cattle smuggling was prevalent. The United States became the main supplier, with 3,144,400 American cattle landed at Deptford by 1913. American livestock exports to England were driven by a surplus that could not be absorbed by local demand.\n\nThe American West provided the surplus, with early Western cattle like Texas longhorns being replaced by higher-quality breeds through crossbreeding with Shorthorn and Hereford blood. This upgrading was a response to the demand for better cattle in the English export trade. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West.

They were shipped east on the Canadian Pacific Railway and initially considered disease-free, allowing for free landing at Deptford. However, from 1892 on, they were scheduled for slaughter at Deptford due to the movement of high-quality cattle to the British market.\n\nAs the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford's main supply of animals came from Argentina.

An alternative, American chilled meat, was already being imported into London in 1875 and was a commercial success. However, consumers were charged a premium for Deptford-killed American beef, possibly due to fraudulent reselling as Scotch or English beef. Chilled meat was considered as good as, if not better than, Deptford-killed beef by Plimsoll, as it was equivalent to well-hung meat. However, consumers' tastes, prejudices, and snobbery might have influenced their perception of chilled beef. Richard Perren suggested that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier, as consignments had to be sold promptly upon arrival, while there was less urgency with live beasts.

However, once cold storage was available at ports, chilled meat could be stored for an additional two weeks. Although the live animal trade was also risky, the chilled trade was larger.
