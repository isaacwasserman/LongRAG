To comply with FCC radio station ownership limits, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble acquired the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945. NBC hosted many popular performers and programs, including Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, and Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. However, in the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, leading to many NBC performers, including Jack Benny, jumping to CBS. NBC stars also began migrating to television, causing a decline in NBC's radio programming. In 1975, NBC launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), which provided up to 55 minutes of news per hour around the clock to local stations. However, it was discontinued in 1977 due to financial reasons. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a secondary network providing news and short features to FM rock stations. The NBC Radio Network was sold to Westwood One in 1987, which continued to feature \"NBC\"-branded programming until 2003, when NBC News Radio was launched, anchored by NBC and MSNBC talent.

Westwood One purchased Unistar Radio Networks from Infinity Broadcasting in 1994, and Infinity acquired 25 percent of Westwood One, becoming its largest shareholder and assuming control. Infinity was then acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5 billion in 1996, with the CBS Radio Network also falling under Westwood One management.

However, these efforts failed to draw the desired 18-34 demographic and alienated older viewers. In the 1970s, NBC entered a slump, with many of its new shows failing to attract viewers.

During this time, several longtime NBC affiliates defected to other networks, such as ABC and CBS, due to NBC's poor performance.
