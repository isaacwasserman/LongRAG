The Hells Angels' East Coast leader, John \"The Baptist\" LoFranco, reportedly declared war on the Pagans after this incident. In addition to conflicts with rival clubs, the Hells Angels have been involved in criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons possession, and violence. For example, in 2015, four Hells Angels members were indicted for possessing weapons and controlled dangerous substances. The club has also been linked to mafia organizations, specifically the Gambino and Genovese crime families, and has been accused of providing security and transportation in narcotics deals in exchange for drugs and contract killings. Furthermore, the Hells Angels have been associated with rape and sexual assault, as seen in the 1971 gang rape of a 17-year-old girl in New York City. The club has also been involved in assaults and murders, such as the 1975 shooting of a college student in Connecticut in retaliation for a car crash. The Hells Angels have also been criticized for their alleged involvement in the beating of a woman outside their clubhouse in Manhattan in 2007, although they deny any connection.
