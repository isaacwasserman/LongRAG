This influence can be seen throughout Picardo's career, particularly in his work on the Paradores.\n\nIn the 1950s, Picardo pursued personal architectural ambitions, entering competitions and publishing uncommissioned building plans. He collaborated with his brother on an apartment building near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas and built houses in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. He also received commissions for decorative mural paintings and illustrations in architectural textbooks.\n\nPicardo's skills as a draughtsman were highly regarded, with his quick sketches and detailed drawings recognized for their quality.

He preserved the original Mud\u00e9jar style of the buildings, using lime, clay, and wood in their reconstruction. The main hospitality section of the Parador was located in the Colegio de Infantes, while the Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodeled for kitchens, service areas, and staff residences.

Picardo decided to build the Parador on the site of the old barracks and stables, rather than in the castle itself, to take advantage of the views and avoid altering the castle's original structure. The first phase of the Parador, completed in 1965, included a dining room, lounge, service areas, and 7 double guest rooms, with additional rooms and facilities added in later phases.

The building was elevated to the title of Parador upon completion of this extension in 1978.\n\nPicardo designed the interior, creating furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, and floor and wall tile patterns to maintain the medieval atmosphere. He also incorporated coats of arms from demolished buildings and featured hand-painted written ceramic tiles by Juan Manuel Arroyo for decoration and credit.\n\nIn an architectural magazine article in 1967, Picardo expressed his satisfaction with the building's mood and aura, acknowledging his \"maestros\" (masters) who had not seen the finished project.

Despite discovering a deep crack and subsidence in the intended location for the Parador's southern wall, Picardo proceeded with the construction, stabilizing the ground with cement and a reinforced concrete slab.\n\nThe Parador, completed in 1971, featured a typical Hispanic-Arabic layout with two central patios, resembling the original fortress. The building, primarily on the southern and eastern walls, had four floors on the steeply sloping lower sections and two floors on the parade ground side.
