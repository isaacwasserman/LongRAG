Geology. Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three tectonic plates; the African Plate, Arabian Plate and Anatolian Plate. The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is represented by the Dead Sea Transform (DST)\u2014a major zone of left-lateral strike-slip fault\u2014it accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa. The northern end of the DST truncates at the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) another major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian Plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian Plate. The DST and EAF meet at the Marash Triple Junction. The EAF continues west of the triple junction, forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the Cyprus arc to the west via the Latakia Ridge.The 700 km-long (430 mi) EAF is subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast; the Karl\u0131ova, Il\u0131ca, Palu, P\u00fct\u00fcrge, Erkenek, Pazarc\u0131k and Amanos segments. The Amanos segment is also considered part of the DST by some geologists, or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others. A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognized, including the S\u00fcrg\u00fc, \u00c7ardak, Savrun, \u00c7okak, Toprakkale, Yumurtal\u0131k, Karata\u015f, Yakap\u0131nar and D\u00fczi\u00e7i\u2013\u0130skenderun segments. The estimated slip rate on the main strand of the EAF system decreases south-westwards from 10 mm (0.39 in) per year on the Karl\u0131ova segment down to 2.9 mm (0.11 in) per year on the Amanos segment. On the northern strand, a slip rate of 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per year was estimated on the \u00c7ardak segment. The S\u00fcrg\u00fc-\u00c7ardak Fault is an east-west striking 160 km (99 mi) long fault that runs north of the EAF. Comprising two segments; the S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault runs 70 km (43 mi) between \u00c7elikhan and Nurhak; the \u00c7ardak Fault runs 90 km (56 mi) between Nurhak and G\u00f6ksun. Seismicity on the fault is low\u2014the only associated earthquake was a M 6.8 event in 1544.The northern part of the DST is subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between scientists as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure. Following the 2013 \"Active Fault Map of Turkey\", seven DST segments are recognized in Turkey and neighbouring parts of Syria; the Afrin, Sermada, Armanaz, Hac\u0131pa\u015fa, Yesemek, Sak\u00e7ag\u00f6z and Narl\u0131 segments. Seismicity. The EAF has produced large or damaging earthquakes in the past few hundred years along various segments, including the 1789 (M 7.2, Palu), 1795 (M 7.0, Pazarc\u0131k), 1866 (M 7.2 Karl\u0131ova), 1872 (M 7.2, Amanos), 1874 (M 7.1, Palu), 1875 (M 6.7, Palu), 1893 (M 7.1, Erkenek), 1971 (M6.6, Karl\u0131ova) and 2020 (Mw\u202f6.8, P\u00fct\u00fcrge) events. Other large historical earthquakes have been tentatively assigned to segments of the EAF, such as the 1114 and 1513 Marash earthquakes, both thought to have ruptured the Pazarc\u0131k segment.The Palu and P\u00fct\u00fcrge segments in the east display a recurrence interval of about 150 years for M 6.8\u20137.0 earthquakes. The Pazarc\u0131k and Amanos segments in the west have recurrence intervals of 237\u2013772 years and 414\u2013917 years, respectively, for M 7.0\u20137.4 earthquakes. A research paper published by Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2002 studied stress accumulation and increased seismic hazard along the East Anatolian Fault. The study concluded two sections of the fault with considerably high potential for future earthquakes. One of these sections was in Elaz\u0131\u011f and Bing\u00f6l, located between the rupture zones of the 1874 and 1971 earthquakes.

Earthquake sequence. The first and largest earthquake in the sequence struck at 01:17 UTC. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) measured it at Mww\u202f7.8 and Mw\u202f7.8, respectively. GEOSCOPE reported Mw\u202f8.0 and Kandilli Observatory (KOERI) reported Mw\u202f7.7 and ML\u202f7.4. It had an epicenter at 37.166\u00b0N 37.032\u00b0E\ufeff / 37.166; 37.032, 34 km (21 mi) west of Gaziantep in Gaziantep Province, which is near the border with Syria. The earthquake hypocenter was at a depth of 10.0 km (6 mi) according to USGS and 5 km (3 mi) according to KOERI. The shock had a focal mechanism corresponding to strike-slip faulting.It is one of the strongest ever recorded in Turkey, equivalent in magnitude to the 1939 Erzincan earthquake (Mw\u202f7.8). These earthquakes are surpassed only by the larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake. Globally it was the strongest recorded since August 2021. Both earthquakes are the largest and only observed to occur on land and within a short span of time. At 10:24 UTC, an earthquake measuring Mww\u202f7.5 according to USGS, Mw\u202f7.6 according to KOERI, or Mw\u202f7.7 according to Geoscope and the GCMT, struck with an epicenter near Ekin\u00f6z\u00fc, 95 km northeast of the M7.8 event. It had a depth of 7.4 km (5 mi) according to the USGS, 5 km (3 mi) by KOERI, and 13 km (8 mi) by Geoscope.A reevaluation of the earthquakes using long-period coda moment magnitude obtained moment magnitudes of Mw\u202f 7.95 \u00b1 0.013 and Mw\u202f 7.86 \u00b1 0.012, respectively. These earthquakes were the largest Turkish earthquakes in over 2,000 years. Aftershocks. Over 570 aftershocks were recorded within 24 hours of the Mw\u202f7.8 earthquake and over 30,000 recorded by May 2023. An aftershock measuring Mww\u202f6.7 occurred about 11 minutes after the mainshock. There were 25 aftershocks Mw\u202f4.0 or greater recorded within six hours of the main tremor, according to the USGS. More than 12 hours later, the USGS had reported at least 54 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude, while the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) recorded at least 120 total aftershocks. A Mww\u202f6.3 aftershock struck near Uzunba\u011f in Hatay Province on 20 February; the earthquake was the result of oblique-normal faulting. The Mw\u202f 7.8 earthquake had aftershocks distributed along ~350 km (220 mi) of the EAF.The Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two mb 6.0 aftershocks.

Aftershocks of the second earthquake continued through at least 9 Feb. Thousands of aftershocks associated with this earthquake were distributed along an east-west trend corresponding to the \u00c7ardak Fault for about 170 km (110 mi). Seismology. A source model for the Mww\u202f7.8 earthquake produced by the USGS from observed seismic waves, taking into account preliminary rupture mapping from satellite data, uses three fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >40 km (25 mi) \u00d7 30 km (19 mi), 028\u00b0/85\u00b0 (Segment 1), >175 km (109 mi) \u00d7 30 km (19 mi), 060\u00b0/85\u00b0 (Segment 2) and >160 km (99 mi) \u00d7 20 km (12 mi), 025\u00b0/75\u00b0 (Segment 3). The mainshock produced a maximum slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2, beneath Sakarya in Kahramanmara\u015f Province, northeast of the junction where it meets Segment 1. Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Ad\u0131yaman.The USGS source model for the Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70 km (43 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 276\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 1), >40 km (25 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 250\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 2) and ~80 km (50 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 060\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4 m (37 ft).Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw\u202f 7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarc\u0131k and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370 km (230 mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of 9 m (30 ft) along the Pazarc\u0131k segment. The northern end of the rupture was about 20\u201330 km (12\u201319 mi) south of the Mw\u202f 6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the P\u00fct\u00fcrge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12 m (39 ft) from the surface to 7 km (4.3 mi) depth during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake; slip was 11 m (36 ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact\u2014mostly confined to within the \u00c7ardak Fault; it was also shallower\u2014attenuating from 8\u201312 km (5.0\u20137.5 mi). Slip during the Mw\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw\u202f 7.7 event. The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25 km (16 mi) \u00d7 25 km (16 mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth.Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that is was already close to failure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_3": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Slip during the Mw\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw\u202f 7.7 event.

Stress on the Hatay Fault, source of the 20 February Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock, increased by 1 bar following the 6 February earthquakes. Rupture propagation. Preliminary analysis based on seismology and observations of surface rupture suggest the following sequence of events: initial rupture at the site of the epicenter of the M7.8 shock on the Narl\u0131 Fault, the northernmost section of the Dead Sea Transform. The fault ruptured unilaterally northwards until it reached the Pazarc\u0131k segment of the East Anatolian Fault. Ruptures then continued bilaterally to the northeast and southwest along this segment. This subevent on the Narl\u0131 Fault corresponded to a Mw\u202f 7.0 earthquake which ruptured for 20 seconds. It had a focal mechanism corresponding to oblique-normal faulting. A preliminary analysis of near-field (within 1 km (0.62 mi) of the fault rupture) seismic records indicates that the initial rupture speed transitioned to supershear after propagating about 19.5 km (12.1 mi) away from the epicenter along the Narl\u0131 Fault before it reached the EAF. Back projection suggest the total rupture length was ~560 km (350 mi).The rupture continued northeast onto the Ekernek segment and to the southwest onto the Amanos segment. The northeastern rupture ceased 55 seconds after initiation while the southwestern rupture ceased near Antakya about 80 seconds later. A Mw\u202f6.8 aftershock occurring 11 minutes later and west of the first M>7 epicenter may have ruptured along the Sak\u00e7ag\u00f6z Fault, the next segment of the Dead Sea Transform to the south. Rupture along the EAF during the event occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 3.2 km (2.0 mi) per second). An analysis of near-field seismic data revealed transient supershear rupture episodes throughout the EAF rupture. Supershear rupture occurred along the northernmost section of the Narl\u0131 Fault where it meets the EAF. The rupture transitioned onto the EAF and propagated northeast at supershear velocity until its termination near Malatya. Rupture towards the southwest was mostly subshear, but at the southern termination in Hatay, where the fault has multiple branches and kinks, supershear was likely observed. Supershear rupture at the southern termination contributed to the intense ground motion in Antakya.The second M>7 earthquake initiated on a separate fault known as the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault Zone, part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault. The rupture propagated bilaterally along the \u00c7ardak segment, continuing eastwards onto the S\u00fcrg\u00fc segment before continuing eastwards to Malatya along the northeast\u2013southwest trending Do\u011fan\u015fehir Fault Zone. Rupture also propagated towards the southwest along the \u00c7ardak segment. The total rupture length was estimated at 160 km (99 mi). The westward-propagating rupture occurred at supershear velocity (maximum 4.8 km (3.0 mi) per second) while the eastward-propagating rupture occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 2.8 km (1.7 mi) per second). The rupture lasted about 35 seconds.The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock on 20 February occurred along the Hatay Fault. The focal mechanism indicated normal faulting along a northeast-southwest striking fault. Surface rupture.

The extent of surface ruptures associated with the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes have been mapped using a mixture of satellite imagery and ground observations. Pixel matching on images captured by Sentinel-1 before and after the earthquakes showed sharp discontinuities in displacement, revealing two separate zones of surface rupture. The longer of the pair, produced by the first earthquake, measured 320 km (200 mi) while the second earthquake produced 150 km (93 mi) of surface rupture. These observations were backed up with direct imaging of the ruptures using other satellite data, such as from the DigitalGlobe's WorldView-1, 2 & 3 and GeoEye-1, and by field work. Remote sensing using satellite imagery indicated 30 km (19 mi) of surface rupture with large normal faulting component.. The zone of surface rupture extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarc\u0131k, Kahramanmara\u015f Province and G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province. Surface ruptures continued north of these cities. Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley. The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation. A major canal was damaged and lead to flooding in parts of the Amik Valley which was formerly Lake Amik. Field observations indicate a maximum displacement of 7.3 m (24 ft) on the surface. Geologists traced a 15 km (9.3 mi) surface rupture trending south from Pazarc\u0131k with an offset of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). From Golbasi to Nurda\u011f\u0131 ground displacements were up to 5 m (16 ft). The surface rupture observed during the M7.8 earthquake was unusually large, comparable to that during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake along the San Andreas Fault.Large surface offsets of 6\u20138 m (20\u201326 ft) were observed along the S\u00fcrg\u00fc-\u00c7ardak Fault. The largest offset was measured along a road west of G\u00f6zp\u0131nar; the rupture displaced the road left-laterally for 8.6 m (28 ft). Ground motion. Ground acceleration values recorded in some areas near the fault rupture were in excess of 1 g. Three USGS seismic installations, two at Antakya and one at Hassa, recorded large ground accelerations and velocities. The town of Hassa recorded 0.9082 g in ground acceleration (pga) and 215.34 cm/s (84.78 in/s) in ground velocity. The station data corresponded to a Modified Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). A peak ground acceleration of 1.62 g was recorded by a station at Fevzipa\u015fa. The peak ground acceleration generally exceeded 0.5 g in a large area around the epicenter, near Adiyaman and a large part of Hatay. High pga values of 2 g were recorded in Hatay. The maximum recorded pga was 2.212 g at a station in Pazarc\u0131k Belediyesi Park\u0131, Pazarc\u0131k; a government health facility nearby had sparce damage but the surrounding town was devastated. The maximum recorded pga during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake was 0.59 g at G\u00f6ksun.According to Kandilli Observatory, the maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of the mainshock was estimated to have reached MMI XI\u2013XII (Extreme) in Antakya and near the epicenter. MMI XI (Extreme) or higher was observed along the fault rupture from the epicenter to Antakya. The MMI also reached IX\u2013X (Violent\u2013Extreme) in Kahramanmara\u015f and \u0130skenderun, VIII\u2013IX (Severe\u2013Violent) in Malatya and Ad\u0131yaman, VII\u2013VIII (Very strong\u2013Severe) in Gaziantep, Kilis, Idlib and Aleppo, and VI\u2013VII (Strong\u2013Very strong) in Adana and \u015eanl\u0131urfa.

The maximum MMI of the second earthquake was X (Extreme). Geological effects. Liquefaction was identified via satellite and remote sensing along the southern portion of the Mw\u202f7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments. These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.  Liquefaction was also observed in Samanda\u011f. At Lake G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province, lateral spreading occurred along the northern, eastern and southern coast. Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged. G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.. Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in \u0130skenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atat\u00fcrk Boulevard in \u00c7ay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure. The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200 m (660 ft). Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at \u0130skenderun.Despite an epicenter 90 km (56 mi) inland, a tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea. Small tsunami waves were recorded off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, without damage. The tsunami measured 0.17 m (6.7 in), and tsunami waves were recorded at 0.12 m (4.7 in) at \u0130skenderun and 0.13 m (5.1 in) at Erdemli. Tsunami warnings were issued for the southern Turkish coast, southern and eastern Italian coasts and the whole eastern Mediterranean Sea area, but later withdrawn. Damage and casualties. In Turkey. There were 50,783 deaths, 297 missing and 107,204 injured across 11 of the 17 affected provinces of Turkey. At least 15.73 million people and 4 million buildings were affected. About 345,000 apartments were destroyed. More than 2 million residents in the affected provinces were evacuated to nearby provinces including Mersin, Antalya, Mardin, Ni\u011fde and Konya. More than 20 percent of Turkey's agriculture production was affected. The United Nations said crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and rural infrastructure were heavily damaged. At least 516 university buildings were affected, of which 106 were heavily damaged.By 23 February 2023, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change conducted damage inspections for 1.25 million buildings; revealing 164,000 buildings were either destroyed or severely damaged. A further 150,000 commercial infrastructure were at least moderately damaged. The International Organization for Migration estimated over 2.7 million people were made homeless. A damage assessment by the Turkish government revealed at least 61,722 buildings had to be demolished including 11,900 in Gaziantep Province, 10,900 in Hatay Province, 10,800 in Kahramanmara\u015f Province and 28,914 in Malatya Province. Broad fissures appeared on roads. During recovery efforts, body parts were often found in the rubble..

On 14 February, the Syrian government agreed to open the border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Ra\u00e9e for three months.President al-Assad met UN relief chief Martin Griffiths met on 21 March to discuss post-earthquake recovery and aid. International humanitarian efforts. Countries. Arab League. Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit called for international assistance to help those affected by \"this humanitarian catastrophe\". ASEAN. The Secretariat of ASEAN expressed its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the Governments and peoples of the affected countries, especially the families of the victims of the earthquake. ASEAN affirms its solidarity with the Governments and peoples of Turkiye and Syria in these trying times and stands ready to extend its assistance to the relief efforts. European Union (EU). The European Union's European Civil Protection Mechanism, in which Turkey participates despite not being a member of the EU, was activated at the request of Turkey. The EU dispatched thirty-one rescue teams and five medical teams from 23 member states to Turkey, committed \u20ac3 million and \u20ac3.5 million to Turkey and Syria respectively, and announced a donor conference to raise money. The Copernicus Programme was also activated to provide emergency mapping services and other help. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that member countries were mobilizing support. The Strategic Airlift Capability was used to transport search and rescue equipment. NATO deployed \"fully equipped semi-permanent shelter facilities\" to house displaced persons in Turkey. Flags at NATO headquarters were also lowered to half-mast. A vessel carrying the first 600 of 1,000 containers for temporary housing left Taranto, Italy for Turkey to accommodate at least 4,000 people. United Nations (UN). Several United Nations agencies announced coordinated responses to the disaster, including UNDAC, OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM. The World Health Organization's Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said the organization's regional offices were assisting international efforts to transport medicine and relief equipment. The UN released $25 million from its emergency fund for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria. A second $25 million grant was released for relief efforts in Syria. UN sent humanitarian aid to Syria through Turkey via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. On 14 February, the UN appealed for \u20ac396 million to help survivors in Syria. World Bank. The World Bank said it would provide US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey to support the relief and recovery process. \"We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground,\" said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\u202f7. However, professor Hasan S\u00f6zbilir, Director of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\u202f6.7.

Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\". Erdo\u011fan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuo\u011flu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdo\u011fan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmara\u015f, were used to dispute Erdo\u011fan's claim.In Ad\u0131yaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailo\u011flu, and governor, Mahmut \u00c7uhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdo\u011fan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdo\u011fan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdo\u011fan said \"We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,\" In another video, he said \"We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,\"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Ad\u0131yaman; 14,719 in Diyarbak\u0131r; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmara\u015f; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. After a destructive earthquake struck \u0130zmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in \u0130zmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdo\u011fan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_20": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "After a destructive earthquake struck \u0130zmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018.

He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; \u00a33.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. \u0130smail Palako\u011flu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbak\u0131r Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".A week after the earthquakes in Samanda\u011f, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary \"because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes,\" The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_21": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".A week after the earthquakes in Samanda\u011f, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake.

The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\" Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey's opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1, and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council. In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ's statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over \"provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic\" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozda\u011f, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozda\u011f said: \"Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary\". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the \"Earthquake Crimes Investigation\" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for \"spreading misinformation\" or for \"\"provoking the people into animosity and hatred\" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozda\u011f said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed.

A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. The owner of a construction company which built several buildings in Adana was apprehended in Northern Cyprus.The majority of buildings that collapsed in Turkey were constructed before 2000, but some were constructed after that year. Following the 1999 earthquake, building construction followed new regulations and had improved materials. Sukru Ersoy, a geology professor at Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University, said \"corruption is high in the construction sector in Turkey. And therefore, there were abuses\". However, corruption was not always present in local authorities; in Erzin, which has a strict policy against the construction of buildings that violated safety codes in addition to having endured other earthquakes with less damage, became a popular location for survivors elsewhere to take refuge as no collapsed buildings were reported. National mourning. President Erdo\u011fan declared seven days of national mourning in Turkey on Twitter. Seven days of national mourning was observed in Northern Cyprus, and one day in Bangladesh and Kosovo. Albania's prime minister, Edi Rama, said 13 February would be a day of national mourning. On 13 February, all overseas diplomatic missions of North Macedonia lowered the North Macedonian flags to half-mast. Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition. Investigative reports revealed that Syrian government had deliberately obstructed aid to all of Syria's opposition-held areas, including the Idlib region, which was the worst-struck area in the earthquake. Syrian government officials and state-run media blamed United States and European Union sanctions against the country for the lack of humanitarian aid and hampering rescue. On 10 February, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad accused Western countries of having \"no regard for the human condition.\" The US Treasury said its sanctions \"contain robust exemptions for humanitarian efforts\" in the first place, and that after the earthquake it issued a blanket authorization for relief efforts. The United Nations has also been criticized for its policy of focusing aid shipments solely to the regime, at the expense of Syrian lives in opposition-held territories.Idlib region, under the control of Syrian Salvation Government (SSG), was one of the hardest-hit territories. Assad regime's policy of besieging North-West Syria; which blockades the supply of food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies, has further deteriorated the crisis in Idlib. Abu Muhammad Al-Julani, commander of the SSG-aligned Tahrir al-Sham rebel militia, criticized aid agencies of neglecting the situation in Idlib and called on the international community to be more proactive in reconstruction and relief efforts, adding that the \"United Nations needs to understand that it's required to help in a crisis\". Upon traveling to the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing bordering the rebel-held territories, UNOCHA Under-Secretary Martin Griffith stated on 12 February that \"We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria\". As of 13 February, Ankara and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army were accused of blocking aid convoys sent by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria from entering the north-west region.The United Nations criticized Russia's attempts to block delivery of aid through checkpoints to rebel-held territories. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged the Security Council to immediately permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria. United States appealed for the immediate opening of all closed checkpoints to send in relief efforts to all parts of Syria; calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to increase humanitarian assistance through Bab al-Hawa and open up more border crossings for the entry of UN aid. St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesperson, said on 14 February, \"some aid is getting into the north-west, pointing to 58 trucks that arrived with aid through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing.\" However, the organization does not possess heavy equipment or search and rescue teams. He stressed that the \"international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_23": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged the Security Council to immediately permit aid flows into Northwestern Syria.

He stressed that the \"international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it is needed.\". Raed al-Saleh, chief of Syrian Civil Defence, strongly rebuked the UN for its negligence and delay in responding to the rescue efforts:\"Let me be clear: The White Helmets received no support from the United Nations during the most critical moments of the rescue operations.. The UN's failure to respond quickly to this catastrophe is shameful. When I asked the UN why help had failed to arrive in time, the answer I received was bureaucracy. In the face of one of the deadliest catastrophes to strike the world in years, it seems the UN's hands were tied by red tape.\" Health concerns. Due to below-freezing temperatures in the affected areas in both Turkey and Syria, the mayor of Hatay, L\u00fctf\u00fc Sava\u015f, warned about the hypothermia risk. In Adiyaman Province, some residents trapped under rubble died from hypothermia.Concerns arose regarding the possible spread of infection in areas where sanitation facilities were damaged or unfunctional. Due to water shortage experienced in both countries, many survivors could not shower. International health organizations said the shortage of clean water would be a public health risk. The World Health Organization said water shortage \"increases the risk of waterborne diseases and outbreaks of communicable diseases.\"On 18 February, Turkey's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said there was an increase in intestinal and upper respiratory infection cases but \"numbers did not pose a serious threat to public health.\" At a stadium serving as shelter in Kahramanmara\u015f, a clinic managed by 15 to 30 medics attended up to 10,000 patients in the day.
