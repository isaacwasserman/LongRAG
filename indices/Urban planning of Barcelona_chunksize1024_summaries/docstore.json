The event also spurred the improvement of public spaces, transportation, and communication throughout the city, including the construction of the Prat Airport, the renovation of the France Station, and the elimination of level crossings. These advancements resulted in increased immigration, leading to the development of working-class neighborhoods and, unfortunately, the rise of shanty towns. Additionally, the first traffic lights were installed in 1929, with the first synchronization taking place in 1958.

The Regional Plan of 1953 aimed to improve the urban environment, housing, and transportation, but faced challenges in implementation.\n\nInfrastructure projects, like the partial construction of three tunnels through Collserola mountain range and the expansion of the metro network, were carried out. Barcelona hosted the XXXV International Eucharistic Congress in 1952, leading to the development of the Congreso neighborhood. The 1958 Social Urgency Plan addressed the housing deficit with large social housing blocks in peripheral neighborhoods.\n\nThe Zona Franca, initially planned as a free trade zone in 1900, was eventually established in the 1960s as an industrial estate.

Despite attempts at urban reorganization, like the Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (1966) and Plan Barcelona 2000 (1970), many projects were not realized, including a Universal Exposition in 1982 and the Plan de la Ribera (1964-1972).

This period saw a surge in public facilities, including schools, parks, gardens, roads, and civic, cultural, and sports centers. The city's urban landscape changed significantly due to strong public investment, which was facilitated by the relocation of factories and industrial complexes.\n\nUrban planning during this time prioritized reconstruction over expansion and public initiatives over private ones. The city was viewed as a collection of distinct realities, with each public space intervention aiming to regenerate underprivileged areas and compensate for quantitative and qualitative shortcomings.\n\nIndustrial restructuring, driven by the Plan for the reindustrialization of Barcelona's center, resulted in the creation of a Zona d'Urgent Reindustrialitzaci\u00f3 (Urgent Reindustrialization Zone) (ZUR). The new industrial development emphasized R&D and new technologies.\n\nThe General Metropolitan Urban Development Plan (1976), drafted by Joan Antoni Solans, aimed to curb speculation and rehabilitate the most degraded urban spaces. The Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona was established, which included Barcelona and 26 surrounding municipalities. The plan outlined three main action lines: small-scale urban rehabilitation, urban restructuring, and morphological reorganization. However, the project was never fully implemented due to numerous lawsuits and claims, resulting in its dissolution in 1985.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1989, the concept of \"areas of new centrality\" was developed to create a more polycentric and better-connected city.
