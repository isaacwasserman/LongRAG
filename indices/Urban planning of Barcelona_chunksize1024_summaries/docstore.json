cohesive; and establishing the methods and tools necessary to carry it out.\n- In 2016, a pilot test was initiated for the adaptation of certain sets of city blocks as \"superblocks\", with restricted vehicle traffic to enhance pedestrian traffic, bicycle circulation and public transport.\n- The first superblock was created in Poblenou, with vertical and horizontal signs changed to mark the area, prohibiting straight-line traffic and limiting vehicle speed to 10 km/h.\n- In 2020, the creation of 42 new green axes and squares began in the Eixample district, with the first axis of action being Consell de Cent street, where the creation of four new agoras is planned.\n- Private traffic will be restricted to residents, with a maximum speed of 10 km/h, and a budget of 37.8 million euros is foreseen for these actions.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic led to various urban planning changes in the city, including the setting aside of spaces for pedestrians and the creation of terraces for bars and restaurants.\n- Many of these temporary changes became permanent, such as the spaces enabled for terraces of hospitality establishments, which were regulated in September 2021 by a new ordinance.\n\nNote: The information in this summary is based on the passage provided and has been written in bullet point format for easy reference.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,
