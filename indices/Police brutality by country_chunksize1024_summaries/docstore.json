However, Rio de Janeiro's police faced challenges adapting to the new guidelines and were accused of non-compliance. The STF decision also influenced other countries, such as Colombia, where protests against police brutality took place following the death of Javier Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in police custody, and Chile, where the Carabineros de Chile faced investigations for power abuse and police brutality, particularly towards students and the Mapuche people.
