The state is expected to experience a temperature rise of 0.5 \u00b0F every ten years, leading to increased wildfires, reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and rising sea levels. These changes will have significant economic and ecological consequences, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, dairy farming, wine industry, electricity, and water supply. A 2007 report, \"The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State,\" outlines specific predictions, including a 2 \u00b0F temperature rise by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F by 2040, and a sea level rise of 0.91 m by 2100. The report also highlights the potential economic opportunities presented by climate change. A 2006 study, \"The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy,\" emphasizes the unique vulnerabilities and opportunities for Washington's economy in the face of climate change. The state's natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade significantly influence these impacts. Climate change can affect various aspects of the economy, including resource availability, quality of resources, capital assets, and human health. National parks in Washington State, such as Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades, are at risk of habitat disruption due to glacier melting and shifts in water flow. Forestlands, which make up a significant portion of Washington's economy, could also be impacted by changes in tree growth rates and pest ranges. Electricity supply and demand will be affected by temperature changes, peak snowpack melt, and stream flow, potentially leading to increased costs for consumers.

This decline in water supply will impact agriculture, municipal water systems, and wildlife.
