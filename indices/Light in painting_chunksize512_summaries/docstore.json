These techniques significantly impacted Greek, early Christian, Byzantine, and even Indian art.\n\nIn practice, artists would paint hollow subjects like wells or caves in black or brown to create the illusion of depth, while applying black around prominent features like a girl's breasts or a horse's legs to make them appear more forward. This effect was known empirically by ancient painters and was appreciated by critics like Cicero and Pseudo-Longinus.\n\nThe use of chiaroscuro was particularly popular in Hellenistic art, especially in landscape painting, and was later adopted in Roman painting, as seen in the illusory architectures of the frescoes of Pompeii. However, this technique disappeared during the Middle Ages. In Paleochristian art, there was a resurgence of contrasts between light and shadow, which has been referred to as \"ancient impressionism.\"\n\nByzantine art inherited the use of illusionistic light effects from Pompeian art, but its primary function shifted from naturalistic representation to a rhetorical formula.

They created landscape paintings with serene, spiritually significant light, reflecting a love for the pristine, divine nature of the United States. Their light treatment was original due to subtle tonality variations, achieved through meticulous study of their natural environment.\n\nIn the context of American Luminism, the text describes a transcendent light of spiritual significance, characterized by subtle tonality variations and achieved through careful study of the natural environment. Luminism is considered a more serene form of the romantic aesthetic concept of the sublime, which is translated in the deep expanses of the North American landscape. Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting. Pure Luminism, primarily in the New England area, features peaceful, anecdotal landscapes with delicate tonal gradations, crystalline light, and idealized nature. Meanwhile, Hudson River School landscape painting has a more cosmic vision and a preference for wilder and grandiloquent nature with dramatic visual effects.\n\nThomas Cole, an English artist who settled in New York, is considered the pioneer of the Hudson River School. He aimed to achieve an elevated style of landscape with a moral message equivalent to history painting. Cole painted both landscapes of the Hudson River area and biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component. Durand, a little older than Cole, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time after Cole's premature death.

Claus used Impressionist techniques and studied light effects in various atmospheric conditions, while Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, Whistler, Baroque painter Frans Hals, and Spanish painting, with a loose and vigorous brushwork style.\n\nA luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, linked to incipient Fauvism, with artists like Toorop, Gestel, Sluyters, and early Mondrian. Toorop combined various styles in his search for a unique language, focusing on allegorical and symbolic themes.\n\nIn Germany, Max Liebermann evolved from realism and slight impressionist influence to a personal luminism, characterized by violent brushstrokes and brilliant light.\n\nSpanish luminism developed mainly in Valencia and Catalonia, with Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla as the main representative of the Valencian school.

His early works, such as \"La vuelta de la pesca\" (1895), exhibit a particular interest in the study of light, especially its reflection on water and sails.\n\nA turning point in his career came during his visit to the 1900 Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was captivated by the intense chromaticism and luminosity of Nordic artists. This encounter led Sorolla to intensify his coloring and luminosity, resulting in a series of bright, warm seascapes bathed in Mediterranean light, such as \"J\u00e1vea\" (1900), \"Idilio\" (1900), and \"Playa de Valencia\" (1902).\n\nFrom 1906 onwards, Sorolla's palette became more subdued, with a preference for mauve tones and a decrease in luminosity. He continued to produce seascapes, but expanded his repertoire to include other landscapes, gardens, and portraits.

His later works, like \"La bata rosa\" (1916), have an abundance of light and blurred contours.\n\nThe Sitges School, active in Catalonia from 1878 to 1892, was characterized by its use of vibrant Mediterranean light and atmospheric effects. Its members, including Arcadi Mas i Fondevila and Joaquim de Mir\u00f3, were heirs to Fortuny and sought to reflect luminous effects in harmonious compositions. The Sitges School is considered a precursor to Catalan modernism, with artists like Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol adopting plein air painting and focusing on the luminosity of their surroundings.

In the same period, American artists developed figurative movements focusing on everyday reality and urban life, with an emphasis on artificial lights. The Ashcan School, led by Robert Henri, used a dark palette to depict marginalization and nightlife, followed by American realism, represented by Edward Hopper. Hopper was known for his expressive use of light in urban scenes with anonymous characters, often using contrasting cold colors and unusual perspectives.

Pollock used glitter and aluminum enamel to create a metallic light, while Rothko layered fluid paint to produce glazes and transparencies, focusing on color harmony.\n\nEuropean informalism encompassed various styles, including tachism, art brut, and matter painting. Artists like Georges Mathieu, Hans Hartung, Jean Fautrier, Jean Dubuffet, Lucio Fontana, and Antoni T\u00e0pies gained recognition for their innovative approaches. T\u00e0pies, in particular, used a mixed technique with crushed marble powder and pigments, creating a distinctive style.\n\nOp-art, or optical art, emerged with an emphasis on visual effects, often achieved through optical illusions, movement, or light. Victor Vasarely, Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto, and Yaacov Agam were prominent op-art artists who explored various techniques and materials to manipulate light and space.

Vasarely's works, such as Eridan (1956), featured contrasts between light and shadow, while his Cappella series (1964) combined light opposition with shapes. The Vega series (1967) utilized aluminum paint and gold/silver glitter to reflect light. Soto's serial painting, influenced by dodecaphonism, showcased primary colors with transparency and movement. Agam focused on chromatic combinations, working with 150 colors in painting or sculpture-painting.\n\nPop art, a figurative trend from 1955-1970, rejected abstract expressionism and returned to figuration with popular inspiration from advertising, photography, comics, and mass media. Notable artists include Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Rosenquist, and Warhol. Lichtenstein drew inspiration from comics, using flat inks and pure colors. Wesselmann focused on nudes in bathrooms with cold, aseptic appearances and sharp contrasts. Rosenquist had a surrealist approach with consumerist and advertising themes. Warhol, the most commercial artist of the group, worked in silkscreen with series featuring famous people and everyday objects in garish, strident colorism and an impersonal technique.\n\nAbstract art resurfaced between the 1960s and 1980s with Post-painterly abstraction and Minimalism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_130": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "During the 1960s-1980s, abstract art re-emerged with Post-painterly abstraction and Minimalism.

Notable artists include Barnett Newman, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, and Kenneth Noland. Minimalism, leading to conceptual art, featured simple works, reduced to basic motifs with refined techniques, like Robert Mangold and Robert Ryman. Alongside this, hyperrealism emerged around 1965, characterized by a heightened, exaggerated representation of reality with meticulous detail, as seen in artists like Chuck Close, Richard Estes, Don Eddy, John Salt, and Ralph Goings, as well as the Spanish painter Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_131": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_131", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "During the 1960s-1980s, artists like Chuck Close, Richard Estes, Don Eddy, John Salt, and Ralph Goings, as well as Spanish painter Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda, focused on hyperrealism, meticulously depicting intricate details such as car glitter, shop window reflections, and urban light effects, often with a dreamlike touch reminiscent of magical realism. Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda's work is notable for its precise reality descriptions and atmospheric compositions, as seen in \"Madrid sur\" (1965-1985) and \"Madrid desde Torres Blancas\" (1976-1982). Neo-luminism, an American movement inspired by American luminism and the Hudson River School, focused on capturing subtle light gradations in majestic skies and calm water marinas, with artists like James Doolin, April Gornik, Norman Lundin, Scott Cameron, Steven DaLuz, and Pauline Ziegen.\n\nFrom 1975 onwards, postmodern art became prominent in the international art scene, characterized by self-referential works that emphasize art's intrinsic value rather than social commentary.
