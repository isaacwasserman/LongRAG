The St. Lawrence River route allowed Canadian cattle to begin their journey in calm and cool waters, but many losses occurred during the initial days due to delays and neglect. Initially, Canadian livestock was considered disease-free and could be easily exported to Britain, where they were slaughtered at Deptford. However, this changed in 1892 when Canadian cattle were scheduled for slaughter at Deptford due to their wild nature. Despite this, exports to England continued to rise, reaching 160,000 cattle in 1905. However, a severe winter depleted the range-cattle industry's working capital, causing exports to decline. As the North American surplus dwindled, Argentina became the primary supplier of cattle to Deptford, providing animals of a higher quality than before.\n\nIn summary, the British market's demand for livestock had a substantial impact on the North American and Argentine livestock industry, influencing the transportation, slaughter, and breeding of cattle during this period.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_29": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Argentine cattle industry underwent significant changes, transforming it into the world's leading exporter.
