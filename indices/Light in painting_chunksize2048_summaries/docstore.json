Shadows form when light is obstructed and can be of shape or projection. The reflection of light creates various phenomena such as glints, glares, color reflections, and image reflections.

A shadow's illumination can come from a secondary source, called \"fill light\", and its color can range from blue to black, depending on factors like light contrast, transparency, and translucency. Shadows from natural light have parallel beams and adapt to terrain and obstacles, while artificial light has divergent beams and less defined limits, resulting in combined shadows.\n\nLight reflection creates four phenomena: glints (reflections of the light source), glares (reflections from illuminated bodies), color reflections (from the proximity of objects), and image reflections (from polished surfaces). Transparency occurs in non-opaque bodies, resulting in filtered light, which can also be produced through certain materials or foliage.\n\nIn painting, light can be intrinsic or extrinsic, with various directions and distributions. It can be homogeneous, dual, or insertive, and its origin can be natural ambient light or projected light. The source and focus of light are essential elements in painting, as they determine the composition and expression of the image.\n\nThe interplay between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\", and if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\". Light's nature, origin, intensity, and chromatic quality are essential aspects to consider in the pictorial representation of light. Contrast, relief, texture, volume, gradients, and the tactile quality of the image depend on light, and the correct representation of objects in space relies on their shape, density, extension, and intensity differences.\n\nContrast is a fundamental factor in painting, with two types: luminous (by chiaroscuro or surface) and chromatic (tonal or by saturation). Contrast intensity regulation is a key tool for artists to achieve the desired expression in their work.

The intensity of contrast can vary, and its regulation is a key tool for artists to express themselves appropriately. The correspondence between light and shadow and color is achieved through tonal evaluation, which determines the appropriate color ranges for representation based on tonal values.\n\nThe representation of objects in space depends on their shape, density, extension, and intensity differences. In addition, the light and chromatic harmony of a painting depends on color, i.e. the relationship between the parts of a painting to create cohesion. There are several ways to harmonize colors, including monochrome and tone dominant melodic ranges, harmonic trios, warm and cool thermal ranges, complementary colors, and broken ranges.\n\nThe quality and appearance of the luminous representation are linked to the technique used. Different techniques and materials produce different expressions and light effects. In drawing, whether in pencil or charcoal, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality. Oil painting is the best technique for valuing light effects and chromatic tones, while pastel painting combines the qualities of drawing and painting. Watercolor is a wet technique that provides great transparency, and acrylic paint is a plastic binder that produces fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents.\n\nIn interior painting, light generally tends to create intimate environments, while in exterior painting, the main genre is landscape, where the main challenge for the artist is to capture the precise tone of natural light according to various factors.

The text also highlights the importance of correctly evaluating the tones, textures, brightness, and transparency of objects based on their material.\n\nIn the context of landscapes, the text explains that natural light varies according to the time of day, season, weather conditions, and environmental factors. Artists often paint en plein air to capture their impressions first-hand. The urban landscape, with artificial illumination and neon lights, is another genre where light plays a significant role.\n\nFor the human figure, light influences volume, generates different limits based on the play of light and shadow, and affects the color and texture of the skin. The focus of the light determines the general contour of the figure and the illumination of its surroundings. Direct light or shadow on the skin modifies the tonality, while shadows and luminous reflections generate a series of effects that the artist can exploit.\n\nIn abstract painting, light is still present, contributing luminosity to colors or creating chiaroscuro effects.

Extreme midday light is discouraged due to its dazzling effect, with artists suggesting the use of covered windows or obscuring the sun with clouds, trees, or buildings. Afternoon light was commonly used from the Renaissance to the 18th century, as it provides great relief and clarity to the figures. Sunsets were initially represented as reddish celestial vaults, but Leonardo da Vinci pioneered a more naturalistic study of twilight. Night scenes, often illuminated by the moon, stars, or artificial sources, have their own genre called nocturne.\n\nThroughout history, light has had both aesthetic and symbolic meanings in painting, often representing beauty, religion, knowledge, good, happiness, and life. The sun is associated with inspiration and imagination, while the moon symbolizes rational thought. Shadows and darkness, on the other hand, represent evil, death, ignorance, immorality, misfortune, or secrecy.\n\nIn various ancient religions, deities were identified with light, and many religious rites were based on illumination to purify the soul. In Greek mythology, Apollo is the god of the Sun and beauty, while Eos is the goddess of dawn. The Greeks related light to life, beauty, and intelligence, while shadows had a negative connotation.\n\nIn Christianity, God is often associated with light, and the Bible highlights the importance of light as a symbol of goodness, beauty, and divinity.

Early Gothic painting was characterized by uniform illumination and the absence of shadows, while later periods saw a more naturalistic use of light. The Italic or Trecentist Gothic, for instance, began to emphasize tonal nuance and the representation of depth. The Flemish Gothic period saw the emergence of oil painting, which allowed for brighter colors and greater detail.\n\nThe use of light in Gothic art, particularly in architecture and illuminated manuscripts, created spaces of transcendent and metaphysical character, often reinforced by the use of gold leaf.

They adopted Caravaggio's description of reality and chiaroscuro effects, developing a new style based on tonal chromaticism and compositional schemes. Rembrandt, a great exponent of symbolic light use, had a style close to tenebrism but with more diffused contrasts, creating mysterious atmospheres with golden shadows.\n\nAnother Dutch master, Johannes Vermeer, was nicknamed the \"painter of light\" for his fantastic effects of light and mastery of light and color harmony. Vermeer's light is natural, soft, and precise, forming figures and objects through the interaction of light and color.

This approach contrasts with academic art, which relies on linear perspective and geometry. Impressionist artists sought to capture reality as they perceived it visually, giving prominence to light and color. They painted outdoors and studied the laws of optics and the physics of light and color. Their technique involved loose brushstrokes and the application of pure colors directly on the canvas, without mixing, to achieve greater luminosity and brilliance. The impressionists were particularly interested in the effects of artificial light and produced many works set in bars, cafes, and other establishments with dim or candlelight. The main representatives of this movement were Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas. Monet, Sisley, and Pissarro were the most strictly Impressionist painters, focusing on capturing light in the landscape. Renoir developed a more personal style with a greater presence of the human figure and the use of tones such as black. Degas was an individual figure who used drawing as a compositional basis and showed interest in night and artificial light. The reaction to the spontaneous representation of light in the 1880s led to the emergence of styles such as neo-impressionism (also called divisionism or pointillism) and post-impressionism.

Signac, a disciple of Seurat, had a freer style that evolved to a search for pure sensation with a chromatism of expressionist tendency.

Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner and focused on atmospheric effects. Heade was devoted to country landscapes with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism, focusing on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style. Bingham masterfully captured in his scenes of the Far West the limpid and clear light of dawn. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, with a great interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day.
