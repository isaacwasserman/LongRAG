The policy was anticipated to be presented in January and debated in parliament in early February, with the potential use of Article 49.3 to pass the bill without a vote.\n\nThe reforms have been criticized for their disproportionate impact on women and the working class.

The government acknowledged this issue, with Minister Delegate Franck Riester admitting women would be \"a bit penalized by the reform.\"\n\nSimilarly, blue-collar workers and those in physically demanding jobs would be affected, as they often start working at a younger age and have fewer opportunities to retire early. Despite a minor concession allowing some to retire early due to work-induced disabilities, unions have largely rejected the reforms, viewing the increase in the retirement age as unacceptable.\n\nCritics argue that Macron is prioritizing businesses and the wealthy, while unfairly burdening blue-collar workers.
