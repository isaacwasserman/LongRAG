populations/individuals is still being studied. Fecundity and juvenile survival are connected to winter temperatures. Distribution shifts northward and upward in elevation are expected.\n* Amphibians: Highly vulnerable to climate change due to dependence on water regimes, specific microhabitats, and limited dispersal abilities. Rapid declines and extinctions in amphibian populations and species, especially in the tropics, have been linked to climate change. Indirect effects include changes in pathogen and disease distribution. Phenological challenges, such as advanced calling and breeding phenology, are more prominent in amphibians than in other vertebrates.\n* Reptiles: Greatest impact will be changes in phenological events and limited dispersal abilities. Reproduction and development are directly linked to climate, with potential for very profound effects if temperatures continue to rise. In some species, sex of offspring is dependent on egg temperature.\n* Fish: Likely to experience extensive changes in distribution due to temperature limits and increased volume and changed timing of stream flows. Freshwater fish habitats in mid to high elevations will be hardest hit due to reduced snowfall. Stream temperatures and invasive species will also negatively impact native fish.\n* Wetlands: Significant reduction in area, with most wetlands in danger of flooding, drying up, or relocating. Reduction in wetlands is problematic due to their role in absorbing CO2, efficiently absorbing surplus storm water, recharging aquifers, filtering pollutants, and providing livable habitats for fish and wildlife.\n* Preparing for climate change: Washington State Department of Ecology released interim recommendations in 2011 for preparing natural systems for climate change impacts.\n* Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Current climate change is due to anthropogenic GHG concentrations from burning fossil fuels, waste, and wood products, as well as agricultural and industrial activities.
