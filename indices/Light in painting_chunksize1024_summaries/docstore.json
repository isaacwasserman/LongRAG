the Renaissance, including Leonardo da Vinci's scientific study of light and Albrecht D\u00fcrer's mathematical procedure for determining shadow location.\n- Cennino Cennini's rule of creating distance through contrasts was also influential.\n- Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura (1435) emphasized the indissolubility of light and color, and the importance of illumination in painting.\n- Alberti pointed out three fundamental concepts in painting: circumscriptio (drawing, outline), compositio (arrangement of the elements), and luminum receptio (illumination).\n- Alberti

during this time. Scynography emerged as the science that studies the perspective and two-dimensional representation of forms produced by shadows.\n- Claude-Nicolas Lecat, in 1767, stated that the art of drawing proves that the mere gradation of shadow, its distribution and nuances with simple light, suffice to form the images of all objects.\n- The entry on shadow in L'Encyclop\u00e9die, the great project of Diderot and d'Alembert, differentiates between several types of shadows including inherent, cast, projected, tilted shading on the vertical axis, and tilted shading on the horizontal axis.\n- Light sources are coded as point, ambient light, and extensive. Point light produces shadows with clipped edges, ambient light produces no shadow, and extensive light produces shadows with little clipping divided into two areas: umbra, the darkened part of the area where the light source is located; and penumbra, the darkened part of the edge of a single proportion of the light area.\n- Several treatises on painting were written during this century that studied in depth the representation of light and shadow, such as those by Claude-Henri Watelet (L'Art de peindre, po\u00e8me, avec des r\u00e9flexions sur les diff\u00e9rentes parties de la peinture, 1760) and Francesco Algarotti (Saggio sopra la pittura, 1764).\n- Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (\u00c9l\u00e9mens de perspective pratique, a l'usage des artistes, suivis de r\u00e9flexions et conseils \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve sur la peinture, et particuli\u00e8rement sur le genre du paysage, 1799) made several studies on the rendering of light at various times of the day.\n- Rococo meant the survival of the main artistic manifestations of the Baroque, with a more emphasized sense of decoration", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_36": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "- Rococo painting in France:\n\t+ Jean-Antoine Watteau: f\u00eate galante, court scenes in bucolic landscapes\n\t+ Fran\u00e7ois Boucher: female nude, soft and delicate style, mythological scenes\n\t+ Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard: gallant scenes of frivolity, sentimental style\n\t+ Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin: still life, mastery of light and atmosphere\n\n- Venetian vedutismo:\n\t+ Urban views, detailed depiction of Venice\n\t+ Canaletto: sublime landscapes, precision through camera obscura\n\t+ Francesco Guardi: interested in light effects on water and atmosphere, precursor of impressionism\n\n- 18th-century landscape painting:\n\t+ Incorporation of picturesque and sublime aesthetics\n\t+ Michel-Ange Houasse: innovative use of light in landscape composition\n\t+ Claude Joseph Vernet: seascapes, nocturnal environments, influenced by Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa\n\t+ Hubert Robert: picturesque landscapes, interest in ruins\n\n- English landscape painting:\n\t+ Great influence of Claude Lorrain\n\t+ Love for gardens, landscape painting in high demand\n\t+ Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne, and Thomas Gainsborough: prominent landscape painters\n\n- Joseph Wright of Derby:\n\t+ Focus on artificial light effects\n\t+ Influenced by Italian experiences with fireworks and Vesuvius\n\t+ Masterpiece: Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump (1768, The National Gallery, London)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_37": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "- Artistic value in capturing atmosphere, similar to contemplation of real landscape\n- 18th century prominent artists: Richard Wilson, Alexander Cozens, John Robert Cozens, Robert Salmon, Samuel Scott, Francis Towne, Thomas Gainsborough\n- Joseph Wright of Derby: interested in artificial light and its effects, especially fireworks and eruptions of Vesuvius\n- Masterpiece: Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump (1768, The National Gallery, London)\n- Light source in center, metaphor for Enlightenment light illuminating all humans equally\n- Wright's \"candle light pictures\" with violent contrasts of light and shadow\n- Light symbolizes reason and knowledge in Wright's scientific subject paintings\n- Francisco de Goya: evolved from Rococo style to certain prerromanticism, personal and expressive work\n- Goya's metaphorical use of light as the conqueror of darkness\n- Light represents reason, knowledge, and freedom;
