However, midday light was often avoided due to its intense brightness, which made it difficult to accurately depict shadows and colors. Instead, artists often preferred the afternoon light, which provided good relief and was widely used from the Renaissance to the 18th century. Leonardo da Vinci's studies of twilight led to a more naturalistic representation of sunsets, while the night remained a singularity in painting, often constituting its own genre (nocturne). Night scenes were typically illuminated by the moon, stars, or artificial light sources, and were often justified by iconographic themes.

The Gothic stained glass is another example, where light represents divine omnipresence.\n\nIn Christian art, light is often used to emphasize divinity, such as in halos of saints, angels, and members of the Holy Family, or in the form of rays radiating from divine figures. Light also signifies God's wrath or eternal divinity, depending on the context.\n\nThroughout history, the symbolism of light has evolved, transitioning from a transcendental or divine light to a symbol of knowledge, goodness, and rebirth, opposing ignorance, evil, and death.

In Christianity, it has evolved from a symbol of divine presence to knowledge and rebirth. In Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, light represents truth, wisdom, and divine connection. Freemasonry uses light as a symbol of ascent in degrees and eternal salvation.\n\nThe technical representation of light in painting began in classical Greco-Roman art, with the invention of adumbration, chiaroscuro, and skiagraphia.

Hellenistic art, particularly in landscape painting, widely used chiaroscuro, while Roman painting incorporated it in illusory architectures. However, the use of light and shadow contrasts diminished during the Middle Ages.\n\nByzantine and Romanesque art adopted the use of illusionistic light but shifted its function to a more rhetorical and aesthetic role, valuing the luminosity and splendor of shines and reflections, especially of gold and precious stones.

This movement, which identified light with divine beauty, greatly affected Gothic art, resulting in brighter cathedrals with large stained-glass windows that created dynamic plays of light and color.\n\nThe new focus on light in the Middle Ages significantly impacted various artistic genres, including architecture and illuminated manuscripts. In painting, however, light was not as prominent, as it was not based in reality and lacked a source or expansion of light. Shadows were generally avoided, as they were associated with evil.

Jan van Eyck developed a technique of oil painting that used glazes to create atmospheric luminosity and greater depth. Other Dutch artists, such as Dirk Bouts, Petrus Christus, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, also contributed to the exploration of light in art. This period saw a shift towards naturalistic representation of light, while still retaining its symbolic and metaphysical significance.

Alberti believed that color is a quality of light and that to color is to \"give light\" to a painting, and he discussed the use of white and black pigments to create light and dark effects.\n\nAlberti's theories greatly influenced Florentine painting, leading to the development of the pittura di luce style. Artists like Domenico Veneziano, Fra Angelico, Paolo Uccello, Andrea del Castagno, and Piero della Francesca used light to create relief and brilliance in their paintings. Veneziano was known for his use of clear sunlight, Fra Angelico for his symbolic and scientific use of light, Uccello for his independent lighting of objects, and Piero della Francesca for his use of light to define space and volume.\n\nOther artists, like Masaccio, used light to emphasize the drama of the scene and create a sense of perspective without relying on geometry.

The school's main representatives, Carlo Crivelli, Antonello da Messina, and Giovanni Bellini, made significant contributions to the development of this naturalistic approach to light. Bellini, in particular, was known for his emotional sensitivity to light and his innovative use of the oil technique to create striking light effects.\n\nAdditionally, the sfumato technique, traditionally attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, emerged during this period.

Van Baburen focused on full light effects and intense volumes, while Honthorst mastered artificial light in night scenes. Rembrandt, another notable artist, used symbolic and divine light, often concentrating it in one area to create glowing luminosity and dematerialize bodies.

Unlike other artists who used chiaroscuro, Vermeer increased tonal intensity by placing a dark foreground and dissolved color towards white.\n\nOther Dutch painters, like Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens, also explored light and color in their works. Hals had a Caravaggist phase with clear chromaticism and diffuse luminosity, while Jordaens was known for his bright and fantastic coloring with strong contrasts of light and shadow.\n\nIn the realm of landscape painting, which thrived in Holland during this period, artists such as Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde focused on atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water.

Aelbert Cuyp used a lighter, warmer palette influenced by Italian landscapes. Meindert Hobbema, an assistant to Jacob van Ruysdael, was recognized for his chromatic contrasts and lively light effects.\n\nIn addition to landscapes, still lifes also flourished in Holland, with Willem Kalf being one of its prominent artists. Kalf's still lifes displayed great precision in detail, combining various objects and food with a play of light and shadow on metallic and crystalline surfaces.\n\nIn Italy, classicism emerged as a reaction to mannerism, with artists like the Carracci brothers, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Guercino, and Giovanni Lanfranco. They aimed for an idealized representation of nature, inspired by classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance art. Italian classicism later branched into several currents, with some artists focusing on decorativism and others on landscape painting.\n\nClaudio de Lorena, a baroque painter, was particularly skilled at representing light in his works.

This light, often originating from sunrises or sunsets, gently illuminated the entire scene and created a sense of depth by blurring contours and degrading colors. Lorraine's light investigations preceded impressionism, as he emphasized color and light over material description. Unlike his German contemporary, Adam Elsheimer, who preferred exceptional and nocturnal light effects, Lorraine chose more natural environments and light sources. Meanwhile, the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, known for his mythological themes and robust female figures, mastered various lighting techniques, combining them to create powerful atmospheres in his work.

These academies promoted a classical and canonical style, known as academicism, which was often criticized for its conservatism. During this period, the science of optics, including the study of shadows, gained prominence, leading to the emergence of scynography, the science that studies the perspective and two-dimensional representation of forms produced by shadows.\n\nSeveral scholars, including Claude-Nicolas Lecat and Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, conducted in-depth studies on the representation of light and shadow in painting. Valenciennes, in particular, advised his students to paint the same landscape at different times of the day, focusing on four distinctive moments: morning, noon, twilight, and night.\n\nIn the world of art, Rococo emerged as a survival of the Baroque's main artistic manifestations, with a stronger emphasis on decoration and ornamental taste.

Early in his career, he focused on landscapes and seascapes with various lighting effects, such as sunrise, sunset, winter, stormy, and foggy conditions.\n\nFriedrich's mature works often had strong symbolic content, like \"Memorial Image for Johann Emanuel Bremer\" (1817), which depicted a twilight garden and a faint dawn light representing the afterlife. His \"Woman at Sunrise\" (1818-1820) is an allegory of life as a Holy Communion, with a reddish-yellow sky of great intensity. He also explored the symbolism of dawn and dusk as birth and death in works like \"Sea with Sunrise\" (1826).\n\nFriedrich's pantheistic mysticism influenced other artists, such as Georg Friedrich Kersting, who applied it to interior scenes with soft lamp or candlelight.

Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, a forerunner of Impressionism, was recognized for his shimmering, slightly misty skies and water reflections.\n\nGermany had Adolph von Menzel, influenced by Constable, who developed a style anticipating Impressionism with light playing a crucial role in his works. Hans Thoma, inspired by Courbet, combined realism's social vindication with romantic landscape feelings, using silver-toned light. In the Netherlands, Johan Barthold Jongkind, a pre-impressionist, was celebrated for his atmospheric phenomena interpretations and light play on water and snow.\n\nIn Russia, a realist school emerged, known for landscape and genre scenes with social denunciation.

Among its most notable representatives were Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Vincent van Gogh. C\u00e9zanne developed a compositional system based on geometric figures and a new method of illumination using color density and intensity. Van Gogh was particularly interested in light, experimenting with various techniques and influences, creating dramatic atmospheres and later incorporating divisionist techniques.\n\nDuring this period, the Italian movement Scapigliatura (1860-1880) focused on the purity of color and study of light, with artists like Tranquillo Cremona, Mos\u00e8 Bianchi, and Daniele Ranzoni attempting to capture feelings through chromatic vibrations and blurred contours.

Giovanni Segantini, also from Italy, combined academicist drawing with post-impressionist coloring, focusing on mountain landscapes with vibrant light effects.\n\nIn Germany, Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt were representatives of Impressionism. Uhde was more of a plenairist and focused on religious genre painting with a special sensitivity to light. Corinth had an eclectic career, moving from academic beginnings to impressionism, decadentism, Jugendstil, and expressionism. Slevogt adopted the fresh and brilliant chromatism of the Impressionists but with loose brushstrokes and energetic movement, influenced by Baroque art.\n\nIn Great Britain, James Abbott McNeil Whistler's landscapes recreated the foggy and taciturn English climate, with a preference for night scenes and artificial light effects. In the United States, John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam were notable artists. Sargent was an admirer of Vel\u00e1zquez and Frans Hals and excelled as a social portraitist. Cassatt, who lived in Paris, developed an intimate and sophisticated work influenced by Japanese prints. Hassam's main motif was New York life, with a fresh but somewhat cloying style.\n\nScandinavian Impressionism, with artists like Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, and Anders Zorn, was characterized by a special sensitivity to light, often influenced by the \"light of the south\" in France and Italy.

American Luminism, introduced by John Ireland Howe Baur, features polished realism, precise gradations of tone, and subtle variations in tonality, exemplified by the Hudson River School, including artists like Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, and Frederic Edwin Church. Pure Luminism, centered in the New England area, is characterized by peaceful, anecdotal landscapes with crystalline light and neat brushstrokes, while Hudson River School landscape painting has a more cosmic vision and a preference for dramatic visual effects.

Heade focused on country landscapes with various light conditions, while Fitz Henry Lane, considered the greatest luminist, emphasized light in his Gloucester works. Suydam, Kensett, and Silva also focused on light in their coastal and New England landscapes.\n\nCropsey combined Hudson River School panoramas with the serene luminism of Lane and Heade. Bingham captured the Far West's clear light, and Winslow Homer, a prominent American painter, excelled in seascapes with atmospheric effects.

This transcendent light, influenced by the artists' emotions and feelings, was frequently executed using impressionist and pointillist techniques.\n\nIn Belgium, F\u00e9licien Rops, Fernand Khnopff, and William Degouve de Nuncques were prominent symbolist figures. Rops focused on perversity and eroticism, Khnopff on dreamlike-allegorical themes of women transformed into angels or sphinxes, and Degouve de Nuncques on urban landscapes with a dreamlike, pre-surrealist quality.\n\nCentral European symbolists Arnold B\u00f6cklin, Ferdinand Hodler, and Gustav Klimt also made significant contributions.

Avant-garde movements emerged, seeking to integrate art into society and vindicate the two-dimensionality of painting. These movements rejected traditional methods of optical representation, such as Renaissance perspective, and embraced new artistic methods like photography, film, and video. Light art, a variant of installations, also had a significant impact on the art of this century.\n\nNa\u00eff art, or \"na\u00efve\" in French, was a precedent for avant-garde art, characterized by self-taught painters who developed a spontaneous style, alien to traditional painting principles. Henri Rousseau, one of its best representatives, produced a personal work with a poetic tone, a taste for the exotic, and unreal-looking lighting, influencing artists like Picasso or Kandinski and movements like metaphysical painting and surrealism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_57": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The avant-garde movements aimed to integrate art into society by emphasizing the relationship between the artist and the spectator, who interprets the work individually.

Light art, a type of installation, also became significant. Artists started experimenting with various light sources and their interplay, leading to innovative sensorial experiences.\n\nIn the early 20th century, avant-garde movements rapidly emerged, each with a unique technique and vision of light and color in painting. Fauvism (1904-1908), one of the first movements focused on light and color, treated light with maximum saturation and strong chromatic contrasts. Artists like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard were part of this movement, which focused on a new conception of pictorial illumination through the negation of shadows and the use of intense, radiant colors.\n\nExpressionism (1905-1923) arose as a reaction to impressionism, emphasizing personal and intuitive art. Expressionist artists deformed reality to accentuate the expressive character of their work, often reflecting intimate and fantastic themes.

In abstract art, light is less prominent but still present in tonal gradations and chiaroscuro games.\n\nPicasso's works, such as \"La jornada del operario\" and \"Arc Lamp,\" show his exploration of daily life and artificial light. Meanwhile, Futurism, with artists like Delaunay and Boccioni, emphasized color, movement, and light. Futurism also influenced parallel movements like English Vorticism and Russian Rayonism.\n\nIn the interwar period, the New Objectivity movement emerged in Germany, focusing on realistic figuration and objective representation, with a social and vindictive component. Artists like Otto Dix, George Grosz, and Max Beckmann were part of this movement, which did not renounce avant-garde art achievements.\n\nSurrealism, with artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed and Ren\u00e9 Magritte, placed special emphasis on imagination, fantasy, and the world of dreams.

He abandoned avant-gardism in 1948 and returned to classicist painting, interpreting it in a personal and subjective way, with a focus on new and surprising pictorial effects. His later works are notable for their luminosity, such as \"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\" (1951), \"The Last Supper\" (1955), \"The Perpignan Station\" (1965), and \"Cosmic Athlete\" (1968).\n\nMir\u00f3's works reflect a magical and telluric light, rooted in the landscape of the countryside of Tarragona. His style is characterized by flat and dense colors, nocturnal environments, and objects and figures bathed in an unreal light.\n\nIn the United States, between the 1920s and 1930s, several figurative movements emerged, especially interested in everyday reality and life in cities, including artificial lights in streets and avenues as well as commercial and indoor lights. The Ashcan School and American realism or American Scene were two of these movements, with artists like Robert Henri, George Wesley Bellows, John French Sloan, and Edward Hopper.
