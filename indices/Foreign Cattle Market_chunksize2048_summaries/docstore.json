In 1855, the livestock market was moved to a new location in Islington, known as the Metropolitan Cattle Market. The demand for meat increased due to a growing population and higher wages, but the British farming industry couldn't meet the demand, leading to the importation of foreign cattle duty-free. This practice, however, resulted in the introduction of diseases, such as rinderpest, which spread rapidly throughout Britain. In response to the cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7, new laws were enacted, including the establishment of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, for imported animals. Located in Deptford, this market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market opened in 1872 and by 1880, most imported animals were slaughtered at Deptford. The market operated through private bargains between salesmen and buyers, with buyers estimating the weight of the live animals. The market's volume of trade increased significantly, with 78% of London's live cattle trade going to Deptford by 1907. However, in the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers started bypassing the marketing system, leading to the slaughter of 16.5 million animals at Deptford.

Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896). The market had about 110 direct employees and 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, who were paid on piecework and could earn high wages but with irregular hours and precarious employment. Women were employed for unpleasant jobs such as cleaning cattle and sheep intestines.

This market became the primary hub for London's live cattle trade by 1907, with 78% of the city's live cattle trade going to Deptford.\n\nWomen, referred to as \"gut girls,\" were employed to clean cattle and sheep intestines, which were used for making sausage skins and, according to a later source, condoms. This work was originally done by men, but after they went on strike for higher pay, management assigned the task to women. Approximately 80-100 women and girls, aged 14 to 40, worked for two firms that had contracted to buy all the gut offal from the market's slaughterhouses. The work was physically demanding and unpleasant, but it offered relatively good pay for women's work.\n\nQueen Victoria took an interest in the working conditions of the market, prompting her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Albany, to investigate. The Duchess discovered that the gut firms had been processing entrails from outside the market, posing a health risk. The City's markets committee banned the practice, leaving the women unemployed. A charity, the Deptford Fund, was established to support them.\n\nDeptford market was a significant player in the global meat market, with half of London's meat coming from the Foreign Cattle Market. The market's influence extended to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet, with commercial relationships radiating out to various European ports and beyond.

However, the trade faced challenges such as the Beef Trust's control over the meat market and animal welfare concerns during long journeys. By 1900, the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America, and by 1909, it was reported that the Trust controlled the North Atlantic meat trade, but its power to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and large shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat, which was already being imported into London in 1875 and was much cheaper to send across the Atlantic than on the hoof.

The market faced issues such as live animal disease, competition from chilled meat, and changing regulations. The market's decline and eventual closure are documented in articles such as \"Deptford Cattle Market; Its Decaying Industry\" (1914) and \"Sale of Deptford Market\" (1926).
