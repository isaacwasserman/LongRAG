The system, which has ensured a guaranteed state-backed pension for retirees, has been strained by rising life expectancy and a decreasing worker-to-retiree ratio. France has one of the lowest retirement ages among industrialized nations and spends a significant portion of its GDP on pensions.\n\nTo keep the system financially viable, the French government, under President Macron, proposed pension reforms that would gradually raise the legal retirement age to 64 by 2030, increase the number of years required for a full pension, and eliminate special pension rules for certain sectors. These reforms aimed to balance the pensions deficit by 2030 and create a surplus to fund early retirement options for physically demanding jobs.\n\nHowever, the proposed reforms faced opposition from various trade unions, which argued that the changes would disproportionately affect low-income workers in manual jobs and women, who typically retire later and with lower pensions. Polls showed that the majority of the population opposed the reforms and the use of Article 49.3 to enact them without a parliamentary vote.\n\nIn March 2023, President Macron invoked Article 49.3 to pass the pension reform bill, avoiding a vote in the National Assembly due to uncertainty about securing enough support. This decision was seen as a defeat and a sign of weakness for the government, causing a decline in Macron's approval ratings and sparking criticism about the perceived brutality and undemocratic nature of using Article 49.3. The reforms are expected to result in women retiring later and working longer hours, while disproportionately impacting blue-collar workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_1": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "France's pension reforms, proposed by President Macron, have been met with widespread opposition and protests.
