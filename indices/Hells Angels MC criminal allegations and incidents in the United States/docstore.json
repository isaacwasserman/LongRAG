HAMC chapters were established in Anchorage and Fairbanks in December 1982 following a merger with the Brothers MC. The Brothers were formed in 1967, and established an association with the Hells Angels in California's San Francisco Bay Area by 1977. The club \"patched over\" to the HAMC during a ceremony in California attended by members of the Brothers' Fairbanks chapter. The Alaskan Hells Angels are involved in methamphetamine trafficking. Operation CACUS. Anchorage Hells Angels chapter sergeant-at-arms Anthony John Tait volunteered to become a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1985, and he provided the government with detailed information on the club's organization and criminal activities \u2013 such as drugs and explosives trafficking \u2013 for two years. During this period, Tait travelled the country at government expense to meet with various Hells Angels members, and he covertly recorded some of these meetings by wearing a wire. As part of the investigation, the informant and undercover agents purchased approximately $1.6 million of cocaine and methamphetamine from the Hells Angels, in addition to more than twenty pounds of explosives, three automatic weapons and two silencers. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation CACUS culminated with 38 HAMC members in Alaska and four other states being arrested on narcotics, weapons, explosives and conspiracy charges on November 10, 1987. Anchorage chapter president Edward Floyd Hubert and Fairbanks chapter president Dennis E. Pailing were among fourteen people taken into custody during raids by FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents on homes in Anchorage and a compound in Fairbanks.Ten Hells Angels from California and Alaska, including Hubert and Pailing, were extradited to Louisville, Kentucky to face charges of conspiring to transport firearms and explosives across state lines in order to kill members of the Outlaws in retaliation for the death of John Cleave Webb, the previous Anchorage Hells Angels president who was fatally shot by two Outlaws outside a saloon in Jefferson County, Kentucky on August 12, 1986. On October 28, 1988, Anchorage chapter members Hubert, Lawrence Russell Hagel and Gerald G. Protzman were convicted of the misdemeanor charge of converting a government intelligence manual for their use, while Pailing and four other Alaskan Angels were acquitted. Other members of the Alaska and California chapters were convicted on state drug and firearm charges either side of the federal trial. The Hells Angels allegedly put a $1 million bounty on Tait's life. Federal racketeering case. Four Alaskan Hells Angels \u2013 Montgomery David Elliott, Michael Hurn, Dale Leedom and William Spearman \u2013 were arrested by ATF agents on federal racketeering and firearms charges during raids at three homes in Anchorage and one in Two Rivers on December 3, 2003. HAMC clubhouses in Anchorage and North Pole were also searched. The charges, filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, stemmed from the River Run riot \u2013 a conflict between the Hells Angels and the Mongols on April 27, 2002, which left three bikers dead in Laughlin, Nevada \u2013 and followed a twenty-month ATF investigation of the club. The operation resulted in the arrests of a total of fifty-eight Hells Angels members and associates by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in Alaska and four other Western states for narcotics trafficking, firearms violations, possessing stolen explosives and various other crimes. Leedom, the Fairbanks chapter president, was one of six Hells Angels convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to face charges; he pleaded no contest to committing a violent crime in the aid of racketeering in October 2006 and was sentenced to two years in prison on February 13, 2007. Thirty-six others had charges against them dismissed. Violent incidents. Hells Angels member James William Leffel was convicted of first-degree assault for stabbing a man named Jens Schurig in the thigh, opening his femoral artery, outside a bar in Anchorage after Schurig allegedly denigrated Leffel's motorcycle.On August 3, 2017, Michael \"Steak Knife\" Staton was kidnapped and taken to a duplex in Wasilla where he was tortured, beaten and killed by members of the 1488s \u2013 a white supremacist prison gang to which he belonged \u2013 after he was accused of stealing drugs and \"colors\" from Craig \"Oakie\" King, a Hells Angels member and 1488s associate.

King and four others were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in January 2023. Methamphetamine trafficking. Hells Angels member Charles Denver \"Pup\" Phillips and his wife Lois Latrilla Phillips were arrested after an FBI drug task force discovered twelve pounds of methamphetamine and almost $25,000 in cash at their apartment and in a nearby shipping container in Anchorage on August 10, 2018. Investigators also found a ledger listing money and quantities, and a list of names of Hells Angels prospects throughout the state. The couple were convicted of distributing and conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. On October 30, 2019, Charles Phillips was sentenced to eighteen years in federal prison, and his wife was sentenced to five years. Arizona. The HAMC has approximately a hundred members in Arizona and is classified as a criminal street gang by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS). The Arizona Hells Angels produce methamphetamine \u2013 independently and in conjunction with Mexican drug cartels \u2013 and also distribute the drug at retail level. The HAMC's predecessor in the state, the Dirty Dozen, voted to merge with the Hells Angels in 1996 and officially \"patched over\" during a meeting in Oakland, California in October 1997. With the merger of the Dirty Dozen, the Hells Angels established six Arizona chapters, in Phoenix, Mesa, Tucson, Cave Creek and Flagstaff, as well as a nomads chapter. Methamphetamine trafficking. In June 2001, Greg \"Snake\" Surdukan and Chris \"Porker\" Baucum, president and vice-president of the Hells Angels' nomads chapter in Arizona, were arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) uncovered an international drug network involving the smuggling of methamphetamine into the United States from South Africa. The smuggling ring was allegedly established in November 1999 and involved South African Hells Angels members speed mailing methamphetamine hidden inside stuffed toys to their American counterparts in Flagstaff, from where it was distributed to other U.S. states. On June 17, 2002, Surdukan and Baucum pleaded guilty to drug trafficking; Surdukan was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. Operation Black Biscuit. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) initiated an undercover investigation into the Arizona Hells Angels in September 2001 when Rudolph \"Rudy\" Kramer \u2013 a member of the Solo Angeles, a club based in Tijuana, Mexico with a small presence in southern California \u2013 agreed to become an informant and infiltrate other motorcycle gangs in exchange for the dismissal of charges against him after he was arrested by ATF agents for weapons violations. The investigation, known as Operation Black Biscuit, resulted in a twenty-one month infiltration of the club by a team of ATF agents, technicians and confidential informants. Kramer made contacts throughout the state as a dealer of methamphetamine and firearms, and he began collaborating with the Hells Angels in narcotics and weapons smuggling after fabricating a story that he was arming the Solo Angeles in Mexico to combat a Mongols chapter there. He sought permission from the HAMC to form a Solo Angeles nomads chapter in Arizona, which the ATF used to make contact with the Hells Angels. Kramer began introducing ATF agents posing as Solo Angeles bikers to Hells Angels leaders statewide after a meeting with Mesa chapter president Robert \"Bad Bob\" Johnston Jr. in July 2002.

The drug-addicted Kramer eventually became a liability to the operation, however, and was returned to prison after the firearm indictment against him was reinstated in September 2002. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty, and he later entered protective custody. Information on Kramer's role as an informant soon leaked, and Hells Angels leaders in Arizona also began hearing rumors from southern California that the Solo Angeles were imposters. In an effort to ensure credibility, undercover ATF agent Jay Dobyns told the Hells Angels in June 2003 that he and another Solo Angeles biker would be travelling to Sonora to kill Mongols. The ATF then staged the murder of a Mongols member by photographing and videotaping a law enforcement officer posing as the rival biker laying in a shallow grave, splattered with lamb blood and brains. Dobyns had bloodstained Mongols colors mailed to the Hells Angels from Mexico, and provided a videotape and pictures of the staged killing. The ruse proved successful and, according to Dobyns and the ATF, he was subsequently voted in as a member of the Hells Angels' Skull Valley chapter. Sonny Barger and the HAMC have vehemently denied that Dobyns was ever awarded membership.Operation Black Biscuit was ended prematurely because the ATF believed Robert \"Chico\" Mora, a senior member of the Hells Angels' Phoenix chapter, was plotting to murder the Solo Angeles. Mora did not know the Solo Angeles were undercover agents, but believed they were a potential rival encroaching on the Hells Angels' territory. He allegedly assembled a group of veteran Hells Angels enforcers to liquidate the Solo Angeles. The operation culminated with a series of synchronized raids carried out across Arizona on July 8, 2003, and the arrests of fifty-two people; sixteen Hells Angels members and associates were indicted on charges including RICO Act violations, murder and drug trafficking. Over 500 illegal weapons, including silencers, pipe bombs, sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, along with ammunition, $50,000 in cash and drugs were also seized. During one of the raids, on a HAMC clubhouse in North Phoenix, club prospect Michael Wayne Coffelt was shot and wounded with a rifle by police officer Laura Beeler. He was subsequently charged with aggravated assault against Beeler, who reported that Coffelt fired first and was cleared of any wrongdoing in the shooting by county prosecutors. The charges against Coffelt were dismissed in November 2004 when judge Michael Wilkinson of the Maricopa County Superior Court ruled that the police violated state search-and-seizure laws during the raid. Investigators determined that Coffelt never fired at Beeler. Operation Black Biscuit was deemed a success by the ATF, but internal government disagreement ultimately led to the sixteen defendants escaping conviction on the key charges of racketeering and murder. Half of the defendants plea bargained to lesser offenses, and five others had federal charges dismissed. The plea agreements resulted in no more than five-year prison sentences. In 2004, Mora was convicted of the federal charge of possessing body armor with intent to sell and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. The conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded as a result of the investigation. Murder of Cynthia Garcia. On October 27, 2001, full-patch Hells Angels members Kevin J. Augustiniak and Michael Christopher \"Mesa Mike\" Kramer, and prospective member Paul Merle Eischeid murdered Cynthia Yvonne Garcia, a forty-four-year-old mother of six who verbally disrespected the club and its members while in an intoxicated state during a party at the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Mesa.

After beating Garcia unconscious, the three bikers loaded her into the trunk of a car and drove her into the desert near the Salt River where they stabbed her twenty-seven times and attempted to decapitate her. Garcia's body was discovered on October 31. Kramer contacted ATF agent John Ciccone the following month and, without disclosing his crime, offered to become an informant. After moving to Los Angeles, California and infiltrating the club's San Fernando Valley chapter by posing as an Arizona drug runner, Kramer offered the ATF information on Garcia's killing in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Fourteen months after becoming an informant, he signed a plea agreement to serve five years of probation for the murder. Eischeid fled the country following his indictment for the killing in 2007 and was placed on the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was apprehended in the San Isidro district of Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 3, 2011, after being tracked by the USMS, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and Interpol. Eischeid was extradited to Arizona in July 2018 after exhausting all of his appeals in the Argentine legal system. Augustiniak pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in October 2011 and was sentenced to twenty-three years and six months' imprisonment on March 30, 2012. Conflict with the Mongols. Joshua William Harber, a member of the Hells Angels chapter in Ventura, California, was shot in the face outside a bar in Cave Creek on June 8, 2002, and died later that day at John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix. Harber's unidentified killer fled the scene in a car after the shooting. While Phoenix Police Department detectives investigated several motives for the murder, including the possibility of retaliation by the Mongols for the killing of a Mongol by the Hells Angels at the River Run riot in Laughlin, Nevada on April 27, 2002, the crime has become a cold case.Cave Creek Hells Angels chapter president Daniel Leroy \"Hoover\" Seybert was shot to death outside a bar in Phoenix on March 22, 2003. The autopsy report showed that Seybert was shot in the head at close range by a small caliber handgun which was located during the investigation in Seybert's back pocket. The homicide has never been solved and there have been various theories regarding the reason for Seybert's killing. It has been speculated that he was killed by the Mongols, by the Hells Angels as part of an internal conflict, or by the ATF in relation to Operation Black Biscuit. Two days after Seybert's death, a Mongols member was stabbed in the back and wounded at a gas station in Reno, Nevada by a suspected Hells Angels member in a possible revenge attack.Seven Hells Angels \u2013 including the Tucson chapter president, the former Mesa chapter president and other leaders \u2013 were arrested in Arizona on various charges on December 3, 2003, following a two-year investigation of the club by the ATF. Five of those were indicted at the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on federal racketeering and firearms charges stemming from the River Run riot. The raids in Arizona were carried out as part of a coordinated operation which led to the arrests of at least fifty-five Hells Angels members and associates in five Western states by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Two Arizona Angels \u2013 Rodney Cox and Calvin Schaefer \u2013 were among six HAMC members convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to stand trial. Schaefer was sentenced to four years and three months in a federal prison on January 12, 2007, for committing a violent crime in the aid of racketeering. Cox was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on February 23, 2007, after pleading guilty to the same charge. Charges were dismissed against thirty-six others.Patrick Michael Eberhardt, treasurer of the Hells Angels' Cave Creek chapter, was shot dead and a club hangaround was wounded when a group of six Hells Angels were fired upon while riding their motorcycles in Phoenix on February 7, 2015.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_4": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Two Arizona Angels \u2013 Rodney Cox and Calvin Schaefer \u2013 were among six HAMC members convicted in the case after being extradited to Las Vegas, Nevada to stand trial.

Earlier that day, a group of unidentified bikers had fired shots at members of the Mongols nearby. A Mongols member is one of the two suspects in Eberhardt's unsolved murder.On August 17, 2016, Hells Angels Mesa chapter member Wayne Whitt opened fire outside a sports bar in Tempe, killing one Mongols member \u2013 Richard \"AZ Slick\" Garcia \u2013 and wounding another before fleeing on his motorcycle. The shooting followed a verbal altercation between the rival bikers inside the bar. Three surviving Mongols \u2013 Frank Gardea, John Magana and Efren Ontiveros \u2013 were arrested, although the Tempe Police Department declined to press charges against Whitt as the shooting was deemed self-defense. Conflict with the Vagos. Five Hells Angels and two members of the Desert Road Riders \u2013 a club founded in Bullhead City in 1993 that became a HAMC support club in 2002 \u2013 were arrested on December 2, 2009, by an AZDPS task force as part of Operation Quiet Riot, a six-month investigation into a turf war involving the Hells Angels, Desert Road Riders and Vagos in Mohave County. On April 11, 2012, four Hells Angels members \u2013 Stephen Helland, Dale Hormut, Rudolfo \"Rudy\" Martinez and Gerald Smith \u2013 were acquitted of rioting and assisting in a criminal street gang. Another, George \"Joby\" Walters, took a plea deal and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. The charges stemmed from an alleged riot involving the rival clubs at a bar in Bullhead City on June 11, 2009.Members of the Hells Angels were allegedly involved in a shoot-out with Vagos members in Chino Valley on August 21, 2010; over fifty shots were fired and at least five people were wounded, although no life-threatening injuries were reported. After dozens of law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, twenty-seven people were arrested on charges ranging from attempted murder and aggravated assault to participation in a criminal street gang. Charges against seven Hells Angels members \u2013 John Bernard, Kevin Christiansen, Kiley Hill, Robert Kittredge, Michael Koepke, Larry Scott, Jr. and Bruce Schweigert \u2013 were dismissed in June 2012 after it transpired that Alfred Acevedo, the only direct witness to the confrontation between the gangs immediately before the shooting, was a Vagos hangaround working as an informant for AZDPS detective John Morris, and who had previously tried to infiltrate the Hells Angels and was rebuked. Other incidents. Hells Angels member Nathaniel Barton Sample was convicted in September 2009 of aggravated assault and acting for the benefit of a street gang following an incident at a Scottsdale bar on March 28, 2008, in which he and another man, Jose Cano, attacked an unidentified third man who had accidentally bumped into them. The case marked the first time the HAMC had been labelled a gang in the state of Arizona.Former Tucson Hells Angels chapter president William Gary \"Tramp\" Potter, who was expelled from the club due to his methamphetamine use and also because he was suspected of being a government informant, was arrested after deputies from the Pima County Sheriff's Department found the body of Randall Scott Pfeil buried in his yard on July 13, 2010. Pfeil was the subject of a missing persons investigation and had been shot twice in the head. Potter pleaded guilty in April 2012 to second-degree murder and two counts of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. On June 4, 2012, he was sentenced to nineteen years in prison.Hells Angels Yavapai County chapter treasurer Bruce Schweigert, Sr. was sentenced to eight years in prison on August 12, 2014, after being convicted of threatening and intimidating as a criminal street gang member, assault, disorderly conduct and felony misconduct involving weapons, charges stemming from an August 2013 bar fight in Cottonwood.

California. With over 300 members statewide, the Hells Angels are the most significant motorcycle gang in California in terms of membership and criminal activity. The club has a significant role in the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, and in other illegal enterprises. The West Coast faction of the HAMC has also been especially active in the infiltration of legitimate businesses, including motorcycle and automobile services, catering operations, bars, restaurants, and antique stores. Colorado. The Hells Angels have three chapters in Colorado. The club initiated its first chapter in the state on June 13, 2001, by amalgamating the Brothers Fast MC, a club founded in Denver in 1963. The HAMC inherited the Brothers Fast's methamphetamine distribution operations and expanded into Colorado at a time when the Sons of Silence, historically the state's preeminent motorcycle gang, were severely weakened as a result of a federal investigation. Violent incidents. On August 5, 1996, two members of the Hells Angels' San Fernando Valley, California chapter \u2013 Donald Dinehart and Larry Lajeunesse \u2013 were shot and wounded at the Iron Horse Inn in Steamboat Springs, which was hosting the club's annual rally. Dinehart was airlifted to Denver Health Medical Center and underwent surgery for gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and chest, while Lajeunesse was treated at Routt Memorial Hospital after being shot in the hand. A member of the Ventura, California chapter was suspected of the shooting, which police believed was carried out as a punishment for a breach of club rules. HAMC members reportedly blocked police from entering the motel where the incident took place until after evidence had been removed. Over 200 Hells Angels attended the convention, and several beatings and a stabbing at local bars were also attributed to the bikers. By the end of the four-day rally, 160 police officers from 27 agencies had been drafted into Steamboat Springs to assist the 24 officers on duty in the town.A group of Hells Angels were allegedly involved in a bar fight with other patrons at the Black Nugget Saloon in Carbondale on November 19, 2005. The bikers were reportedly attending a benefit concert featuring several area punk rock bands to raise money to pay the legal fees of a prospective club member when they were provoked by a group of locals, resulting in a brawl. Kevin Hilgeford suffered a broken jaw and two broken ribs, while Kurt Trede, another patron purported to have been injured in the melee, left the bar before an ambulance arrived. Both men declined to press charges. Hilgeford denied being the instigator of the violence and claimed he was the victim of \"a jumping\".John Lockhart, a prospective member of the Hells Angels' LaSalle-based Colorado nomads chapter, was charged on June 19, 2017, with two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of vehicular eluding and illegal discharge of a firearm after a series of incidents in Weld County in which a gun was fired at two vehicles, including a police car. In the early hours of June 11, Lockhart shot from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle through the rear window of a sport utility vehicle driven by Faustino Garcia in a road rage incident in Greeley, before also firing at and hitting a pursuing police cruiser near Colorado State Highway 60 in Milliken. He was identified by investigators via surveillance video after being observed speeding in Greeley on June 13. On March 22, 2019, Lockhart was convicted of vehicular eluding, and acquitted of attempted first-degree murder and illegal discharge of a firearm. A mistrial was initially declared on the charge of attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer, although he was subsequently convicted on June 26 in a retrial.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_6": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the early hours of June 11, Lockhart shot from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle through the rear window of a sport utility vehicle driven by Faustino Garcia in a road rage incident in Greeley, before also firing at and hitting a pursuing police cruiser near Colorado State Highway 60 in Milliken.

Dozens of shots were fired over a four-block area, and the suspects fled the scene before police arrived. Among the wounded was Ryan McPhearson, a member of a band playing in the bar that night who was hospitalized in critical condition with a brain injury after he was hit in the back of the head by an unknown assailant as he attempted to assist an injured man. Lawsuits against the police. The Hells Angels' Denver chapter clubhouse, located in the city's Highlands neighborhood, was raided by the Denver Police Department (DPD) on July 31, 2001, and three club members were arrested. One was convicted of disobeying a lawful order, while charges were dismissed against the other two. In July 2002, eleven plaintiffs \u2013 ten HAMC members and the owner of the building housing the club's headquarters \u2013 filed a federal lawsuit as a result of the warrantless search, alleging that police acted illegally and violated their constitutional rights. The Denver City Council approved a $50,000 settlement in September 2003 with eighteen claimants \u2013 the original eleven petitioners in addition to seven other Hells Angels who were detained  at a motorcycle swap meet in early 2003. Denver police chief Gerry Whitman also wrote the club a letter of apology.Hells Angels members Shiloh Frazier and Todd Zahn were arrested for possession of handguns after eight club members were pulled over by police for allegedly speeding while riding their motorcycles in Denver on September 2, 2005. Zahn pleaded guilty to possession of weapon by a previous offender, and charges against Frazier were dismissed. According to a federal lawsuit filed by the group in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on August 31, 2007, alleging an unconstitutional traffic stop and search without probable cause, the bikers were held at gunpoint and handcuffed, while dozens of police officers, including a SWAT team, and a police helicopter arrived at the scene after the officer who made the traffic stop called for reinforcements. On January 24, 2008, the police departments of Denver and adjacent Mountain View settled the lawsuit with a $14,000 payment, with Denver Manager of Safety Al LaCabe and Mountain View police chief Eric Gomez also signing apologies.HAMC member Anthony Mills filed a federal lawsuit in April 2020 against city of Greeley, the town of LaSalle and the Weld County Sheriff's Office, as well as individual officers from those jurisdictions and from the Kersey and Garden City police departments in response to an April 8, 2018 incident in which LaSalle police officer David Miller joked about shooting Mills in order to get \"paid vacation\" after he had pulled him over for speeding.

One HAMC member summed up the public's feelings in an interview:. \"As far as what we view as the excessive law enforcement build-up that's always present at our events, they've made it clear to us that they don't want motorcycle clubs in Porter County ...

The deposit bag contained about $4000 in cash and was not taken. Three members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang; Steven Wayne Yee, Mark Verdi, and John Ray Bonds were carrying out a hit. The Cleveland Hells Angels were planning to retaliate against a Sandusky Outlaw gang member for the Joliet, IL shooting of a Hells Angels member the previous year, at which Bonds had been present.
