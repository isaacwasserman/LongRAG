His anti-democratic ideology was manifested on numerous occasions. In the campaign for the general elections of November 1933 he made it clear that he intended to overthrow the Parliament due to its \"irremissible and sterile decrepitude\", and promised that the one that would emerge from the elections \"will be the last one with universal suffrage for many years\".

[...] Peoples that every two or three years discuss their existence, their tradition, their fundamental institutions, cannot prosper. They live predestined to destitution\", said Calvo Sotelo. As an alternative to the \"liberal democratic State\", which \"cannot solve the Spanish problem\", he proposed the implementation of a \"corporative and authoritarian State\".The Republican Left deputy Mariano Ans\u00f3 described Calvo Sotelo as \"the most characterized enemy of the regime\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_2": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The then editor of the monarchist newspaper ABC, Luis de Galinsoga, recalled twenty-four years after his assassination in an article \"his unwavering determination to go to the last consequence of his combativeness against the Republic; which he had abhorred from its very origin and with which he never compromised, not even at the moments when the Republic seemed to dress up in sheep's clothing\".

There was frequent shouting, interruptions and incidents. The most serious moment took place when, after Calvo Sotelo's intervention, which was interrupted, as was customary, on numerous occasions, the Socialist deputy \u00c1ngel Galarza, a member of the Socialist caballerist party, made a threat to the monarchist leader which was not at all veiled.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_9": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "After vehemently protesting that in the Cortes one could make apologies for fascism, as, in his opinion, Calvo Sotelo had just done \u2014he had said, for example, that \"political parties are chlorotic confraternities of congressmen\" and that the solution to the problems \"will be found in a corporate State\"\u2014, he said that against Calvo Sotelo \"I find everything justified, even personal attacks\" (these words were not recorded in the Journal of Sessions by order of the President of the Chamber, but they were picked up by some newspapers). A journalist present in the Chamber transcribed Galarza's intervention as follows:. ...the speaker is surprised that he comes to speak to Parliament in favor of the independence of justice who, like Mr. Calvo Sotelo, has participated in the seven years of dictatorship, that his party and, in general, all the socialist groups are enemies of personal violence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_10": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Calvo Sotelo, has participated in the seven years of dictatorship, that his party and, in general, all the socialist groups are enemies of personal violence.

Galarza's speech was applauded by his party colleagues, but the president of the Cortes, Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio, visibly indignant, immediately intervened to reply: \"Violence, Mr. Galarza, is not legitimate at any time or in any place; but if in any part that illegitimacy goes up a notch, it is here. From here, from the Parliament, violence cannot be advised. The words of Your Honor, as far as that is concerned, will not be recorded in the Journal of Sessions\".

An assessment that is fully shared by Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00edn Ramos who highlights the following phrase from Calvo Sotelo's speech: \"The cause is not of the Government, the cause is superior. It is of the State.

A similar position is held by the historians Julio Ar\u00f3stegui and Paul Preston.For his part, the Italian historian Gabriele Ranzato, who does not subscribe to the thesis of the existence of a right wing agitation campaign that \"justified\" the coup, has pointed to Calvo Sotelo as one of those \"responsible for the violence that was tearing the country apart\", due to his continuous calls for the intervention of the army, a \"solution of force\" \"desired, favored, plotted and supported by him since the birth of the Republic, of which he had always declared himself an open enemy\". \"He was and remained to the end a declared enemy of the democracy brought by the Republic.

He then tried to locate Vice President Luis Jim\u00e9nez de As\u00faa, but was unsuccessful.

Commissioner Aparicio also confirms this and Alonso Mallol orders that the morgue and the area around the cemetery be cordoned off by the Civil Guard (and not by the Assault Guard to avoid tensions and incidents). Alonso Mallol communicates the news to the government, which at that moment is in session. Without knowing that the body had been found, Calvo Sotelo's brothers arrive at the cemetery, accompanied by Paco Grondona, brother-in-law of the disappeared, and the monarchist deputies Andr\u00e9s Amado and Pedro Sainz Rodr\u00edguez.

The driver Bayo Cambronero was condemned to death, but the death penalty was commuted to thirty years in prison. He spent seven or eight years in Porlier prison and was later released.Ian Gibson concludes: \"at the end of the war, then, that crime had not been thoroughly investigated. Nor did Franco's judges succeed in clearing it up\". Gibson points out that there is no evidence that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was planned before the attack on Lieutenant Castillo, nor that the Republican Government was implicated.

After the exhaustive research he carried out for his book La noche en que mataron a Calvo Sotelo (The night Calvo Sotelo was killed), published in 1982, Gibson believes that there is no doubt that it was premeditated. He provides as evidence, first of all, the letter that the then artillery lieutenant Urbano Orad de la Torre sent in 1978 to the newspaper El Pa\u00eds in which he stated that in a meeting of UMRA officers, to which he also belonged, it was decided to assassinate a prominent right wing leader in retaliation for the murder of Lieutenant Castillo, also a member of the UMRA, and in fulfillment of the threat that Orad de la Torre himself had made to the members of the right wing Spanish Military Union after the murder of Captain Carlos Faraudo, also a member of the UMRA.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_73": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Secondly, Gibson considers that the complicity of Captain Cond\u00e9s is proven because \"we find it quite difficult to believe that, upon hearing the shots fired by the captain of the Civil Guard, he did not immediately order the van to stop.\" \"Overwhelmed by the death of his friend Castillo and convinced of the imminence of the \"fascist\" uprising, would it be surprising that he agreed with Luis Cuenca, a well-known gunman, so that the latter would carry out the fatal shots, while he directed the operation?

The Minister of the Interior had just told them: \"I do not yet have an account of the event, because I have not yet been able to take care of it\".The afternoon newspapers hit the streets with blank spaces which have been suppressed by censorship. The government, under the state of alarm which has been in force since the February elections, has decided to redouble its censorship to avoid the use of the word \"assassination\" to describe the death of Calvo Sotelo and to prevent the intervention of the forces of law and order in the death of Calvo Sotelo.

La \u00c9poca would never reappear, after almost a century of existence. El D\u00eda in Alicante and El Lunes in Oviedo were also suspended for evading censorship.Early in the evening, when the second part of the Council of Ministers' meeting, which had resumed at six o'clock in the afternoon, ended, a brief note was issued. Instead of including a resounding condemnation of the assassination of one of the two main opposition leaders and committing to arrest and bring to justice the culprits \u2014neither Luis Cuenca nor Fernando Cond\u00e9s were ever arrested\u2014, the note limits itself to condemning and equating (which Gil-Robles complained about) the assassinations of both Calvo Sotelo and Lieutenant Castillo (\"The Council of Ministers, in view of the acts of violence which have culminated in the death of the Security officer Mr. Castillo and the deputy to Cortes Mr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_79": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Castillo and the deputy to Cortes Mr. Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, facts of notorious gravity, and for the execration of which it must formulate the most sincere and ardent protests, it believes it is appropriate to make a public statement to the effect that it will immediately proceed with the greatest energy and the clearest severity, within the precepts of the law of Public Order, to take all those measures demanded by the need to maintain the spirit of coexistence among Spaniards and the elementary respect for the rights of human life\") and to inform of the appointment of a special judge for each case, both magistrates of the Supreme Court (Enrique Iglesias Portal for that of Calvo Sotelo and S\u00e1nchez Orbeta for that of Castillo).

Furthermore, the absence of a categorical statement by the President of the Government could reinforce the idea spread in right wing circles that he personally was behind the assassination, based on the alleged death threat that Casares Quiroga had made to Calvo Sotelo on June 16 in the Cortes (\"It is lawful for me to say after what Your Honor has done today before Parliament, of any case that might occur, which will not occur, I will hold Your Honor responsible before the country.\"), although the following day no newspaper interpreted Casares Quiroga's words in that sense.

The Socialists, for their part, according to Alfonso Bull\u00f3n de Mendonza, were very interested in preventing the details of the assassination from becoming known, because if they came to light \"the image of the party would be very damaged\" (\"one of the chiefs of La Motorizada had led the group that appeared at Calvo Sotelo's house and... one of Prieto's bodyguards had assassinated the monarchist leader\").", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_87": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Shortly before midnight on Monday the 13th, prominent leaders of the PSOE (Indalecio Prieto, Juan Sime\u00f3n Vidarte), the UGT (Manuel Lois Fern\u00e1ndez), the JSU (Santiago Carrillo), the PCE (Vicente Uribe) and the Casa de Pueblo in Madrid (Edmundo Dom\u00ednguez) presented themselves at the Ministry of War, where the President of the Government Casares Quiroga had his office (since in addition to the Presidency he held that portfolio), the JSU (Santiago Carrillo), the PCE (Vicente Uribe) and the Casa del Pueblo in Madrid (Edmundo Dom\u00ednguez) to offer him all their support if the military uprising that everyone thought was imminent took place, which Casares Quiroga was grateful for, but he gave no importance to the rumors about the possible military coup.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_88": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Hours later, in the early hours of Tuesday the 14th, these organizations (the CNT had not been invited to the meeting they held) made public a joint note, which according to Luis Romero \"ties the hands of the ministers a little in the face of the clarification of the facts and conditions, to some extent, their actions in the face of them\":.

Alfonso Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza also uses this testimony from Gibson's book \u2014which he also quotes\u2014 to support his conjecture that \"it is even possible that [Prieto] obstructed the investigation\". And then Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza refers to the interpretation of this fact by the revisionist P\u00edo Moa, who has gone so far as to affirm that Indalecio Prieto was behind the assassination of Calvo Sotelo: \"If true, this relationship would prove that if the government of Casares Quiroga did not take more spectacular measures against the assassins of Calvo Sotelo it was because it was prevented by pressure from the PSOE, and in such a case Prieto's responsibility in the unleashing of the civil war would be hardly exaggerated, since he would have prevented the only indicative to the right that Casares Quiroga was willing to make.\" In reality what Lieutenant Le\u00f3n Lupi\u00f3n intended by relating the confrontation between Casares Quiroga and Prieto was to demonstrate that the government was not involved in the assassination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_93": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In reality what Lieutenant Le\u00f3n Lupi\u00f3n intended by relating the confrontation between Casares Quiroga and Prieto was to demonstrate that the government was not involved in the assassination. \"A man who takes this position [Casares Quiroga] is not a man committed to the crime,\" he had also told Ian Gibson, who, on the other hand, makes no interpretation of what the lieutenant has told him.Casares Quiroga even presented his resignation to the President of the Republic, Aza\u00f1a, but the latter did not accept it, alleging that to do so would be like acknowledging that he had had some responsibility in the crime. Aza\u00f1a did not heed the advice given to him by Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio, President of the Cortes, that he should immediately change the government, that he should act against the right and against the extreme left \"with harsh sanctions that would show the recovery of all the levers of power.

In the meeting held by the Government in the National Palace at noon on Thursday 16th presided over by Aza\u00f1a, some ministers expressed themselves in favor of giving entry into the cabinet to some centrist personality in order to contribute to the appeasement that the country needed. They also expressed their concern for the infiltration of the State apparatus, as had been made clear by the assassination of Calvo Sotelo. Response from the left.

Alfonso Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza notes the same thing with nuances: he was \"one of the few leaders of the left who seems to have sincerely felt sorry for the homicide\". As soon as he heard the news of the discovery of Calvo Sotelo's body he asked the Count of Vallellano to go immediately to his house. When the latter arrived, accompanied by other deputies of the monarchist minority, Mart\u00ednez Barrio told him in tears and in a broken voice: \"For the same reasons as you and many others that will not escape your perspicacity, no one but me deplores this stain that falls on the Republic, and whose consequences no one can foresee to what extent they will reach\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_96": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "A journalist of the Catholic newspaper El Debate who spoke with him shortly afterwards wrote that he was \"truly overwhelmed by the event\".Mart\u00ednez Barrio did not put on the same level the assassination of Calvo Sotelo, whose figure he publicly praised, and that of Lieutenant Castillo, as did most of the rest of the leaders of the left, and refrained from establishing a causal relationship between the two crimes. He was also one of the few politicians of the Popular Front who was aware that the assassination and its circumstances made it necessary to change the policy followed until then by the left. This is how he put it privately to the President of the Republic, Manuel Aza\u00f1a. He told him that he believed it was necessary to form a new government ready to impose \"harsh sanctions that would show the recovery of all the levers of power\". In order to avoid breaking the Popular Front Mart\u00ednez Barrio did not clearly state what he thought, but he did so in a veiled way when on the night of the 13th he told journalists (which also implied a criticism of the government): \"It is not possible for citizens to see that the State does not guarantee their security.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_97": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "We must all do our part to put an end to the situation that this event reveals...\". The newspaper La Vanguardia in its edition of the following day put it more clearly: \"Either a guiding Government finally rises in Spain, a Government that truly governs, imposing itself and disarming everyone, or the torrential waters of anarchy will swell and rise until they submerge us in a wave of barbarism\". For his part, Antoni Rovira i Virgili wrote in La Humanitat, the press organ of the Republican Left of Catalonia: \"Let the rulers vigorously enforce compliance with the laws. But let there be order in the streets, in the workplaces and in the homes. Let there be an authentic Republic and not a mess with violence and the blood from crimes.\" Another left wing Republican politician who was aware of the seriousness and implications of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was Mariano Ans\u00f3, who in his memoirs wrote: \"After the revolutionary movement of Catalonia and Asturias, this crime was the greatest attack committed against the Republic.

He was the only left wing Republican politician who roundly and publicly condemned the crime \u2014he had been a fellow student of Calvo Sotelo\u2014 saying that \"the Republic had been disgraced forever\". He was also one of the few who offered his condolences to the family. However, when another left wing Republican, Rafael S\u00e1nchez Guerra, went to Calvo Sotelo's home to sign the condolence sheets that had been placed in the doorway, he was booed and rejected.

In the immediate post-war period, the socialist Juli\u00e1n Zugazagoitia, then editor of the newspaper El Socialista, recognized that the assassination of Calvo Sotelo had been a \"truly monstrous\" event.The pro-government Republican press highlighted the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo more than that of Calvo Sotelo, while the right wing press such as ABC and El Debate did the opposite, although in inferior conditions because the government forbade them to publish any commentary. One of the few newspapers that tried to maintain a certain balance was Ahora, which published photographs of the two victims on its front page and in the inside pages described the two deaths as \"abominable crimes\".Pol\u00edtica, the unofficial organ of Republican Left, put on the front page in large font accompanied by an image \"The Assault Lieutenant Don Jos\u00e9 Castillo murdered by gunmen\", while dedicating a small headline at the bottom of the page to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo which read: \"Violent death of Mr. Calvo Sotelo.

El Liberal said in its editorial dedicated to the two murders: \"If they do what they do when they are in the opposition, what would they not do when they are in power?

La Libertad wrote: \"We do not accept violence, but neither do we tolerate the murder of the people, drowning them in waves of tyranny and misery\".The socialist caballerist newspaper Claridad devoted its entire front page to the assassination of Lieutenant Castillo and the assassination of Calvo Sotelo was relegated to the last page, devoting only a few lines to it. Much further went the also caballerist El Obrero de la Tierra of July 18 \u2014without having had time to cover in its pages the previous day's uprising of the army in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco\u2014 since it justified the assassination of Calvo Sotelo by affirming that his death had been the \"logical consequence of these latest fascist criminal attacks\" carried out by \"the mercenary gangs for hire of reaction\", and then called for the organization of the \"Popular Militias\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_102": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_102", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "To the cadres of the socialist militias he urged them to maintain \"constant communication among themselves to help each other and to concentrate wherever necessary in order to inexorably crush fascism, as soon as it wants to begin its announced uprising against the Republic and the workers\".

And before that happens it is better for theirs to flow than ours\".Even more radical was the response of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), whose secretary general Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, a week earlier, had already criticized the government for making \"concessions to the enemy, driven by an absurd desire for coexistence\".

In the joint note which was made public in the early hours of Tuesday, July 14, support was offered to the government for the \"defense of the regime\".

As soon as Francisco Largo Caballero and the rest of the members of the UGT leadership who had traveled to London to attend the Socialist International Trade Union Congress arrived in Madrid that same Tuesday 14th in the afternoon, they stated that they did not express their solidarity with the joint note signed by the member of the executive that had remained in Spain. The reason was that the caballerists did not recognize the PSOE Executive Committee controlled by the centrists, which they considered \"factious\". They finally agreed to meet with the PSOE executive and the rest of the workers' organizations of the Popular Front on July 16, one day before the military uprising began, so as not to overrule their representative at the first meeting, but the UGT envoy stated that he could not make any agreement without consulting his executive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_107": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In the document which was finally approved, with the abstention of the UGT, it was urged to prepare workers' committees throughout Spain to organize \"popular militias\", to ask the government for weapons for them and to purge the military.

The then editor of the newspaper El Socialista and deputy Juli\u00e1n Zugazagoitia, of the prietist sector, recalled in exile immediately after the end of the war that \"among my colleagues there was no unanimity in judging the attack. I heard from one of them the following opinion: \u2014The death of Calvo Sotelo gives me neither sorrow nor joy.

The same confidence had been shown a few days earlier by the leader of the radical sector of the PSOE, Francisco Largo Caballero, who at a rally held in Madrid before traveling to London had said: \"If they want to give themselves the pleasure of staging a coup d'etat by surprise, let them do it... The working class cannot be defeated.\" During his stay in London, Largo Caballero had reiterated in a statement to the News Chronicle (the article was titled: \"Interview with one of the most important men in Spain today, who perhaps will become as famous as Lenin\") the political strategy he had conceived since he agreed to join the Popular Front: \"When it [the Republican Government] fails we will replace it and then it will be our program and not theirs that will be carried out.\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_110": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "He also gave another interview to the Daily Express in which he was called the \"Spanish Lenin\".

[...] It seems to me that we are entering the most dramatic phase of the Republic. Either our dictatorship comes or the other\".The funeral of Lieutenant Castillo, which took place in the civil cemetery of Madrid on the morning of Tuesday, July 14, was a great demonstration of the strength of the workers' organizations. \"The threat of an uprising against the Republic weighed that morning on all the spirits,\" recalled many years later a young medical student, a Socialist sympathizer, who attended the funeral.

The family received countless telegrams of condolences from all over, funerals were held in many localities, black ribbons were hung, and thousands of people came to the doorway of Calvo Sotelo's home at 89 Vel\u00e1zquez Street or to the headquarters of Spanish Renovation to sign on the sheets of paper that had been prepared to protest the assassination.

The conservative press, both in the capital and outside Madrid, dedicated ample space to the news, although with the limitations imposed by the censorship ordered by the government. El Pueblo Manchego, a Catholic newspaper of Ciudad Real, published an editorial on July 15 in which it asked \"What is going to happen here?\" and affirmed: \"We are at war. Whoever doubts it does not know how to see or understand the realities of Spain\". He then raised the need to form a \"National Front\". \"It is so because the life of Spain is seriously threatened\" and \"to resist the revolutionary push... and to defeat it\".

May God mercifully welcome the martyred soul of the homeland, which may serve as an example to its last defenders\").The liberal sectors that had supported the Republic were also shocked, especially by the lack of response from the government. Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, one of the former members of the Association in the Service of the Republic, wrote to Marcelino Domingo on the 16th: \"The Government gives the impression of incredible leniency, it makes us who fought against the Monarchy blush and outraged.

Among many centrist or conservative leaders the idea was installed that the state was not capable of controlling its security forces, even if it wanted to do so. \"Lerroux, or Camb\u00f3, or even Gil-Robles, thought that from then on they could not be loyal to a state that could not guarantee their lives.

The Minister of the Interior, Juan Moles, also intervened briefly, who instead of \"clarifying at least all the aspects relating to the role played \u2014before, during and after the events\u2014 by the police forces\", limited himself to saying that several members of the Assault Guard had been arrested and separated from service, without giving further details.

According to Alfonso Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza, Prieto \"lost a wonderful opportunity to keep quiet\" because his speech was an extreme example of \"cynicism\", since, according to this historian, from the very day of the assassination Prieto already knew who had assassinated Calvo Sotelo and was covering up for them. Addressing Gil-Robles, Prieto again resorted to the argument of the left that the violence of that moment was the consequence of \"the enormous ferocities committed on the occasion of the repression of the events of October 1934\": \"You did not calculate then that you had sown a plant whose poison would also reach you.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_142": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_142", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "None of us has approved of the events that are now taking place, we condemn and deplore them... but... your honor has no right to believe your hands are totally clean and clean of responsibility while you strive to muddy those of others\".

He also addressed the Government: \"One good forewit is worth two afterwits and a forearmed Government is worth forty\" (Spanish: Hombre prevenido vale por dos y el Gobierno prevenido vale por cuarenta). Three days later, on July 12, the eve of Calvo Sotelo's assassination, he had reiterated, again in El Liberal: \"Be sure that in launching themselves ['those who from the adversary camp prepare the attack'] they are risking everything, absolutely everything.

On the other hand, he accuses the Government of lukewarmness by \"falling short, by not getting to the bottom of the elements responsible for the civil war in Spain\", among which he points directly to the CEDA. He ended by addressing the right wing deputies: \"Here we are, the workers' forces in the first place, to support the Government, and then to prevent your attempts to lead Spain to catastrophe from succeeding\".The following speaker was the centrist Manuel Portela Valladares who, according to Luis Romero, \"is perhaps the only speaker who remains neutral\". He stated that he would not support the extension of the state of alarm because, having declared himself a belligerent, the Government would not be able to apply it \"with serenity, with moderation, without passion, with equality\". For his part, the Lliga deputy Joan Ventosa launched an \"unmerciful, although realistic\" attack against the President of the Government Casares Quiroga whom he considered the least suitable person \"to reestablish civil coexistence among the Spanish and to put an end to the existing civil war\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_147": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_147", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Like the monarchists and Gil-Robles, he also recalls \"the [parliamentary] tumults produced by elements that form part of the government minority, from which insults, slander, attacks and incitements to personal attacks have constantly come from\".

Ventonsa ended by saying that he would not support the extension of the state of alarm. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cid, of the Spanish Agrarian Party, then intervened, recalling the threat made in Parliament against Calvo Sotelo by the Socialist deputy \u00c1ngel Galarza (a threat which had also been alluded to, without naming the deputy, in the declaration of the monarchists).

He returned by car to Biarritz from where he had come as soon as he learned of the assassination of Calvo Sotelo.That same day in the afternoon, the socialist caballerist newspaper Claridad responded to Gil-Robles' affirmation, in threatening and ironic tones, that the state of alarm had not served to put an end to violence: \"If the state of alarm cannot subdue the right wing, let a dictatorship of the Popular Front come as soon as possible.

The article conveyed the confidence of the Socialists of all tendencies, and the working class left in general, that the \"proletariat\" would be capable of winning in a foreseeable civil war which they estimated to be short-lived. Consequences. Impact on the military. The assassination of Calvo Sotelo provoked the last indecisive or indifferent military men to join the rebellion, giving it the definitive impetus. Among the military already committed to the conspiracy, the assassination and its circumstances so excited the spirits that General Mola had to travel on the 14th from Pamplona to Logro\u00f1o to prevent the clandestine Spanish Military Union (UME) from revolting, together with Phalanx, on the 16th.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_150": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_150", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "In addition, several military men even prepared a plot to kidnap the President of the Republic Manuel Aza\u00f1a, which was finally discarded due to the imminence of the uprising.Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez Calleja has pointed out that \"the assassination did not provoke the military uprising, but it increased the determination of the conspirators and encouraged those who still hesitated to participate in the uprising that was being prepared to take the step\".

The Italian historian Gabriele Ranzato has pointed out that what the assassination of Calvo Sotelo revealed was that \"the State of the Popular Front, instead of limiting itself to pursuing and striking down with the law the instigators, promoters and executors of subversive violence, using all its legal repressive resources, had, on the other hand, allowed summary justice \u2014or rather summary vengeance\u2014, and moreover against one of the most eminent figures of the opposition, by members of its forces of order, without, on the other hand, taking immediate and severe measures against them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_163": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_163", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "This had led to an obfuscation of the rule of law, capable of engendering great insecurity in many disconcerted citizens...\".Joan Maria Thom\u00e0s agrees with Ranzato when he states that \"the most important thing was the government's lack of reaction to the assassination of the ultra-right winger and congressman, which did not act energetically to reestablish order and disappointed those sectors that were clamoring for a change of direction.A similar assessment is made by Alfonso Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza, but he goes further by arguing that the Government could have avoided the civil war with a forceful action. \"Although there are many sources of the time that point to the assassination of Calvo Sotelo as the point of no return towards civil war, we believe that the conflict could still have been avoided. Everything depended on the attitude taken by the Government, because if it reacted with unprecedented forcefulness to the unprecedented fact that a National Deputy was assassinated with the collaboration of the State Security Forces, it is quite possible that it would have managed to convince a large sector of Spanish society (conspirators included) that order was finally going to be reestablished.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_164": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_164", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Bull\u00f3n de Mendoza also states that \"had it not been for the impact of his death, it is quite possible that [the National Uprising] would not have been, as the Government supposed, a new 'sanjurjada'\".In 1965 the American historian Gabriel Jackson already pointed out that \"for anyone who was not a blind supporter of the left it was intolerable that a leader of the opposition should be assassinated by uniformed officers driving a Government vehicle\", although he added that \"it was equally intolerable that the Phalanx and the UME should conduct with impunity a campaign of terror against leftist officers\". In this way he equated the murders of Lieutenant del Castillo and Calvo Sotelo which he said both \"horrified public opinion much more than any of the numerous disorders and occasional deaths since February\".Stanley G.

First, it was carried out by a brigade with a mixture of police and militia.... Cond\u00e9s invoked his authority to convince the politician to accompany the assassins in the dead of night. This modus operandi would be used on countless occasions during the following four months.

The rebel side used the assassination of Calvo Sotelo to justify and legitimize the coup d'\u00e9tat of July 1936 and directly accused the government of the Republic of crime. This is what General Franco said on April 19, 1938: \"That Regime died definitively that sad dawn in which a seductive Government, acting as the executing arm of Freemasonry, plotted and carried out, through its agents, the vile assassination of the Chief of the parliamentary opposition and great patrician: Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo\".

One of the \"proofs\" adduced by the Commission was that the Government of the Republic was behind the assassins of Calvo Sotelo. To prove it, they provided testimonies whose veracity historians doubt today. As Ian Gibson has pointed out, the members of the Commission \"made a special effort to locate people who supported the thesis, or dogma, that the assassination had been \"a scandalous State crime\".

The monarchist Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix de Lequerica wrote on July 11, 1937, in El Ideal Gallego an article entitled \"The last afternoon with Calvo Sotelo\" in which he narrated the meeting he had with him and other monarchist deputies in a picnic area on the outskirts of Madrid to have tea just a year before, on Saturday afternoon, July 11, 1936 \u2014a day and a half later he would be assassinated\u2014. In the article he said the following:.

People looked at him with expectation. The dancing couples were absent for a while from their chatter to turn their eyes to the key politician of all illusions. The conversation was fast, funny and naturally a little malicious. Calvo laughed a lot and celebrated with great childishness the witticisms of each one. In the midst of the pain we were happy and sure of victory.. Twenty-three years later, July 17, 1960, Luis de Galinsoga, director of the monarchist newspaper ABC when he was assassinated, published an article in the same newspaper entitled \"Conciencia de m\u00e1rtir en Calvo Sotelo\" (Martyr's conscience in Calvo Sotelo). Among other things it said:. RETREATED in a Celtiberian unconsciousness, people were happily sipping their horchata or their beer on the terraces of Madrid's caf\u00e9s.

That man's name was Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo.. His friends were not unaware that he was fully aware of the danger that surrounded him. One of us, Joaqu\u00edn Bau, heard it this way from the tribune when crossing one afternoon, in the middle of the daze, and the unconsciousness of the matter, the Gran V\u00eda in Madrid: \"These people will not react until they kill me\".

Every day, every evening, his words became more trembling and more fiery in that seat of the Congress on which converged in an impudent flood the rude imprecations, the insults, the cynical threats of a majority recruited among outlaws and gunmen.

A profound lesson of historical consequences, because it is not a bad thing for the people to always have a handhold of hope to hold on to in desperate times, like an anchor that saves them from shipwreck. In that tragic hour of Spain, that anchor was called Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo. And the anchor of salvation was his death, at the same time glorious and infamous. Because on one side, that of the victim, his sacrifice was sublime and odd, but on the side of the victimizers, the State crime perpetrated on Calvo Sotelo in the livid light of dawn, in Vel\u00e1zquez Street, inaugurated, as Caudillo Franco has recalled several times, a whole system and a whole school of common crime, of executions from the Power applied to politics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_178": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_178", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Calvo Sotelo knew that his life was the initial price of the reaction of Spain in defense of itself and, by key, of the whole West.... Four days earlier, on July 13, 1960 (the twenty-fourth anniversary of the assassination), General Franco inaugurated the Monument to Calvo Sotelo  in the Plaza de Castilla in Madrid. In his speech he said:. The death of Calvo Sotelo by the very agents in charge of security was the palpable demonstration that, with the brakes broken, the Nation was hurtling vertiginously towards communism. There was no longer any room for doubt or hesitation: the assassination, orchestrated from the Power, of the most prominent leader of the opposition, united all Spaniards in a unanimous and fervent yearning to save Spain. Without the sacrifice of Calvo Sotelo, the fate of the National Movement could have been very different. His treacherous death overcame the natural scruples of the patriots, marking them the path of an unavoidable duty. .   Al\u00eda Miranda, Francisco (2011). Julio de 1936.
