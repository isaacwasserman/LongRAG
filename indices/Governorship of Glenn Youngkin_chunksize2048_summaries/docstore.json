His actions included banning \"inherently divisive concepts\" such as critical race theory in schools, lifting mask mandates and vaccine requirements, and creating commissions to combat antisemitism and human trafficking. These orders were more controversial than those of recent predecessors.

Youngkin assembled his cabinet slowly, with many nominees being women, African American, or from other states, and few having prior government experience. This caused speculation and anticipation among lobbyists and interest groups. Youngkin's focus on education was reflected in his decision to begin announcing his cabinet nominees with his choice for Secretary of Education. His initial nominee for Secretary of Natural Resources, Andrew Wheeler, was voted down in the State Senate and later appointed as a senior advisor and then director of the Office of Regulatory Management. His nomination sparked conflict between Youngkin and Democratic state legislators, leading to more vetoes by Youngkin during the 2022 legislative session than any of his immediate predecessors had done during their own first years in office.

Democrats retaliated by rejecting some of Youngkin's nominees. This dispute escalated into more vetoes by Youngkin during the 2022 legislative session than any of his predecessors, with all vetoed bills being sponsored by Democrats and having passed with bipartisan support. Youngkin's use of unpaid advisors, Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne, also drew scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In terms of abortion, Youngkin introduced a failed amendment to the state budget that would have banned state funding for abortion services in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, and he has since expressed support for restricting abortion access in Virginia. Regarding COVID-19, Youngkin supports the vaccination effort but opposes mask and vaccine mandates. He has challenged the Biden administration's employer vaccine mandate and opposed adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required immunizations for school children.

Youngkin limited an early release program for inmates, making inmates convicted of violent crimes ineligible for the expanded program.\n\nDuring his campaign, Youngkin proposed eliminating Virginia's individual income tax, which received criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Later, he announced a series of more modest tax cut proposals, including eliminating the grocery tax, suspending the gas tax increase, and offering a one-time rebate on income tax. Youngkin's campaign hired Stephen Moore, who had helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas, which were later seen as a failure.

However, some of his tax policies, like suspending the gas tax and requiring localities to lower real estate tax rates if real estate values rise, were blocked.\n\nYoungkin's administration has also focused on modernizing the Virginia Employment Commission and expanding broadband access. He opposes the gradual minimum wage increase and supports Virginia's right-to-work law, while being critical of collective bargaining rights for public employees and project labor agreements.\n\nIn education, Youngkin's platform was a major focus of his campaign, and he has been active in addressing cultural issues, such as opposing the teaching of critical race theory in schools.

In the legislative session, Youngkin attempted to subvert the election results of the Loudoun County School Board and repealed protections for transgender students, which is expected to face court challenges. Youngkin and his opponent, McAuliffe, both campaigned on increasing the education budget, but Youngkin's education platform was lighter on details and focused on cultural issues.

In contrast to his Democratic predecessors, he has been critical of protections for transgender students and has taken steps to roll them back. Before leaving office, outgoing Governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennial education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, with a focus on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing in STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing achievement gaps. McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee, called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually and criticized Youngkin for not releasing budget details until late in the campaign. Youngkin eventually proposed $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.

This budget included a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years, one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers, and $1.25 billion for school construction and maintenance. Youngkin also expanded the Virginia Preschool Initiative, issued an executive order to combat Virginia's teacher shortages, and supported expanding charter schools and re-establishing lab schools in the state. Additionally, he signed legislation allowing college athletes in Virginia to profit through name, image, and likeness deals and mandated all public schools in Virginia to create detailed digital floor plans of their buildings. Youngkin has also expressed his support for placing school resource officers in every school in Virginia and signed a bill requiring that all members of student organizations at colleges or universities in Virginia receive training to prevent hazing.

Regarding the environment, Youngkin does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change and has taken steps to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and block California's vehicle emissions standards. He has also issued executive orders affecting pollution permitting and single-use plastics. In healthcare, Youngkin vetoed bills related to medical debt collection and tobacco premiums. On immigration, he reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges and universities. In LGBTQ rights, Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but has said he would not interfere with the issue as governor, and he has been criticized for his lack of support for the LGBTQ+ community.
