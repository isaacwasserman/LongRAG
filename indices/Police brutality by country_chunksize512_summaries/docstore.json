There have been numerous high-profile cases of questioned police behavior, such as the G20 Toronto summit protests, the Quebec student protests, the Robert Dzieka\u0144ski Taser incident, and the shooting of Sammy Yatim. In the United States, there have been long-standing concerns about police accountability and governance, with significant issues of police brutality and excessive force. The UN Committee against Torture criticized the US for recurrent police shootings of unarmed black individuals, comparing it to historical racial terror. The UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent also highlighted the trauma caused by contemporary police killings.\n\nIn the US, several military police officers were convicted for the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in Iraq. The text emphasizes the high number of police killings in the US, with a notorious reputation for police brutality and a significantly higher rate compared to other Western countries. For example, in 2016, U.S. police killed 1,093 people, and at least 1,176 people in 2022, the deadliest year on record.

In response to the continued police violence, 17 organizations from the Black movement, human rights, and favelas organizations joined a political party to enter a petition (ADPF 635) in Brazil's Supreme Court demanding actions to minimize police terror in communities.
