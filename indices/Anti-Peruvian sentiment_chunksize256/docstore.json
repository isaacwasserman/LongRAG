Even the Chilean and Rio de la Plata governments mistrusted Bol\u00edvar, accusing him of not letting each people decide their future. Bol\u00edvar's attitude contributed to accentuate this negative climate. He was irritable and reacted violently to the slightest contradiction.

Sucre wanted to delay any union of Bolivia with Peru as long as possible (knowing that it would fall under the latter's hegemony when it passed, weakening his government), annex all the territories offered by Ortiz, confront Colombia with Peru, secure his back by agreeing with Chile and Buenos Aires, and separate Arequipa, Cuzco and Puno from Peru. All this is demonstrated when Sucre indicated to Ortiz de Zevallos that: \"only under that plan could Bolivia not fear that Peru would absorb it, as happens when a small State links up with a larger and stronger one\". As well as when in 1827, Sucre appointed dean Gregorio Funes, a Bolivarian Argentine, who was carrying out the functions of Colombian minister in Buenos Aires, to receive the post of Bolivian minister in the same Argentine capital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_132": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Through Funes, Sucre addressed the issue of an alliance between Bolivia, Argentina and Chile, which was supposedly to stop Brazilian expansionism, but in practice he was looking for support against Peru because he knew its weakness against it, and suggested that the participation of Gran Colombia in the war against Brazil could occur through a treaty. From Santiago de Chile, Andr\u00e9s Santa Cruz interpreted Sucre's opening to Buenos Aires as an attempt to form \"an anti-popular and very particularly anti-Peruvian pact.\" The negotiations did not prosper because the Peruvians also sent agents who assured that Bol\u00edvar intended to divide the continent between two great empires: one Colombian and the other Brazilian. In practice, Sucre depended so much on the orders of Bol\u00edvar that he was quickly seen by Peruvians and people of the River Plate as a puppet or bridgehead of the Liberator in the continental south, a \u201cproconsul of the Bolivian empire\u201d.\"You can't think of the multitude of papers that come from Peru to upset Bolivia.

Later, during the Gran Colombian-Peruvian War, Sucre's anti-Peruvian attitudes were denounced, who, to commemorate the triumph of the Gran Columbian army over the Peruvian advance, ordered the construction of a commemorative obelisk on the site where the battle occurred, with an inscription increasing the number of Peruvian soldiers that took part in action and decreasing their own, in the following terms:. \"The Peruvian army of 8,000 soldiers that invaded the land of their liberators, was defeated by 4,000 braves from Colombia on February 27, 1829.\".
