List was then selected for Auckland\u2019s first representative match of the season against Taranaki. The New Zealand Herald was blunt with their assessment saying \u201cList, Marist, seems to have lost all form and is lucky to gain a place.

He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end.

List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan.
