Origins. The Stowe gardens and estate are located close to the village of Stowe in Buckinghamshire, England. John Temple, a wealthy wool farmer, purchased the manor and estate in 1589. Subsequent generations of Temples inherited the estate, but it was with the succession of Sir Richard Temple that the gardens began to be developed, after the completion of a new house in 1683.Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, inherited the estate in 1697, and in 1713 was given the title Baron Cobham. During this period, both the house and the garden were redesigned and expanded, with leading architects, designers and gardeners employed to enhance the property. The installation of a variety of temples and classical features was illustrated the Temple family's wealth and status.

In the 1690s, Stowe had a modest early Baroque parterre garden, but it has not survived, as it was altered and adapted as the gardens were progressively remodelled. Within a relatively short time, Stowe became widely renowned for its magnificent gardens created by Lord Cobham. Created in three main phases, the gardens at Stowe show the development of garden design in 18th-century England. They are also the only gardens where Charles Bridgeman, William Kent, and Capability Brown all made significant contributions to the character and design.From 1711 to c.1735 Charles Bridgeman was the garden designer, whilst John Vanbrugh was the architect from c.1720 until his death in 1726.

Bridgeman was notable for the use of canalised water at Stowe.In 1731 William Kent was appointed to work with Bridgeman, whose last designs are dated 1735. After Bridgeman, Kent took over as the garden designer. Kent had already created the noted garden at Rousham House, and he and Gibbs built temples, bridges, and other garden structures, creating a less formal style of garden. Kent's masterpiece at Stowe is the innovative Elysian Fields, which were \"laid out on the latest principles of following natural lines and contours\". With its Temple of Ancient Virtue that looks across to his Temple of British Worthies, Kent's architectural work was in the newly fashionable Palladian style.In March 1741, Capability Brown was appointed head gardener and he lived in the East Boycott Pavilion.

At that time, Bridgeman's octagonal pond and 11-acre (4.5 ha) lake were extended and given a \"naturalistic\" shape. A Palladian bridge was added in 1744, probably to Gibbs's design. Brown also reputedly contrived a Grecian Valley which, despite its name, was an abstract composition of landform and woodland. He also developed the Hawkwell Field, with Gibbs's most notable building, the Gothic Temple, within.

Earl Temple, who had inherited Stowe from his uncle Lord Cobham, turned to a garden designer called Richard Woodward after Brown left. Woodward had worked at Wotton House, the Earl's previous home. The work of naturalising the landscape started by Brown was continued under Woodward and was accomplished by the mid-1750s.At the same time Earl Temple turned his attention to the various temples and monuments. He altered several of Vanburgh's and Gibbs's temples to make them conform to his taste for Neoclassical architecture. To accomplish this he employed Giovanni Battista Borra from July 1750 to c.1760.

The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human.. Another francophone guide was published by Georges-Louis Le Rouge in 1777.

In addition to the major British architects deployed, the Temples engaged a number of prominent Europeans.

It is less a garden of plants and flowers, and more a landscape of lawns, water and trees, with carefully contrived vistas and views which frequently culminate in eye-catcher structures.

The gardens progressed from a formal, structured layout, through increasing naturalisation. The planting of grasses and trees was equally deliberate, designed to lead the eyes of the visitor on to the next area, and to bring a sense of drama to the landscape.The gardens incorporate a number of architectural and horticultural \"firsts\". They are themselves considered the earliest example of the English landscape garden. Defining the borders of the park he began, Charles Bridgeman designed the first ha-ha in England, a feature that was widely imitated. Within the garden, Kent's Chinese House was perhaps England's earliest Chinoiserie building. So notable were the gardens at Stowe that they were emulated across the world. Thomas Jefferson visited, and bought the guidebooks, transporting ideas across the Atlantic for his Monticello estate.

A central element of the uniqueness of Stowe were the efforts of its owners to tell a story within, and through, the landscape. A symposium organised by the Courtauld  Institute, The Garden at War: Deception, Craft and Reason, suggests that it was not \"a garden of flowers or shrubs [but] of ideas.\" The original concept may have been derived from an essay written by Joseph Addison for the Tatler magazine. The landscape was to be a \"sermon in stone\", emphasising the perceived Whig triumphs of Reason, the Enlightenment, liberty and the Glorious Revolution, and 'British' virtues of Protestantism, empire, and curbs on absolutist monarchical power. These were to stand in contrast with the debased values of the corrupt political regime then prevailing.

Many of the temples and monuments in the garden celebrate the political ideas of the Whig party. They also include quotes by many of the writers who are part of Augustan literature, also philosophers and ideas belonging to the Age of Enlightenment. The Temple family used the construction of the Temple of Ancient Virtue, modelled on the Temple of Sibyl in Tivoli, to assert their place as a family of 'ancient virtue'. Figures depicted in the temple include Homer, Socrates, Epaminondas and Lycurgus, whose attributes are described with Latin inscriptions that promote them as \"defenders of liberty\".Richard Temple was also the leader of a political faction known as Cobham's Cubs, established as opposition to the policies of Robert Walpole.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "text_chunk_74": {"__data__": {"id_": "text_chunk_74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Part of the gardens at Stowe were altered to illustrate this rivalry: Temple erected the Temple of Modern Virtue, purposefully constructed as a ruin and located next to a decaying statue of Walpole.

The principles of the English landscape garden were unpopular with Tory supporters who, according to the historian Christopher Christie, did not approve of how they \"displayed in a very conspicuous way\" the estate and parkland. There was also concern, from commentators such as Oliver Goldsmith, that demolishing the homes of tenants was \"unacceptable and an abuse of power\".Contemporary satire reflected the role the gardens played in political life by portraying caricatures of the better-known politicians of history taking their ease in similar settings. In 1762, Lord Kames, a philosopher, commented that for the visitor the political commentary within the garden at Stowe may be \"something they guess\" rather than clearly explained. Art.

Historic importance. Stowe has a \"more remarkable collection of garden buildings than any other park in [England]\". Some forty structures remain in the garden and wider park; Elizabeth Williamson considered that the number of extant structures made Stowe unique. Of these, some 27 separate garden buildings are designated Grade I, Historic England's highest grade, denoting buildings of \"exceptional interest\". The remainder are listed at Grade II* or Grade II. The garden and surrounding park are themselves listed at Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.
