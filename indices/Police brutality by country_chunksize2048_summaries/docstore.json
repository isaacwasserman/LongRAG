In contrast, the police force in Latvia, during its period of independence before Soviet occupation, was successful in maintaining public order and security through community policing.

The decision was celebrated as a mark in the history of justice and lives in favela's struggle. However, the Rio de Janeiro police complained, and the mortality and criminality rates decreased after the suspension of police operations. In May 2021, Rio de Janeiro police killed 28 people in Jacarezinho Favela and were denounced for illegal actions.
