After his father's death in 1929, he moved to Madrid and studied law and architecture, but his education was disrupted by the Spanish Civil War. He began his architecture studies in 1945 and, due to his painting and drawing abilities, was commissioned to create murals and illustrations for architectural magazines. His first professional mural painting was completed in 1939 at the Cine F\u00edgaro in Madrid.\n\nPicardo focused on historical architecture in his early career, collaborating with architect Fernando Chueca Goitia on preservation and restoration projects. He was a signatory of the \"Manifiesto de la Alhambra\" in 1952, advocating for a Spanish modern architecture inspired by the Alhambra in Granada.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Picardo entered architectural competitions and designed various buildings, including a center for the Cofrad\u00eda de Pescadores in Altea, a small hotel on the Costa del Sol, and an apartment building near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas. He also worked on the Spanish Ministerio de Informaci\u00f3n y Turismo's Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a project in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAs an artist, Picardo created decorative mural paintings and illustrations for a best-selling textbook on Spanish architecture. He received an unusual commission in 1959 to design a Loewe fashion brand playing card pack and another games design for wooden chess pieces. The Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura recognized his contributions with the publication of \"Dibujos de Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo\" in 1960.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "summary_1": {"__data__": {"id_": "summary_1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo was highly regarded as a muralist and architect, with his drawings of buildings and architectural details featured in a popular textbook on Spanish architecture.

His contributions to architecture were recognized by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura with the publication of \"Dibujos de Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo\" in 1960. From the early 1960s to 1985, Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a project, restoring and converting historic buildings into luxury hotels. His work for Paradores is highly regarded and has influenced other architects in Spain and Portugal.\n\nAt Guadalupe, Picardo converted two ancient buildings into a Parador, preserving their original Mud\u00e9jar style and using ancient construction techniques. He set the main hospitality section in the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side to provide a dining room and guest rooms. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodeled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, and staff residences. Picardo also designed much of the furniture and internal decoration, making use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna.\n\nIn Ja\u00e9n, Picardo was commissioned to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina. He planned a simple hoster\u00eda with a dining room, lounge, service accommodation, and guest rooms on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle.

The building was designed in a simple style, with large windows to enjoy the views, and was constructed using modern materials hidden by traditional ones to give the appearance of age. The first phase of the building, completed in 1965, included 7 double guest rooms, a cafeter\u00eda, a bar, a reception area, a lounge, a restaurant, and service areas. Picardo added service rooms and 12 more guest rooms in 1969, and a further extension with 24 guest rooms in 1973, bringing the total to 43. The building was elevated to the title of Parador when the extension was completed in 1978. Picardo also designed the interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns, and coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador.

He also designed the interior, incorporating traditional Andaluc\u00edan features and ceramic tiles for decoration and explanatory texts. In Pedraza, he restored the Casa de la Inquisici\u00f3n, turning it into a hoster\u00eda with a rustic style, but the plan to expand it with neighboring buildings didn't materialize. The Pedraza Hoster\u00eda operated until 1992. At Alca\u00f1iz, Picardo converted the Palacio de los Comendadores into a Parador with 12 guest rooms, preserving the medieval design on the ground floor and making the upper floors more palatial. He also designed the interior decoration, incorporating the emblem of the Order of Calatrava. In 1975, he designed a new two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998.

In C\u00e1ceres, he transformed part of a 15th-century palace into a hoster\u00eda, preserving its medieval design while adding new elements. He also built a new wing with additional guest rooms in 1975. The palace was originally a medieval fortified residence, which had been modified over centuries with the addition of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque elements. Picardo chose a jumble of old buildings, mostly stables and coach houses, to convert into the hoster\u00eda. He preserved some of the existing structures and added new ones, using terracotta tiles, heavy timber, and medieval-style designs for windows, doors, furniture, and light fittings. The hoster\u00eda opened in 1971, and Picardo later completed additional work on the palace, including re-roofing and extending the original dining room area. The hoster\u00eda was eventually closed in 1984 and the rest of the palace was converted into a full Parador with 27 guest rooms. Picardo's original entrance, bar, and cafeteria area now form a suite in the Parador.\n\nIn 1966, Picardo was commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near Sevilla with a view to constructing another Parador. He chose the Alc\u00e1zar del Rey Don Pedro in Carmona, a ruined castle from the 14th century, and began his preparatory work in 1968. The castle had been severely damaged in earthquakes and most of its connecting walls were in ruins. Picardo chose the southeast of the vast castle area, a corner known as the Plaza de Armas, to build the Parador. He designed a typical Hispanic-Arabic layout with two central patios, one for the public area and the other for the service department. The building was constructed in vernacular form and appeared to be historic, with four floors on the south and east walls and two floors on the parade ground entrance side. The main structure of the building was formed of concrete, clad with ashlar and brickwork, and enhanced by buttresses.

The castle was initially severely damaged and had to undergo underpinning and other structural work due to movement in the ground. The castle was eventually converted into a Parador with 9 double rooms, 51 twin rooms, and 3 single rooms. Picardo also worked on the Castillo de Sig\u00fcenza, a comprehensively ruined palace-fortress, where he resolved to remodel it as totally medieval, removing all later additions and restoring the military feeling of the castle with towers and battlements.

Despite criticisms from archaeologists and historians regarding the lack of thorough archaeological research and the demolition of significant parts of monumental buildings, Picardo's work has been praised for its artistic value and contribution to Spain's tourism industry.\n\nPicardo's rebuilding projects were primarily based on his own historical and architectural research, with new extensions designed to resemble the monuments to which they were attached. His work has been described as \"false history\" and a \"convincing set design\" to evoke the historical era of interest to tourists, often the medieval period. This approach, while controversial among historians, has resulted in popular hotels, such as those at J\u00e4en, Carmona, and Sig\u00fcenza.\n\nThroughout his career, Picardo also carried out restoration works on various historical buildings, including the Catedral de C\u00e1diz, Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, Ermita del Humilladero, Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana, Palacio de Gamazo, Castillo de San Felipe, and Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca. His design for the Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March headquarters in Madrid, completed in 1975, is considered one of his best works, showcasing his ability to control proportions and spaces with ease.\n\nIn 1978, Picardo was commissioned to build a public indoor riding arena for the Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Equestre in Jerez de la Frontera, his birthplace.
