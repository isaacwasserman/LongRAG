buildings were in a ruinous state, and Picardo's task was to save the basic structures, including an \"outstanding\" staircase, and return them to their original Mud\u00e9jar style.\n\n- He used ancient Mud\u00e9jar construction techniques based on lime, clay, and wood for the reconstruction.\n\n- The main hospitality section of the Parador was set within the Colegio de Infantes, and the Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodeled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking.\n\n- Picardo also designed a large first-floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building.\n\n- Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo, and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna.\n\n- Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.\n\n- In 1981, Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms, which increased the number of guest rooms to 41.\n\n- At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and
