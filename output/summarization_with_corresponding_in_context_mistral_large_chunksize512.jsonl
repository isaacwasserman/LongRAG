Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction).

In 1966, while building the Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, Picardo was commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near the city of Sevilla in the province of the same name in Andaluc\u00eda with a view to constructing another Parador. After looking at the castle at Alcal\u00e1 de Guada\u00edra, and the palaces of \u00c9cija, he came across the ruined castle of Carmona the Alc\u00e1zar del Rey Don Pedro (also known as the Alc\u00e1zar de Arriba y Puerta de Marchena). In his subsequent report to the Ministry of Information and Tourism Picardo was enthusiastic about Carmona and provided preliminary sketch designs, which the Ministry accepted, and in 1968 he began his preparatory work.The origin of the castle is probably Muslim and Pedro I restored it in the 14th century into a lavish palace in Mud\u00e9jar style. It was used by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain during their final battles with the Moors in Granada. The castle was abandoned after being severely damaged in a 1504 earthquake whose epicentre was near Carmona and ruined even further in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Seven towers remained, but most of the connecting walls of the fortress were in ruins.. Picardo chose the southeast of the vast castle area, a corner known as the Plaza de Armas (parade ground) to build the Parador. Situated at the highest point of the town, the views were judged to be spectacular, looking far over the plains.. Picardo also resolved to position the building on the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley and overlapping the foundations of the original castle walls by such an extent that there would be space for guest rooms within the sloping walls below the Parador's ground floor.

By 1969, the castle was in a terrible state, with its military character compromised by alterations such as the conversion of towers into belfries and the addition of large windows and balconies. Picardo was tasked with analyzing the castle's condition and concluded that rebuilding the entire castle was necessary for the Parador to be constructed.

In 1964 Picardo was involved, with the Ministry of Information and Tourism, in investigating old buildings for conversion into a new Parador in the Province of Guadalajara. Possible locations were the castle at Atienza and the Casa del Cord\u00f3n, an old inn in the same town, the castle at Molina de Arag\u00f3n and the castle at Sig\u00fcenza.

The Ministry set about acquiring it the same year. The Castillo de los Obispos de Sig\u00fcenza (the Castle of the Bishops of Sig\u00fcenza) was a palace-fortress with Iberian, Roman, Visigothic and Moorish origins. It was enlarged and modified repeatedly between the 14th and 18th centuries, after which it declined and deteriorated, suffering progressive damage during the French invasion, the Carlist Wars, and finally during the Spanish Civil War when it was bombed by artillery and from the air during the Battle of Guadalajara in 1937. It was then left in ruins for over three decades.Starting in October 1969 Picardo analysed the condition of the building. \"The state of the castle could not have been more pitiful\" he wrote years later. \"Its military nature had been spoiled by converting its towers into belfries; huge windows and balconies had been opened for living quarters, particularly in the southern part of the castle which had served as the living area for the bishops; all the walls had been covered with plaster and render which hid the original stone; and an endless number of parasitic features had been patched onto it.\" The structure was without roofs and there were numerous collapses along the entire fortified enclosure walls.

The 20th century was conditioned by the convulsive political situation, with the end of the monarchy in 1931 and the arrival of the Second Republic, which ended with the Civil War and was replaced by Franco's dictatorship, until the reestablishment of the monarchy and the arrival of democracy. Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530 000 inhabitants, in 1930 they had almost doubled (1 009 000 hab), to reach between 1970 and 1980 the maximum peak (1 754 900) and by the end of the century to 1 500 000 inhabitants.With the turn of the century, a new political scenario opened up, marked by the loss of the colonies in America and Asia and the rise of the Regionalist League, led by politicians such as Francesc Camb\u00f3, Enric Prat de la Riba and the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who expressed their desire to place Barcelona on the international front line, at the level of cities such as Paris, New York, Berlin or Vienna.

The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany.

Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\u202f7. However, professor Hasan S\u00f6zbilir, Director of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\u202f6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\"."}, {"summary_score": 0.8807143327743276, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.866840419330082, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "The text discusses the aftermath of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.

The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain.

Washington State relies on hydropower for 72% of its power and sales of hydropower to both households and businesses topped $4.3 billion in 2003. Washington State has the 9th lowest cost for electricity in the US. Climate change will have a negative effect on both the supply and demand of electricity in Washington.. The biggest factors determining the effects on electricity are annual temperature changes and the change in peak snowpack melt and stream flow. A change in precipitation could also have an effect on electricity supply and demand, but dramatic changes in overall precipitation are not expected. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts a 300 megawatt (about 1% of Washington's generating capacity) reduction in electricity demands during the winter for each degree the temperature rises. Summer demands would probably increase due to more widespread need for air conditioning in order to keep homes and businesses cool, although estimates are still unknown.  Washington State's reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) means that changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows are important to the supply of electricity. Pg. 38. The available electricity supply could also be affected by climate change. Peak stream flows are in the summer.  Snowpack is likely to melt earlier in the future due to increased temperatures, thus shifting the peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer stream flow.  This would result in an increased availability of electricity in the early spring, when demand is dampened, and a decreased availability in the summer, when the demand may be highest.

An increase of 3.6 \u00b0F (2.0 \u00b0C) will cause 65% to 75% of the glaciers to disappear in 40 years. The retreat of the glaciers will help to increase the decline. Glaciers reflect the incoming light from the sun. With less glacial cover the rocks on the mountain will heat up causing the surrounding frozen ice to melt even faster. Drainage basins that use glacial runoff will also be affected. Glaciers contribute to a base level of water that runs off after all of the new snow cover has melted. The Middle Fork River is likely to see huge decreases in its water levels in the coming years due to this issue. The Middle Fork provides a large amount of drinking water to Bellingham.. Precipitation in the Cascades has begun to be altered drastically. While the level of precipitation on the Cascades has not decreased since the 1950s, it has begun to shift from snow to ice when it falls. The level of glacial runoff is also on the uptick since the 1950s. The level of water that flows into Puget Sound has decreased by 18% since 1949.. Water flows can be split up into three categories in Washington: Rain dominant, snow dominant, and transient snowmelt watersheds. The change in water falling will make snow dominant regions appear to be more like transition rivers and transition more like rain dominant. Snow dominant regions have their highest water flow several months after their highest snowfall. Due to the increase in temperature, they will change and act more like transition which has two peak flows, one in the spring due to snowmelt, and the other in the winter due to water falling as rain, not snow. The transition region now will act like rain regions which have their high points in river flows right after it rains. Agriculture. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale.  Agriculture is probably responsive to climate variability and weather extremes, such as droughts, floods, and severe storms. The forces that shape the climate are also critical to farm productivity."}]}, "correct": false}

A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice..

For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market.

The epidemic led to the establishment of new laws, including the creation of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, for imported animals in a port city.

New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.

It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor.

Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth's researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work.

Weighbridges were seldom used: it was a matter of professional pride that cattle weights were guesstimated.

He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not \u2014 namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently \u2014 as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era."}, {"summary_score": 0.8072226751161297, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.804052757110036, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "Richard Perren of Aberdeen University suggested in a 1971 essay that the live meat trade persisted during the Victorian era because the chilled meat trade was riskier, as chilled meat had to be quickly sold upon arrival at the London docks, unlike live animals.

Some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, passing it off as British-grown beef, which was priced higher.

However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice..

There were also concerns about the risks associated with the chilled meat trade, as it had to be sold promptly upon arrival at the London docks. Despite these debates, it is unclear what Victorian and Edwardian consumers truly thought of chilled beef, as taste, prejudice, and snobbery may have played a role in their perceptions.

The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.

It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it. A writer to The Times said:I know a family in this town of good position who after much anxious thought and weighing all the chances of being poisoned, &c, timorously resolved one day to try this American beef.

Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.

Its executives called the decision \"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\" and \"in effect, launching five shows.\" Conversely, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas in the 10:00 hour, and expressed concern that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted series. Citing complaints from many affiliates, which saw their late-evening newscasts drop significantly in the local ratings during The Jay Leno Show's run, NBC announced on January 10, 2010, that it would drop Leno's show from the 10:00 p.m. slot, with Zucker announcing plans to shift the program (which would have been reduced to a half-hour) into the 11:35 p.m. slot and shift its existing late night lineup (including The Tonight Show) by 30 minutes."}]}, "correct": false}

CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color.

The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.. The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS, and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35\u201345, 18\u201325 or 18\u201335."}, {"summary_score": 0.7934007619237678, "summary_rank": 3, "text_score": 0.7847924008085224, "text_rank": 2, "summary": "Following WWII, NBC's television network expanded from four stations to the East Coast and Midwest through coaxial cable.

In 1951, NBC commissioned Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera ever written for television; Menotti came up with Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts.

On the other hand, thanks to its long permanence in a fluid state, it allows for subsequent corrections.For its application, brushes, spatulas or scrapers can be used, allowing multiple textures, from thin layers and glazes to thick fillings, which produce a denser light.Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil of various mineral colors, with binders (kaolin, gypsum, gum arabic, fig latex, fish glue, candi sugar, etc.), kneaded with wax and Marseilles soap and cut into sticks. The color should be spread with a smudger, a cylinder of leather or paper used to smudge the color strokes.

Known since ancient Egypt, it has been a technique used throughout the ages, although with more intensity during the 18th and 19th centuries. As it is a wet technique, it provides great transparency, which highlights the luminous effect of the white color. Generally, the light tones are applied first, leaving spaces on the paper for the pure white; then the dark tones are applied.In acrylic paint, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents.

In turn, the shadow provides solidity and volume, while it can generate dramatic effects of various kinds.In the pictorial representation of light it is essential to distinguish its nature (natural, artificial) and to establish its origin, intensity and chromatic quality. Natural light depends on various factors, such as the season of the year, the time of day (auroral, diurnal, twilight or nocturnal light \u2014 from the moon or stars) or the weather. Artificial light, on the other hand, differs according to its origin: a candle, a torch, a fluorescent, a lamp, neon lights, etc. As for the origin, it can be focused or act in a diffuse way, without a determined origin. The chromatism of the image depends on the light, since depending on its incidence an object can have different tonalities, as well as the reflections, ambiances and shadows projected. In an illuminated image the color is considered saturated at the correct level of illumination, while the color in shadow will always have a darker tonal value and will be the one that determines the relief and volume.. Light is linked to space, so in painting it is intimately linked to perspective, the way of representing a three-dimensional space in a two-dimensional support such as painting. Thus, in linear perspective, light fulfills the function of highlighting objects, of generating volume, through modeling, in the form of luminous gradations; while in aerial perspective, the effects of light are sought as they are perceived by the spectator in the environment, as another element present in the physical reality represented. The light source can be present in the painting or not, it can have a direct or indirect origin, internal or external to the painting.

This effect was already known empirically by ancient painters. Cicero was of the opinion that painters saw more than normal people in umbris et eminentia (\"in shadows and eminences\"), that is, depth and protrusion.

Chiaroscuro was widely used in Roman painting, as denoted in the illusory architectures of the frescoes of Pompeii, although it disappeared during the Middle Ages. Vitruvius recommended as more suitable for painting the northern light, being more constant due to its low mutability in tone.

In Byzantine art, as well as in Romanesque art, which it powerfully influenced, the luminosity and splendor of shines and reflections, especially of gold and precious stones, were more valued, with a more aesthetic than pictorial component, since these shines were synonymous of beauty, of a type of beauty more spiritual than material."}]}, "correct": true}

In addition to architecture, light had a special influence on the miniature, with manuscripts illuminated with bright and brilliant colors, generally thanks to the use of pure colors (white, red, blue, green, gold and silver), which gave the image a great luminosity, without shades or chiaroscuro.

Georges de La Tour was a magnificent interpreter of artificial light, generally lamp or candle lights, with a visible and precise focus, which he used to place inside the image, emphasizing its dramatic aspect. Sometimes, in order not to dazzle, the characters placed their hands in front of the candle, creating translucent effects on the skin, which acquired a reddish tone, of great realism and that proved his virtuosity in capturing reality.

For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented.

Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n developed a somewhat sweetened tenebrism, although one of his best works, San Hugo in the refectory of the Carthusian monks (c. 1630, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) stands out for the presence of white color, with a subtle play of light and shadow that stands out for the multiplicity of intensities applied to each figure and object.In Venice, Baroque painting did not produce such exceptional figures as in the Renaissance and Mannerism, but in the work of artists such as Domenico Fetti, Johann Liss, and Bernardo Strozzi one can perceive the vibrant luminism and the enveloping atmospheres so characteristic of Venetian painting.. The Caravaggist novelties had a special echo in Holland, where the so-called Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged, a series of painters who assumed the description of reality and the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio as pictorial principles, on which they developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and the search for new compositional schemes, resulting in a painting that stands out for its optical values. Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti (\"Gerard of the Nights\"). In works such as Christ before the High Priest (1617), Nativity (1622), The Prodigal Son (1623) or The Procuress (1625), he showed great mastery in the use of artificial light, generally from candles, with one or two light sources that illuminated the scene unevenly, highlighting the most significant parts of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness."}, {"summary_score": 0.8078057286550995, "summary_rank": 3, "text_score": 0.7820285415315448, "text_rank": 27, "summary": "During the 17th century, Caravaggism greatly influenced various artists, including those in Spain, Venice, and Holland.

His style is close to tenebrism but with a more diffused light and softer contrasts between light and shadow. Rembrandt often depicted darkness in his paintings, illuminated by a ray of divine, zenithal light. His light is structural, integrated with form, color, and space, dematerializing bodies and playing with the texture of objects.

Of his Christ on the Column, Joachim von Sandrart said: \"the brightness of the candles and lights illuminates everything with a naturalness that resembles life so closely that no art has ever reached such heights\".. One of the greatest exponents of the symbolic use of light was Rembrandt, an original artist with a strong personal stamp, with a style close to tenebrism but more diffused, without the marked contrasts between light and shadow typical of the Caravaggists, but a more subtle and diffuse penumbra. According to Giovanni Arpino, Rembrandt \"invented light, not as heat, but as value. He invented light not to illuminate, but to make his world unapproachable\". In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light. Rembrandtian light is a reflection of an external force, which affects the objects causing them to radiate energy, like the retransmission of a message. Although he starts from tenebrism, his contrasts of light and shadow are not as sharp as those of Caravaggio, but he likes more a kind of golden shadows that give a mysterious air to his paintings. In Rembrandt, light was something structural, integrated in form, color and space, in such a way that it dematerializes bodies and plays with the texture of objects. It is a light that is not subject to the laws of physics, which he generally concentrates in one area of the painting, creating a glowing luminosity. In his work, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light. According to Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ne, in Rembrandt light and darkness are actually two types of light, one bright and the other dark."}]}, "correct": true}

La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind.
