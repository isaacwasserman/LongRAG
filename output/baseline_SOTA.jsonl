He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls. While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices. Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas.[275] He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade.\n\nAfter winning the election, Youngkin said that he would use an executive action to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market. Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year? this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards.\n\nIn his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.\n\nIn April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"\n\nAdditional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nOnly a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department.[285] The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental gr"], "response": " Youngkin has a mixed approach to environmental pollution and impact. He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls and has called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River and clean the Chesapeake Bay. However, he opposes certain environmental regulations, such as Virginia's Clean Economy Act and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and has taken steps to rescind a ban on single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. He also signed legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts, transferring authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality.", "correct": true}

hung by its advertising contractors and that the banner was subsequently removed within 30 minutes after the party's regional branch responded to the complaints.[222] The party also announced that it would it take legal action and unilaterally terminate its contract with the service providers behind the incident.[223][224] Opposition activist and independent MP candidate, Sanjar Boqaev, criticised the ruling Amanat party following the incident, in which he called for the party to be barred from participating in the elections, citing the legal provision within the election law in regard to its violation.[225]\nSeveral opposition candidates also had come under scrutiny by the Kazakh prosecutors, due to allegedly violating election laws as well such as independents Marat Jylanbaev,[226] Amangeldi Jahin,[226] and Jasulan Aitma?anbetov,[227] by which they were accused of illegally conducting their agitation on social media during the pre-campaign timeframe of the election and in result, faced fines and revoking of their candidacy registration.[228] Despite the punishments, the independent candidates dismissed the court's rulings, insisted that communication on social media was not legally defined as an \"agitation\".[228] Temirtas Synmetullaev, deputy candidate from Karaganda, received a fine on 2 March 2023 due to his pre-campaign Facebook posts in which he denied accusations, claiming the use of alleged photoshopping over his posted words.[229]\nThe Prosecutor General's Office of Kazakhstan issued a conclusive report on 17 March, stating 23 election law

People's Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) and writing \"Do not vote for these traitors\" underneath the caption, to which the post was criticised for its divisive language and perceived discreditation on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General's Office against ?oraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology.[281][282] ?oraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.[283]\nOn 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against ?oraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party, which if proven in court, would lead for ?oraev having his M?jilis candidacy be deregistered from the election.[284] The hearings initially set to be held from 6 March, were postponed that same day for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up.[285][286] On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found ?oraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by the court would come into force until election day on 19 March, which nevertheless allowed for ?oraev to remain as a candidate in the race and insisting as the incident being a provocation by the Kazakh government to delegitimise his candidacy.[287]", "Proposals to the Article 272 of the Criminal Code [ edit ]\nThe Senate of Kazakhstan approved a draft law \"On introduction of amendments and
