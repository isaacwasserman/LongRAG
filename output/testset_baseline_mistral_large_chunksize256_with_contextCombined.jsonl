Karmal's government was formed of his fellow Parchamites along with (pro-Taraki) Khalqists, and a number of known non-communists/leftists in various ministries.Karmal called his regime \"a new evolutionary phase of the glorious April Revolution,\" but he failed at uniting the PDPA.

received widespread attention from social media after the party's election advertisement was spotted being illegally installed on several public billboard displays in Karaganda, a day in advance by the required law.[221] In response to the backlash, the Amanat party's regional branch acknowledging the violation of the election law in an official statement, revealed that its campaign banner was hung by its advertising contractors and that the banner was subsequently removed within 30 minutes after the party's regional branch responded to the complaints.[222] The party also announced that it would it take legal action and unilaterally terminate its contract with the service providers behind the incident.[223][224] Opposition activist and independent MP candidate, Sanjar Boqaev, criticised the ruling Amanat party following the incident, in which he called for the party to be barred from participating in the elections, citing the legal provision within the election law in regard to its violation.[225]\nSeveral opposition candidates also had come under scrutiny by the Kazakh prosecutors, due to allegedly violating election laws as well such as independents Marat Jylanbaev,[226] Amangeldi Jahin,[226] and Jasulan Aitma?anbetov,[227] by which they were accused of illegally conducting their agitation on social media during the pre-campaign timeframe of the election and in result, faced fines and revoking of their candidacy registration.[228] Despite the punishments, the independent candidates dismissed the court's rulings, insisted that communication on social media was not legally defined as an \"agitation\".[228] Temirtas Synmetullaev, deputy candidate from Karaganda, received a fine on 2 March 2023 due to his pre-campaign Facebook posts in which he denied accusations, claiming the use of alleged photoshopping over his posted words.[229]\nThe Prosecutor General's Office of Kazakhstan issued a conclusive report on 17 March, stating 23 election law violations, mainly related to prohibited campaigning (such as unnamed candidates providing free taxi rides or sand- gravel mixture services), unauthorized independent polling, and distribution of anonymous or vandalizing campaign materials.[230][231][232]", "A number of candidates who were mostly independents were barred and even excluded from the national and local elections despite previously overgoing the registration requirements, mainly due to their tax noncompliances to even allegations of copyright infringements as well by the courts.[233][234] Deputy PM and Finance Minister Erulan Jamaubaev denied any political motivations for the refusals in registration of independent candidates for the election, adding that the State Revenue Committee would verify mistakes in the candidates' financial declarations.[235][236]\nCivil activist ?iger?m T?leujan originally had her candidacy rejected by the Almaty's District Election Commission No. 3 on 17 February 2023, due to her electoral registration fee being deemed not authentic as T?leujan was under investigation by the Kazakh authorities for allegedly inciting an attack on the Almaty International Airport during the January 2022 unrest.[237] In an appeal effort, T?leujan successfully won a lawsuit against the district election commission's decision in a ruling made by the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan on 27 February, thus essentially becoming a registered candidate in the election.[238] However on 11 March 2023, T?leujan was once again removed from the race by the district election commission, due to \"discrepancies\" in her tax returns.[239] Qaiyr?ali K?neev, a physician and public figure, was denied registration as an independent MP candidate on the absurd basis of leaving Kazakhstan and never returning despite having to physically lived and worked in Almaty the whole time, in which K?neev ironically demanded to be awarded and nominated for the Nobel Prize as being the world's first teleported person.[240]\nIn response to increasing pressure by the Kazakh government over its removal of independent candidates, opposition activists in a press conference on 9 March 2023 voiced their concerns over the issue, complaining about being \"illegally alienated\" from the elections and that the decision was unfounded, an allegation that was dismissed by the CEC member ?avkat ?temisov as he suggested for candidates to instead \"appeal to the court and try again to participate in the elections.\"[241] On 17 March, the CEC reported that a total of 166 complaints were filed to the courts by the removed candidates and that only six of the candidates had their registration successfully reinstated.[242] According to Asylbek Aijaryquly, member of the CEC, an \"objective decision\" regarding the removal of independent candidates will be determined by a court case.[243]\nThe frequent changes to the list of candidates posed challenges in preparing the voting ballots, as some candidates who had withdrawn from their constituent races were mistakenly included in the thousands of already printed ballots near election day.[244] In Almaty, the chairwoman of the territorial election commission, Aig\u00fcl Qalyqova, explained that election commission members were required by law to manually cross out the names of withdrawn candidates with a blue pen and leave their personal signatures next to the crossed-out columns.[245]", "Journalist and independent candidate Inga Imanbai for Electoral district No. 3 (Almaty) during her campaign announced in holding of a solitary picket in support of Ukraine for the first anniversary of Russian's invasion on 24 February 2023, in which her request was rejected by the Almaty ?kim Erbolat Dosaev for allegedly submitting her permission a day late.[246] Imanbai dismissed the moves by the akimat as \"bureaucratic delays\" being \"used as excuses\" and accused the Kazakh government of refusing its citizens in showing support for the Ukrainian people.[247] Nevertheless, Imanbai initially pledged to hold an anti-war speech instead in her election headquarters office.[248] On 27 February, Imanbai reported that she was summoned by the police due to inciting a \"national animus\" after holding a single picket protest in the office of Human Rights Bureau in Kazakhstan.[249][250] After her release from the police station, Imanbai accused the Kazakh authorities of attempting to remove her candidacy from the race due for holding pro-Ukraine views.[251]\nOn 14 March 2023, a car parade in support of M?jilis candidate Sabyrjan Qalmuhambetov for Electoral district No. 10 was held in Aktobe, in which the car drivers were forced to stop the campaign rally by the law enforcement due to Qalmuhambetov not obtaining an event permission from the city authorities. As a result, Qalmuhambetov's campaign faced investigation by the prosecutor's office due to his holding of an unsanctioned campaign rally.[252]", "\nWith the announcement of the 2023 elections, growing attacks on journalists across Kazakhstan had occurred beginning with journalist Dinara Egeubaeva, a M?jilis candidate and one of founders of the Altyn?y Qa?tar electoral alliance, faced an immediate intimidation shortly after announcing her interest in participating in the election in which a brick was thrown to her vehicle and then set on fire in the night of 14 January 2023 near her Almaty apartment.[253] The following day on 15 January, the Kazakh law enforcement detained five underaged suspects who were 15, 16, and 17 years of age in which they allegedly received orders from an unknown individual in exchange for bribes according to their own testimonies and were also accused of breaking glass door entrance at the El Media office.[254][255][256] Samal Ibraeva, chief editor of the Ulysmedia.kz, announced on 18 January 2023 that a cyberattack occurred on the site which leaked personal information of herself and family members, accusing the National Security Committee (\u016bQK) of being behind the cyberattack.[257][258] On 8 February 2023, the Ulysmedia.kz editorial office in Astana having received a box of \"raw meat and pictures of children\", to which she described the incident as \"intimidation\".[259][260] Journalist Vadim Boreiko of the \"\u0413\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439\" YouTube channel,\n\nreported of a burned construction foam outside his apartment door in Almaty, as well as two cars belonging to him and videographer Roman Yegorov being burned down on 20 February.[261][262] The incident led to a swift response by the Almaty Department of Internal Affairs by launching investigation in which the unnamed suspect behind the arson was subsequently arrested.[263][264] Daniar Moldabekov, a Kazakh journalist and author of the \"5 ?\u0430?\u0442\u0430\u0440\" (\"5 January\") Telegram channel, revealed on 22 February that a man with a medical mask was shot in the entrance of his Almaty residence.[265] Gulnoza Said, coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, urged the Kazakh government to ensure that the journalists' safety and for the criminals to be held accountable.[266]\nThe increasing threats on journalists essentially prompted for President Tokayev to intervene by instructing law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigation of criminal acts towards journalists, in which Aqorda press secretary Ruslan Jeldibai accused the criminal instigators of damaging \"public security and the reputation of the state\".[267][268][269][270][271] By 21 February 2023, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that 18 people had been arrested in relation to the attacks on journalists.[272][273][274][275] Though, Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Marat Qojaev assessed that it was it was \"too early to say that the attacks were carried out on the orders of someone.\"[276] On 28 February, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and \u016bQK announced the arrest of a suspect identified as \"O. Tokarev\", allegedly responsible for organised attacks against journalists and independent media, revealing that Tokarev was a foreign citizen and a skilled hacker, and he was accompanied by four other foreign nationals named \"K. Litvinov,\" \"S. Shapovalov,\" \"B. Demchenko,\" and \"Y. Malyshok.\"[277][278] In an official report from 2 March 2023, it stated that Tokarev had pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Kazakh authorities in the criminal probe.[279][280]", "On 24 February 2023, Arman ?oraev, an independent candidate for M?jilis in the Electoral district No. 2 (Astana), sparked a scandal on social media by publishing a Facebook photo of members from the People's Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) and writing \"Do not vote for these traitors\" underneath the caption, to which the post was criticised for its divisive language and perceived discreditation on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General's Office against ?oraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology.[281][282] ?oraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.[283]\nOn 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against ?oraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party, which if proven in court, would lead for ?oraev having his M?jilis candidacy be deregistered from the election.[284] The hearings initially set to be held from 6 March, were postponed that same day for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up.[285][286] On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found ?oraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by the court would come into force until election day on 19 March, which nevertheless allowed for ?oraev to remain as a candidate in the race and insisting as the incident being a provocation by the Kazakh government to delegitimise his candidacy.[287]", "Proposals to the Article 272 of the Criminal Code [ edit ]\nThe Senate of Kazakhstan approved a draft law \"On introduction of amendments and additions to some legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the prevention of human rights in the field of criminal proceedings, execution, as well as other cruel, inhuman or defamatory acts of torture\".[288] The law proposes stricter penalties under Article 272 of the Criminal Code for individuals who call for the incitement of mass riots by increasing the maximum prison sentence from 3 to 5 years and from 3 to 7 years on social media, as well as increasing the maximum sentence for hooliganism committed as part of a criminal group from 5 to 7 years in prison without parole.[289][290] The vote took place during a plenary session ahead of the election on 9 March 2023, with Interior Minister Marat Ahmetjanov expressing support for the legislation.[291][292][293][294] The bill was subsequently signed into law by President Tokayev on 17 March.[295]\nElectoral fraud allegations [ edit ]\nConcerns about electoral fraud arose ahead of the election, after photos circulating on social media from several polling stations in Shymkent had allegedly shown the existence of voting results protocols completed with numbers indicating the votes cast for each candidate shortly before polls were opened to the public.[296] ?mir ?ynybekuly, an independent candidate running in Shymkent II, called on the Prosecutor General's Office to intervene and urged President Tokayev to temporarily suspend the powers of the Shymkent City Akimat.[297] In response, the Shymkent Territorial Election Commission chairman Qaiybek Qunanbaev dismissed the claims of prepared voting protocol results as being \"fake stuffing and provocation\", insisting that election protocols are filled after voting takes place and noted the absence of a seal in the alleged precinct result tallies.[298]\nAfter polls opened on election day, independent monitoring NGO Erkindik Qanaty claimed election violations, which included restrictions on observer movements, limited visibility of the voter registration process, bans on photo and video recording, campaign activities by the precinct election commission chairman, and failure to provide an observer's chair which served as a violation of instructions for equipping the polling station.[299] Voting irregularities emerged across Kazakhstan, with numerous videos captured by independent observers showing instances of ballot box stuffing and carousel voting taking place in polling stations.[300][301] Others at several polling sites witnessed surveillance cameras being covered with tape.[302] Azamat Sar?azin, head of the Public Interest Protection Service of the Prosecutor General's Office, reported that 18 members of the election commission were fined and suspended due to election violations involving in issuing voting ballots to people for relatives.[303][304] CEC chairman Nurlan ?bdirov, acknowledging the possible vote tampering, requested the Prosecutor General's Office for \"an inspection and legal assessment\" of widespread irregularities.[305][306] The Prosecutor General's Office in the aftermath of the vote, registered a total of 40 violations during election day, upon which included election campaigning after its prohibition period.[307]"]}

Collared Urns, usually associated with cremation remains, are found in barrows at Trannak, Bears Down, Gaverigan, Davidstow (dated c. 2500\u20131900 BCE, based on charcoal beneath the urn, probably giving an incorrect early date), Colliford (1720\u20131960 BCE), and the entrance grave at Tregiffian (c."}, {"feature_type": "text", "feature_score": 0.848472044950762, "feature_rank": 7, "text_score": 0.8484719269100462, "feature": "Environment and ecology.
