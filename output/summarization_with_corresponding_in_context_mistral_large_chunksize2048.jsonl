He also designed the interior, incorporating traditional Andaluc\u00edan features and ceramic tiles for decoration and explanatory texts. In Pedraza, he restored the Casa de la Inquisici\u00f3n, turning it into a hoster\u00eda with a rustic style, but the plan to expand it with neighboring buildings didn't materialize. The Pedraza Hoster\u00eda operated until 1992. At Alca\u00f1iz, Picardo converted the Palacio de los Comendadores into a Parador with 12 guest rooms, preserving the medieval design on the ground floor and making the upper floors more palatial. He also designed the interior decoration, incorporating the emblem of the Order of Calatrava. In 1975, he designed a new two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998. In C\u00e1ceres, Picardo worked on the Palacio del Comendador de Alc\u00faescar, converting part of it into a Hoster\u00eda, which was built in a jumble of old buildings, mostly stables and coach houses, and featured a sgraffito image above the main doorway.", "text": "There were further small secondary patios. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andaluc\u00edan architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and J\u00e1en, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects. He also used his typical ceramic tiles throughout the building, both for decoration and for explanatory texts.Picardo planned 18 guest rooms, but initially only 9 were built, some in the building facing the plaza, and the rest fronting the cliff-edge view. The latter benefitted from the same design of open wooden galleries Picardo had utilised at Ja\u00e9n. The Parador opened to guests on 7 November 1966.Picardo returned to Arcos in 1974 to complete his original plan, building another floor on the part of the building overlooking the cliff, using the same design features, and increased the number of guest rooms to 18. The extension entered service in 1979. Hoster\u00eda de Pedraza: Hoster\u00eda Pintor Zuloaga. In 1965 Picardo was commissioned by Paradores to restore and rehabilitate the old Casa de la Inquisici\u00f3n (House of the Inquisition) in the small, historic village of Pedraza, 37 kilometres northeast of Segovia in  Castilla y Le\u00f3n. It was to be a hoster\u00eda - only a restaurant and a bar - without guest rooms.The three-storey property was mostly in ruins when Picardo surveyed it and was consequently not protected by conservation laws. He was therefore free to carry out his renovation as he saw fit, building on the medieval and rural ambience of the village. On the exterior he rearranged and improved the windows, preserved the surviving coat of arms above the front door, and at the rear added what was becoming his signature open wooden gallery on the top floor. Inside, Picardo followed the rustic style of the region's inns, building a spacious lounge behind the entrance hall, with a large and low fireplace, and on the upper floors the bar and the 90-seat dining-room opening onto the balcony-gallery.Once again, Picardo designed his own furniture and other fittings, the lighting and decoration, following the local style.. The hoster\u00eda - named \"Pintor Zuloaga\" - opened to the public on 14 December 1967.At the same time Picardo raised the idea of expanding the property by purchasing neighbouring buildings. He had been concerned that the Hoster\u00eda had restricted views, and felt that an extension could be designed with extensive views of the Sierra de Guadarrama to the south. His plans offered the prospect of 16 guest rooms and in November 1969 the proposal to convert the Hoster\u00eda into a Parador was made public. However, difficulties in purchasing the neighbouring property made the project impossible.The Pedraza Hoster\u00eda continued in operation until 15 December 1992 when economic pressures on the Parador chain caused its closure. Parador de Alca\u00f1iz: La Concordia. In 1966 Picardo began the conversion into a Parador of the Palacio de los Comendadores at Alca\u00f1iz in the province of Teruel in Aragon. The palace - the fa\u00e7ade of which was remodelled in late-Renaissance style in 1728 - stood as the most prominent additional part of the Castillo de los Calatravos (Castle of the Calatravos), a monastery-fortress built in 1179. The oldest parts of the structure, a keep, a church and a cloister, date to the 12th and 13th centuries.The section of the property set aside for Picardo's conversion was the immense south wing, which was flanked by two towers and divided into three floors, the ground floor built of ashlar and the upper two floors of brick. There were balconies on the first floor, and on the uppermost floor a characteristic Aragonese long gallery had been developed, created by a succession of semi-circular arches. The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms. His plan for the public areas included the conversion of two large and long ground floor interiors, with pointed barrel-vaulted ceilings, on each side of the building's entrance. To the left of the entry, in the original guardhouse, he placed the reception area and to the right, where the old stables were situated, he placed the bar and cafeter\u00eda, adding one single window to each space to allow in some daylight. In these rooms Picardo left the exposed masonry of the walls and ceilings. The main dining room, which he placed on the first floor, connected by the main staircase from the ground floor, was based on the great hall of a palace. In it he featured a large fireplace and chimney at one end, and used a multitude of large timber beams to shape a coffered ceiling, with decorative plasterwork strung below.. The twelve guest rooms were arranged on the second floor, but the windows being high in the walls, Picardo arranged for a raised area in front of each window so that guests could see out of the windows with greater ease. The public corridors followed the design pioneered by Picardo at Ja\u00e9n of imitation stone groin vaults at regular intervals.In planning the interior decoration Picardo determined that the ground floor would be medieval in design in keeping with the original military use of the palace, and the upper floors would be more palatial in decor. He designed much of the joinery, the beds, the tables, the chairs and, in particular, the light fittings, making use of the emblem of the Order of Calatrava as a decorative motif. His attention to detail even extended to the design of hinges and handles for doors, and for the heads of nails used in the door faces. He also made considerable use of his characteristic ceramic murals decorating the public parts of the building, including his history of the castle, all produced by his favoured ceramicist, Juan Manuel Arroyo, and signed by Picardo.The Parador opened for service on 18 May 1968 and was inaugurated on 6 July 1968.As early as 1972 Picardo had reported to the Ministry of Information and Tourism on the feasibility of carrying out further work to increase the number of rooms at Alca\u00f1iz. In 1975 he designed a new two-storey wing for the ruined west side of the complex which would double the number of guests rooms. His plans lay in abeyance until 1998 when the architect Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuenca G\u00f3mez resurrected Picardo's original 1975 designs. They had to be altered somewhat in the light of archeological discoveries made since 1975, but much of Picardo's ideas were incorporated in the expansion of the Parador, bringing the number of guest rooms to 38. Hoster\u00eda de C\u00e1ceres: El Comendador. In 1966 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alc\u00faescar (Commander's Palace of Alc\u00faescar), also known as the Palacio de los Marqueses de Torre Orgaz, in the historic centre of C\u00e1ceres in the province of the same name in Extremadura. Originally built as a medieval fortified residence on pre-existing Arab buildings in 1488, the palace was modified in later centuries, adding Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The Ministry proposed the conversion of one part of the palace into a Hoster\u00eda.The part of the building on which Picardo was to work was a jumble of old buildings, some attached to the main palace building and some free-standing, which had mostly formed stables and coach houses. There was also a patio-garden between these buildings and the palace and its tower.. Picardo began by demolishing most of the ramshackle service buildings, other than the square structure at Number 6 Calle Ancha which benefitted from substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. Picardo decided the lower ground floor of this building would form the bar and cafeter\u00eda, with a doorway from the street which would become the main entrance to the Hoster\u00eda. He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings. Picardo also installed a sgraffito image above the main doorway, featuring the cross of the Orden de Santiago (Order of Santiago).A new one-storey building was erected to the rear of the plot, imitating similar buildings in the city. Ashlar and solid brick formed the interior and exterior facings of the walls, and pantiles were utilised on the roofs. Picardo also excavated large areas beneath the buildings to make service areas. He designed and built a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden."}]}, "correct": false}

The Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura recognized his contributions with the publication of \"Dibujos de Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo\" in 1960.", "text": "Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castell\u00f3n. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing \u2014 in particular his mastery of perspective \u2014 drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine F\u00edgaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Bolet\u00edn de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing \"increasing sophistication\" and being of \"complexity and extraordinary quality\". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of \u201cthe most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andaluc\u00eda for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career. Its influence, particularly in his work on Paradores, can be clearly seen.. During the 1950s Picardo pursued his personal architectural ambitions, entering competitions and publishing plans and drawings of uncommissioned buildings. In 1951 in  company with his fellow architect Carlos de Miguel he designed a centre for the Cofrad\u00eda de Pescadores (Fishermen's Brotherhood) of Altea in the province of Alicante which attracted much attention but remained unbuilt.Picardo, working alone, designed a small hotel which could be built on the Costa del Sol in Andaluc\u00eda. He described it as \"un modesto parador (a modest inn), resolved in a simple and attractive way\".In competition, Picardo entered plans and drawings of a preliminary draft for the Delegaci\u00f3n de Hacienda de Gerona (Treasury Delegation in Gerona) but came second behind the Spanish architect Carlos Sobrini who had been a year behind Picardo at college. He also came second in a similar competition a year later with a design for the Delegaci\u00f3n de Hacienda en Las Palmas (Treasury Delegation in Las Palmas), once again losing to Carlos Sobrini.In 1958 Picardo co-designed with his brother Carlos Picardo a six-storey edificio de viviendas (apartment building) near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas, designed for middle-class families.In the early 1960s Picardo built some houses in the vernacular and historical Andaluc\u00edan style on the Costa del Sol and in Jerez and, in contrast, a number of modernist apartment blocks for the construction company Urbis in Madrid. He also moved on to a series of building commissions for the Spanish Ministerio de Informaci\u00f3n y Turismo (Ministry of Information and Tourism) which laid the foundation for his notable work in the 1960s and 1970s on a large number of the state-owned luxury hotel network Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a.. Even early in his architectural career, Picardo was viewed as a supreme draughtsman, producing quick sketches, perspectives, views, details and innumerable plans of his projects in which his skills can be easily identified. Artist. As well as his work on modern buildings and on preservation and restoration projects through the 1950s, Picardo continued to receive commissions for decorative mural paintings, where he \"demonstrated his mastery in the use of colour and techniques such as watercolour and oil\". His works were seen in locations such as the new Hotel de Los Cisnes in Jerez, while in Madrid he embellished the Bar Jerez, the Hotel Plaza, the Residencia de Ingenieros del Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n (Engineers' residence of the National Institute of Colonization), the Exposici\u00f3n de Regiones Devastadas (Exposition of Devastated Regions), the Instituto de \u00d3ptica \"Daza de Vald\u00e9s\" (Institute of Optics), the sales area of the Garaje Villamagna (Villamagna Garage) and in 1953 he completed extensive paintings at the Restaurante Commodore in Madrid where amongst other images he produced two large curved panoramic views, one of Madrid and one of C\u00e1diz. Picardo was regarded as an \"outstanding\" muralist.At the same time his drawings of buildings and architectural details were published as illustrations in a best-selling textbook on monumental and historic Spanish architecture, Arquitectura Popular Espa\u00f1ola, by the restoration and conservation architect Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s. Picardo travelled around Spain with him, making a multitude of detailed drawings of vernacular architectural elements for Balb\u00e1s' books.. Picardo's published architectural drawings were highly regarded. They were described as \"magnificent\" by the leading Spanish restoration architect Luis Men\u00e9ndez-Pidal y \u00c1lvarez.In 1959 Picardo was given an unusual commission: to design a pack of baraja de naipes (playing cards) for exclusive use as advertising material by the Spanish fashion brand Loewe. With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces' types. It is dated to 1960.Around 1960 Picardo was rewarded by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura (DGA) for the many illustrations he had provided for the DGA's Bolet\u00edn since he was a student with the publication of a small book, Dibujos de Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo (Drawings of Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo)."}]}, "correct": true}

He chose to build the hoster\u00eda on the site of the old barracks and stables, rather than in the castle itself, due to his desire to preserve the original walls and battlements. The building was designed in a simple style, with large windows to enjoy the views, and was constructed using modern materials hidden by traditional ones to give the appearance of age. The first phase of the building, completed in 1965, included 7 double guest rooms, a cafeter\u00eda, a bar, a reception area, a lounge, a restaurant, and service areas. Picardo added service rooms and 12 more guest rooms in 1969, and a further extension with 24 guest rooms in 1973, bringing the total to 43. The building was elevated to the title of Parador when the extension was completed in 1978.

He used hand-painted written ceramic tiles to decorate and 'sign' the building, and to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.", "text": "He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. He featured hand-painted written ceramic tiles, produced by Juan Manuel Arroyo, to decorate and 'sign' the building, to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.In an article about the Ja\u00e9n Parador for an architectural magazine in 1967, Picardo rhapsodised about the mood and aura he had created for the building: \"Exterior, un conjunto de masas elementales rectangulares./Interior, techos con artesas, b\u00f3vedas y arcos, madera, barro y piedra. .../Ay del romancero!\" (Outside, a gathering of rectangular blocks./Inside, artesonado ceilings, vaults and arches, wood, clay and stone. .../Oh, the romance!)In the same article Picardo credited his \"maestros\" (masters): \"Torres-Balb\u00e1s, Moya, Sota y Luis Santamaria. Ninguno de ells la ha vista. Qu\u00e9 dir\u00e1n?\" (None of them has seen it. What will they say?). At Jaen, and at Guadalupe, finished at much the same time, Picardo established a style of architecture and interior design which found favour with his clients and their guests and which he was to pursue in most of his further work for Paradores, refining it where required and elsewhere repeating it faithfully. Parador de Arcos de la Frontera: Casa del Corregidor. The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera in the province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda is located in the centre of the old town, at the top of the cliffs that overhang the Rio Guadalete. Picardo first visited the triangular site in February 1964. He decided immediately that the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings facing the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and the castle should be preserved, while the rest of the site \u2014 the old municipal slaughterhouse and other public utility premises and houses \u2014 should be demolished, though seven 2.35 metre columns from a patio within one of the buildings should be preserved to be used in the new building.In the twelve months from February 1964 all the demolition work was carried out. Picardo started work in October that year. He encountered a problem with a 15 centimetres wide crack across the top of the cliff which had been caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  He surmounted it by constructing a patio rather than building on the fractured zone next to the cliff edge. This single deck was built as an independent structure separated from the main building, so that any future movement of the terrain would not effect the Parador itself.. Picardo's design of the Parador was a copy of a typical Andaluc\u00edan residence with an entrance hallway leading to a typical patio, open to the sky, with terracing supported by the seven reused columns (though one further column had to be made to copy the others so as to achieve the same number of columns on all four sides). There were further small secondary patios. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andaluc\u00edan architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and J\u00e1en, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects. He also used his typical ceramic tiles throughout the building, both for decoration and for explanatory texts.Picardo planned 18 guest rooms, but initially only 9 were built, some in the building facing the plaza, and the rest fronting the cliff-edge view. The latter benefitted from the same design of open wooden galleries Picardo had utilised at Ja\u00e9n.

He chose to build the hoster\u00eda on the site of the old barracks and stables, rather than in the castle itself, due to his desire to preserve the original walls and battlements. The building was designed in a simple style, with large windows to enjoy the views, and was constructed using modern materials hidden by traditional ones to give the appearance of age. The first phase of the building, completed in 1965, included 7 double guest rooms, a cafeter\u00eda, a bar, a reception area, a lounge, a restaurant, and service areas. Picardo added service rooms and 12 more guest rooms in 1969, and a further extension with 24 guest rooms in 1973, bringing the total to 43. The building was elevated to the title of Parador when the extension was completed in 1978. Picardo also designed the interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns, and coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. He used hand-painted written ceramic tiles to decorate and 'sign' the building, and to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.", "text": "He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. He featured hand-painted written ceramic tiles, produced by Juan Manuel Arroyo, to decorate and 'sign' the building, to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.In an article about the Ja\u00e9n Parador for an architectural magazine in 1967, Picardo rhapsodised about the mood and aura he had created for the building: \"Exterior, un conjunto de masas elementales rectangulares./Interior, techos con artesas, b\u00f3vedas y arcos, madera, barro y piedra. .../Ay del romancero!\" (Outside, a gathering of rectangular blocks./Inside, artesonado ceilings, vaults and arches, wood, clay and stone. .../Oh, the romance!)In the same article Picardo credited his \"maestros\" (masters): \"Torres-Balb\u00e1s, Moya, Sota y Luis Santamaria. Ninguno de ells la ha vista. Qu\u00e9 dir\u00e1n?\" (None of them has seen it. What will they say?). At Jaen, and at Guadalupe, finished at much the same time, Picardo established a style of architecture and interior design which found favour with his clients and their guests and which he was to pursue in most of his further work for Paradores, refining it where required and elsewhere repeating it faithfully. Parador de Arcos de la Frontera: Casa del Corregidor. The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera in the province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda is located in the centre of the old town, at the top of the cliffs that overhang the Rio Guadalete. Picardo first visited the triangular site in February 1964. He decided immediately that the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings facing the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and the castle should be preserved, while the rest of the site \u2014 the old municipal slaughterhouse and other public utility premises and houses \u2014 should be demolished, though seven 2.35 metre columns from a patio within one of the buildings should be preserved to be used in the new building.In the twelve months from February 1964 all the demolition work was carried out. Picardo started work in October that year. He encountered a problem with a 15 centimetres wide crack across the top of the cliff which had been caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  He surmounted it by constructing a patio rather than building on the fractured zone next to the cliff edge. This single deck was built as an independent structure separated from the main building, so that any future movement of the terrain would not effect the Parador itself.. Picardo's design of the Parador was a copy of a typical Andaluc\u00edan residence with an entrance hallway leading to a typical patio, open to the sky, with terracing supported by the seven reused columns (though one further column had to be made to copy the others so as to achieve the same number of columns on all four sides). There were further small secondary patios. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andaluc\u00edan architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and J\u00e1en, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects. He also used his typical ceramic tiles throughout the building, both for decoration and for explanatory texts.Picardo planned 18 guest rooms, but initially only 9 were built, some in the building facing the plaza, and the rest fronting the cliff-edge view. The latter benefitted from the same design of open wooden galleries Picardo had utilised at Ja\u00e9n. The Parador opened to guests on 7 November 1966.Picardo returned to Arcos in 1974 to complete his original plan, building another floor on the part of the building overlooking the cliff, using the same design features, and increased the number of guest rooms to 18.

The Pedraza Hoster\u00eda operated until 1992. At Alca\u00f1iz, Picardo converted the Palacio de los Comendadores into a Parador with 12 guest rooms, preserving the medieval design on the ground floor and making the upper floors more palatial. He also designed the interior decoration, incorporating the emblem of the Order of Calatrava. In 1975, he designed a new two-story wing to double the number of guest rooms, which was completed in 1998.

In 1965 Picardo was commissioned by Paradores to restore and rehabilitate the old Casa de la Inquisici\u00f3n (House of the Inquisition) in the small, historic village of Pedraza, 37 kilometres northeast of Segovia in  Castilla y Le\u00f3n. It was to be a hoster\u00eda - only a restaurant and a bar - without guest rooms.The three-storey property was mostly in ruins when Picardo surveyed it and was consequently not protected by conservation laws. He was therefore free to carry out his renovation as he saw fit, building on the medieval and rural ambience of the village. On the exterior he rearranged and improved the windows, preserved the surviving coat of arms above the front door, and at the rear added what was becoming his signature open wooden gallery on the top floor. Inside, Picardo followed the rustic style of the region's inns, building a spacious lounge behind the entrance hall, with a large and low fireplace, and on the upper floors the bar and the 90-seat dining-room opening onto the balcony-gallery.Once again, Picardo designed his own furniture and other fittings, the lighting and decoration, following the local style.. The hoster\u00eda - named \"Pintor Zuloaga\" - opened to the public on 14 December 1967.At the same time Picardo raised the idea of expanding the property by purchasing neighbouring buildings. He had been concerned that the Hoster\u00eda had restricted views, and felt that an extension could be designed with extensive views of the Sierra de Guadarrama to the south. His plans offered the prospect of 16 guest rooms and in November 1969 the proposal to convert the Hoster\u00eda into a Parador was made public. However, difficulties in purchasing the neighbouring property made the project impossible.The Pedraza Hoster\u00eda continued in operation until 15 December 1992 when economic pressures on the Parador chain caused its closure. Parador de Alca\u00f1iz: La Concordia. In 1966 Picardo began the conversion into a Parador of the Palacio de los Comendadores at Alca\u00f1iz in the province of Teruel in Aragon. The palace - the fa\u00e7ade of which was remodelled in late-Renaissance style in 1728 - stood as the most prominent additional part of the Castillo de los Calatravos (Castle of the Calatravos), a monastery-fortress built in 1179. The oldest parts of the structure, a keep, a church and a cloister, date to the 12th and 13th centuries.The section of the property set aside for Picardo's conversion was the immense south wing, which was flanked by two towers and divided into three floors, the ground floor built of ashlar and the upper two floors of brick. There were balconies on the first floor, and on the uppermost floor a characteristic Aragonese long gallery had been developed, created by a succession of semi-circular arches. The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms. His plan for the public areas included the conversion of two large and long ground floor interiors, with pointed barrel-vaulted ceilings, on each side of the building's entrance. To the left of the entry, in the original guardhouse, he placed the reception area and to the right, where the old stables were situated, he placed the bar and cafeter\u00eda, adding one single window to each space to allow in some daylight. In these rooms Picardo left the exposed masonry of the walls and ceilings. The main dining room, which he placed on the first floor, connected by the main staircase from the ground floor, was based on the great hall of a palace. In it he featured a large fireplace and chimney at one end, and used a multitude of large timber beams to shape a coffered ceiling, with decorative plasterwork strung below.. The twelve guest rooms were arranged on the second floor, but the windows being high in the walls, Picardo arranged for a raised area in front of each window so that guests could see out of the windows with greater ease. The public corridors followed the design pioneered by Picardo at Ja\u00e9n of imitation stone groin vaults at regular intervals.In planning the interior decoration Picardo determined that the ground floor would be medieval in design in keeping with the original military use of the palace, and the upper floors would be more palatial in decor. He designed much of the joinery, the beds, the tables, the chairs and, in particular, the light fittings, making use of the emblem of the Order of Calatrava as a decorative motif. His attention to detail even extended to the design of hinges and handles for doors, and for the heads of nails used in the door faces. He also made considerable use of his characteristic ceramic murals decorating the public parts of the building, including his history of the castle, all produced by his favoured ceramicist, Juan Manuel Arroyo, and signed by Picardo.The Parador opened for service on 18 May 1968 and was inaugurated on 6 July 1968.As early as 1972 Picardo had reported to the Ministry of Information and Tourism on the feasibility of carrying out further work to increase the number of rooms at Alca\u00f1iz. In 1975 he designed a new two-storey wing for the ruined west side of the complex which would double the number of guests rooms. His plans lay in abeyance until 1998 when the architect Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuenca G\u00f3mez resurrected Picardo's original 1975 designs. They had to be altered somewhat in the light of archeological discoveries made since 1975, but much of Picardo's ideas were incorporated in the expansion of the Parador, bringing the number of guest rooms to 38. Hoster\u00eda de C\u00e1ceres: El Comendador. In 1966 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alc\u00faescar (Commander's Palace of Alc\u00faescar), also known as the Palacio de los Marqueses de Torre Orgaz, in the historic centre of C\u00e1ceres in the province of the same name in Extremadura. Originally built as a medieval fortified residence on pre-existing Arab buildings in 1488, the palace was modified in later centuries, adding Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The Ministry proposed the conversion of one part of the palace into a Hoster\u00eda.The part of the building on which Picardo was to work was a jumble of old buildings, some attached to the main palace building and some free-standing, which had mostly formed stables and coach houses. There was also a patio-garden between these buildings and the palace and its tower.. Picardo began by demolishing most of the ramshackle service buildings, other than the square structure at Number 6 Calle Ancha which benefitted from substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. Picardo decided the lower ground floor of this building would form the bar and cafeter\u00eda, with a doorway from the street which would become the main entrance to the Hoster\u00eda. He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings. Picardo also installed a sgraffito image above the main doorway, featuring the cross of the Orden de Santiago (Order of Santiago).A new one-storey building was erected to the rear of the plot, imitating similar buildings in the city. Ashlar and solid brick formed the interior and exterior facings of the walls, and pantiles were utilised on the roofs. Picardo also excavated large areas beneath the buildings to make service areas. He designed and built a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden."}]}, "correct": false}

He worked on the Castillo de Sig\u00fcenza, where he maintained a medieval aesthetic by minimizing exterior windows and adding many courtyard window openings. He also preserved some original features while reconstructing others in a historical style. Picardo's work aimed to create a convincing historical atmosphere for tourists, sometimes at the expense of historical accuracy. His approach has been criticized by some archaeologists and historians, who argue that his rebuilding projects were not based on thorough archaeological research and that they involved the demolition of significant parts of monumental buildings. Despite these criticisms, Picardo's work has also been praised for its artistic value and its contribution to Spain's tourism industry.", "text": "Because the ingress of light to the interior of the building had been reduced by the minimising of the size of the exterior windows that remained, daylight had to reach the interior by making many window openings in the courtyard walls.. On the north wall of the courtyard and approached from the outside by the barbican towers, Picardo installed the main reception area and rebuilt a portico area with pillars and intermediate glass. Above were bedrooms with balconied terraces erected in his signature timber style. He repeated the historical rendering of the exterior facades of the castle which had been decorated with sgraffito, and which he had removed, by replicating the decoration on the northern walls of the courtyard.In the northeast corner of the ground floor had been the bishops' throne room, and Picardo here installed the main guest lounge, a lofty room with a timber-beamed ceiling and two large fireplaces and chimneys. On the east side of the ground floor was the dining room, with the building's only large windows, which looked out onto the wooded ravine of the Arroyo Vadillo. The room used Picardo's favoured powerful stone vaulting to hide the steel supporting structure of the floor above. On the courtyard side of the dining room he placed a similarly vaulted bar and caf\u00e9. Wide wooden staircases on this eastern side led to the first and second floor bedrooms, a few of which were in the northeast tower with windows looking over the town, and some towards the south, but most looking into the courtyard with those on the upper floor benefitting from Picardo's typical  balconies. Another lounge with a wooden coffered ceiling was located on the first floor. Picardo took care to preserve one of the oldest rooms of the castle, the original chapel.. A further much smaller, three-storied pastiche monastic courtyard with semi-circular arches was built at the southern end of the castle which had sustained the most damage in the Civil War bombardment, with more guest rooms arranged around it. On the inner face of the west wall the original wine cellars, dungeons, granaries, bakeries and stables were removed and against this wall Picardo installed a 65 metres long banqueting hall with his familiar stone vaulting, and an attached bar room. Below this hall he installed large service areas.. Picardo, as  usual, provided his own interior decor, with special attention to the medieval. He designed classic Castilian-style furniture, flooring, rugs, doors, windows, light fittings, mirrors, heraldic displays, seigneurial crests, banners, explanatory mosaics and so on, everything down to the smallest detail. Picardo built 38 guest rooms and one suite on the first floor, and 42 rooms and one suite on the second floor, providing space for 162 guests. On the wall of the main entrance hall Picardo placed a mural consisting of 45 tiles making up a cartouche recounting, in his own words, the history of the Castillo de los Obispos de Sig\u00fcenza accompanied by a description of the physical work carried out in restoring the building. \"La actual construcci\u00f3n es casi toda nueva ...\" (The present building is almost all new ...) Picardo declaimed. He continued (translated into English): \"... the authentic parts being preserved, though reconstructed, the Romanesque chapel, the entrance and towers as well as the barbican, the two Renaissance doorways of the parade ground and the throne room. \u2026 The perimeter of the castle has been respected, the eastern fa\u00e7ade being completely new and the other three reconstructed and remodelled. Wide gaps have been closed and additions have been demolished, trying to restore the medieval character of the exterior.\" He goes on to say the work was completed in 1976 and that he, Don Jos\u00e9 Luis Picardo, was the architect.The Parador opened to the public on 20 July 1976 and the first stage of building work was finished in November of that year. It was inaugurated by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof\u00eda in April 1978. Sig\u00fcenza was to be Picardo's last major project for the Paradores.. Remodelling and modernisation of the Parador took place in 1990 under the direction of the architect Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuenca G\u00f3mez who scrupulously followed Picardo's style. Despite these further works, the Parador has kept its original character as established by Picardo. Most of the improvements have been only to modernise the services and facilities. Other Parador projects. In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of M\u00e9rida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monz\u00f3n, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Catalu\u00f1a and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Catalu\u00f1a.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Ant\u00f3n at A Coru\u00f1a in 1968, the Posada del Cord\u00f3n at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del De\u00e1n and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia. Also in 1971 Picardo inspected the castle at Molina de Arag\u00f3n in the province of Guadalajara, and possibly also in 1971 the Castillo de Valderrobres in Teruel in Aragon. In 1972 he surveyed the castle at Trujillo in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, the cave houses of Mes\u00f3n Gitano (now known as the yacimiento arqueol\u00f3gico Barrio Almohad\u00ed (archeological site Barrio Almohad\u00ed) and the nearby Alcazaba of Almer\u00eda, and the castle-fortress at Aracena in the Province of Huelva in Andaluc\u00eda. In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Controversial legacy of Picardo's Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo's work at Sig\u00fcenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects' objective as being escenograf\u00eda convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached \u2014 Picardo's Parador at J\u00e4en is a good example \u2014 she has described them as being \"falso hist\u00f3rico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo's defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art)."}]}, "correct": false}

This district also welcomed a large immigrant population. Thanks to the 1992 Olympic Games, it underwent a process of renovation of the entire waterfront, where the Olympic Village was located. Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla\u00e7a del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts. The most notable were those of 1837, in which the city was divided into four districts (Lonja, San Pedro, Universidad and San Pablo); and that of 1878, after the demolition of the walls, in which 10 districts were established: I-La Barceloneta, II-Borne, III-Lonja, IV-Atarazanas, V-Hospital, VI-Audiencia, VII-Instituto, VIII-Universidad, IX-Hostafranchs and X-Concepci\u00f3n.Between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several neighboring municipalities were added to the city (Sants, Les Corts, Sant Gervasi de Cassoles, Gr\u00e0cia, Sant Andreu de Palomar, Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, Sant Joan d'Horta, Sarri\u00e0); a new administrative reorganization was then carried out, again with 10 districts: I-Barceloneta and Pueblo Nuevo, II-San Pedro, III-Lonja and Audiencia, IV-Concepci\u00f3n, V-Atarazanas and Hospital, VI-Universidad, VII-Sans, Las Corts and Hostafranchs, VIII-Gracia and San Gervasio, IX-Horta and Sant Andreu de Palomar, X-Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als.In 1933 a new reformulation was made, also with ten districts: I-Barceloneta, II-Poble Sec and Montju\u00efc, III-Sarri\u00e0, Vallvidrera and Sant Gervasi, IV- Sant Pere and Dreta de l'Eixample, V-Raval, VI-Esquerra de l'Eixample, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gr\u00e0cia, IX-Horta, Sant Andreu del Palomar, Sagrera and Camp de l'Arpa, X-Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, Clot and Poblenou.

The new districts were established with maximum respect for their historical and morphological identity, but also seeking a practical and functional delimitation that would guarantee the residents a wide range of services. In general, an attempt was made to respect the old demarcations coming from the old city, its expansion and the aggregated municipalities, although some areas varied with respect to their historical belonging: Pedralbes, previously belonging to Sarri\u00e0, passed to Les Corts; Vallcarca, before Horta, was incorporated to Gr\u00e0cia; El Guinard\u00f3, originally from Sant Mart\u00ed, was added to Horta; and the new district of Nou Barris was segregated from Sant Andreu.The last reform was carried out in 2006, this time aimed at establishing the neighborhoods that make up each district, with the objective of improving the distribution of facilities and proximity services. Seventy-three neighborhoods were established, stipulated according to historical, cultural and social criteria, although the decision was not without controversy, mainly due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods defended as units by the neighborhood associations: thus, for example, from the neighborhood of El Clot was segregated El Camp de l'Arpa; from Sants was segregated the neighborhood of Badal; Esquerra de l'Eixample was divided between La Nova and L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample; and Poblenou was fragmented into five neighborhoods. Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city.

In 1260, a new wall was built to encompass these new neighborhoods, which had eighty towers and eight gates. The urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, including aristocracy, institutional power, bishopric, religious orders, guilds, and trade associations. Houses were typically \"artisan type,\" while larger buildings included churches, palaces, institutional buildings, hospitals, and markets. The first private urban planning operation took place in 1209 with the opening of Montcada street. In the late 14th century, the Raval wall was constructed, leading to the creation of La Rambla and its urbanization in 1444. During the Early Modern Age, an extensive network of roads emerged, connecting the city to various suburbs and points of interest. The period was marked by alternating prosperity and economic crisis, with the city confined within its walls. The main urban reforms included the construction of the port in 1438, the sea wall in the first half of the 16th century, and the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu in front of the cathedral. The 17th century saw the extension of the city wall with five new gates, paved streets, sewers, drinking water fountains, and improvement works in the port. The arrival of the Bourbons in the 18th century led to the truncation of Catalonia's autonomy and the demolition of 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood for the construction of the Citadel.", "text": "Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea. The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km\u00b2. The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montju\u00efc; those of Martorell and Castellv\u00ed de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Erampruny\u00e0 (Gav\u00e0) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Bes\u00f2s river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10\u201312 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent \u2014later City Hall\u2014 or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital \u2014such as the Santa Creu\u2014 or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the B\u00f2ria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Pla\u00e7a Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara \u2014in the current Citadel Park\u2014, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marqu\u00e8s del l'Argentera. Currently only the Portal de Santa Madrona, in the Drassanes, is still preserved.With the extension of the wall, a long avenue known as La Rambla, occupied mainly by religious institutions, was left within the city walls. It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc. Early Modern Age. In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry. The city was still confined within its walls \u2014the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta\u2014 despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona's capital status meant that large-scale projects were not carried out. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Pla\u00e7a de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montju\u00efc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area. In this period there was a notable demographic increase, and the economy was progressively industrialized, until it led to the so-called Industrial Revolution.. The arrival of the Bourbons generated a series of military engineering works, such as the castle of Montju\u00efc and the fortress of the Citadel. For the construction of the Citadel (1715-1751), 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood were demolished, leaving 4500 people homeless and without compensation, and the Rec Comtal was diverted."}]}, "correct": false}

The first division in 1389 established four quarters, reflecting social differences between aristocratic, residential, industrial, and popular areas. In the 18th century, the city was divided into five quarters, and numerous divisions followed in the 19th century for political reasons. After adding neighboring municipalities between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city was reorganized into 10 districts.

The text highlights that these districts have distinct populations, with varying age distributions, socio-economic backgrounds, and educational levels.", "text": "It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinard\u00f3 (11.96 km\u00b2, 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinard\u00f3 district, formerly belonging to Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. During the years of massive immigration, it was an area of strong real estate speculation.. Nou Barris (8.04 km\u00b2, 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar. It is a peripheral area with a majority immigrant population, which also suffered from strong real estate speculation and even suffered from shantyism and self-construction, and which for a long time has suffered from a significant lack of assistance, infrastructure and basic services, which have been mitigated in recent times. The majority of the population is working class and has low purchasing power.. Sant Andreu (6.56 km\u00b2, 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of Sant Andreu de Palomar, annexed in 1897. It was an agricultural and milling area until the mid-nineteenth century, when numerous industries began to settle. On the other hand, in the mid-twentieth century it received a strong wave of immigration, which was received in neighborhoods of cheap houses and residential estates, such as the Bon Pastor and Bar\u00f3 de Viver. In recent times it has experienced a certain revitalization thanks to commercial activities such as the location of the La Maquinista center or the urbanization of the surroundings of La Sagrera Station to accommodate the arrival of the AVE high-speed train.. Sant Mart\u00ed (10.80 km\u00b2, 232,629 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, added in 1897. Like the previous one, it was an agricultural and milling area, until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution when numerous factories were installed in the area; however, in recent decades it has suffered a process of deindustrialization, replaced by economic activities more based on new technologies, especially after the location of the so-called 22@ district. This district also welcomed a large immigrant population. Thanks to the 1992 Olympic Games, it underwent a process of renovation of the entire waterfront, where the Olympic Village was located. Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla\u00e7a del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts. The most notable were those of 1837, in which the city was divided into four districts (Lonja, San Pedro, Universidad and San Pablo); and that of 1878, after the demolition of the walls, in which 10 districts were established: I-La Barceloneta, II-Borne, III-Lonja, IV-Atarazanas, V-Hospital, VI-Audiencia, VII-Instituto, VIII-Universidad, IX-Hostafranchs and X-Concepci\u00f3n.Between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several neighboring municipalities were added to the city (Sants, Les Corts, Sant Gervasi de Cassoles, Gr\u00e0cia, Sant Andreu de Palomar, Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, Sant Joan d'Horta, Sarri\u00e0); a new administrative reorganization was then carried out, again with 10 districts: I-Barceloneta and Pueblo Nuevo, II-San Pedro, III-Lonja and Audiencia, IV-Concepci\u00f3n, V-Atarazanas and Hospital, VI-Universidad, VII-Sans, Las Corts and Hostafranchs, VIII-Gracia and San Gervasio, IX-Horta and Sant Andreu de Palomar, X-Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als.In 1933 a new reformulation was made, also with ten districts: I-Barceloneta, II-Poble Sec and Montju\u00efc, III-Sarri\u00e0, Vallvidrera and Sant Gervasi, IV- Sant Pere and Dreta de l'Eixample, V-Raval, VI-Esquerra de l'Eixample, VII-Sants, Les Corts and Hostafrancs, VIII-Gr\u00e0cia, IX-Horta, Sant Andreu del Palomar, Sagrera and Camp de l'Arpa, X-Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, Clot and Poblenou. These districts were expanded in 1949 with two more: XI-Les Corts and XII-Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.In 1984 the current division into ten districts was approved, established with the aim of decentralizing the City Council, transferring competencies to the new consistories. The new districts were established with maximum respect for their historical and morphological identity, but also seeking a practical and functional delimitation that would guarantee the residents a wide range of services. In general, an attempt was made to respect the old demarcations coming from the old city, its expansion and the aggregated municipalities, although some areas varied with respect to their historical belonging: Pedralbes, previously belonging to Sarri\u00e0, passed to Les Corts; Vallcarca, before Horta, was incorporated to Gr\u00e0cia; El Guinard\u00f3, originally from Sant Mart\u00ed, was added to Horta; and the new district of Nou Barris was segregated from Sant Andreu.The last reform was carried out in 2006, this time aimed at establishing the neighborhoods that make up each district, with the objective of improving the distribution of facilities and proximity services. Seventy-three neighborhoods were established, stipulated according to historical, cultural and social criteria, although the decision was not without controversy, mainly due to the fragmentation of some historical neighborhoods defended as units by the neighborhood associations: thus, for example, from the neighborhood of El Clot was segregated El Camp de l'Arpa; from Sants was segregated the neighborhood of Badal; Esquerra de l'Eixample was divided between La Nova and L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample; and Poblenou was fragmented into five neighborhoods.

The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire. This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea. The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km\u00b2. The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria."}]}, "correct": false}

These gardens disappeared a few years later with the urbanization of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. Expansion of Barcelona (Eixample). In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir \u00a1Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerd\u00e0 Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliaci\u00f3n, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Bes\u00f2s, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Cerd\u00e0 had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral\u00b7lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Gl\u00f2ries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat. It also foresaw the opening of three large avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular one that would connect the Citadel with Montjuic (avenida de la Catedral). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would circumvent the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universitat and Sant Pere.. Cerd\u00e1's project was quite innovative for the time, especially with regard to the delimitation of green spaces and service areas, taking into account both functional, recreational and welfare aspects. The buildings were to have a height of 16 meters (first floor and four floors), and a depth of 10 to 20 meters. The distribution of the Eixample was to be in sectors of 20 x 20 blocks, divided into districts of 10 x 10 and neighborhoods of 5 x 5. Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park. It also had industrial and administrative facilities, and in the suburbs there was a slaughterhouse, a cemetery and three hospitals. However, most of these provisions did not come to fruition, due to the opposition of the City Council, annoyed by the imposition of Cerd\u00e0's plan as opposed to Rovira's, which had been approved in the competition, and also due to real estate speculation, which led to building the blocks on all sides and not only on the two sides planned by Cerd\u00e1.Cerd\u00e1 accompanied his project with several memoirs and statistical studies in which he showed his urbanistic theory, developed in three main points: hygienism, based on his Monograf\u00eda estad\u00edstica de la clase obrera (Statistical monograph of the working class), where he criticizes the living conditions within the walled city in force until then \u2014life expectancy was 38.3 years for the rich and 19.7 for the poor\u2014, against which he proposes improvements in urban orientation according to factors such as climatology, as well as in the constructive elements; circulation, with a view to making public roads compatible between pedestrians and vehicular traffic, which led him to regulate the distribution of streets and to establish chamfers on all sides of the blocks to facilitate crossings; and the multipurpose design, with an urban layout that would be extrapolated both to spaces to be built and to those already existing, integrating the notions of \"widening\" and \"reform\", and that would give a hygienic and functional city, although this part of his project would not be carried out.It must be taken into account that in many cases the Cerd\u00e0 plot was superimposed on suburban layouts already existing or under development, in addition to the fact that the towns bordering the city of Barcelona, which would be added in successive phases at the turn of the nineteenth century, had their own urban development projects. Among these layouts we must take into account the highways and rural roads, or the easements imposed by railroads, canals, irrigation ditches, torrents and other land features.. A tangential aspect of the new layout was the question of toponymy, since the new urban grid designed by Cerd\u00e1 included a series of new streets for which there was no tradition when it came to naming them. The naming of the new streets was entrusted to the writer V\u00edctor Balaguer, who was inspired by the history of Catalonia: Thus, many streets are named after territories linked to the Crown of Aragon, such as Valencia, Mallorca, Aragon, Provence, Roussillon, Naples, Corsica, Sicily or Sardinia; with institutions such as the Catalan Courts, the Generalitat or the Consell de Cent; with characters such as Jaime Balmes, Enrique Granados, Buenaventura Carlos Aribau, Ram\u00f3n Muntaner, Rafael Casanova, Pau Claris, Roger de Flor, Antoni de Villarroel, Roger de Lauria, Ausi\u00e0s March or the Count of Urgel; or battles and historical events such as Bail\u00e9n, Lepanto, El Bruch or Caspe.Projects of Expansion (Eixample) Interior renovations. The Cerd\u00e0 Plan was developed mainly outside the city walls, due to real estate speculation, leaving aside the necessary improvements for the development of the old part of Barcelona. The need for a project of \"interior renovations\" was then raised, with the aim of modernizing the old core of the expanding city. One of the first was that of Miquel Garriga i Roca, author of a joint plan of alignments (1862), the first exhaustive plan of the city, at 1/250 scale. Garriga's project foresaw the realignment of streets as the basic method of a broad renovation of the city's interior, but the difficulty of its execution and the absence of expropriation mechanisms paralyzed this first project.. A more elaborate project was carried out by \u00c0ngel Baixeras in 1878, who presented an expropriation bill to the Senate, which was approved in 1879. Baixeras' project envisaged a thorough remodeling of the old city, and its most outstanding aspect was the opening of three major thoroughfares \u2014initially called A, B and C\u2014 to make the old city center more walkable, following Cerd\u00e0's old project. However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed V\u00eda Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport. In 1860 an omnibus line had been opened along La Rambla, but the slowness of the carriages made this means of transport not very viable. In 1872, rails were laid for its traction, which lightened the transport, with imperial model cars \u2014of English origin\u2014, pulled by two or four horses. The line was extended from the port (Drassanes) to the village of Gracia, and later from the Drassanes to La Barceloneta. One of the first lines to operate was the English Barcelona Tramways Company Limited. In 1899 the streetcars were electrified.. During these years, street furniture also grew, especially since the appointment in 1871 of Antoni Rovira i Trias as head of Buildings and Ornamentation of the City Council, as well as his successor, Pere Falqu\u00e9s, who made a special effort to combine aesthetics and functionality for this type of urban adornments."}]}, "correct": true}

Barcelona, capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant, on the Mediterranean coast. Its geographical location is between 41\u00b016' and 41\u00b030' north latitude and between 1\u00b054' and 2\u00b018' east longitude. With an area of 102.16 km\u00b2, it is situated on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Collserola mountain range \u2014with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point\u2014, as well as by the deltas of the Bes\u00f3s and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the mountain of Montju\u00efc (184.8 m). Also, from the Collserola mountain range, several hills that follow a line parallel to the coastal range rise up on the plain: the hills of La Peira (133 m), La Rovira (261 m), El Carmel (267 m), Creueta del Coll (249 m), El Putget (181 m) and Monterols (121 m).The plain of Barcelona is not uniform, but has several undulations caused by the many torrents that once crossed the land, and also has a uniform slope from the sea to the Collserola mountain range, with an ascent of about 260 m. It is crossed by several faults, mainly the one that separates the Collserola mountain range from the hills that come forward in the plain, with a northeast-southwest orientation, and the one that separates the mountain of Montjuic from the coast. The terrain is formed by a substrate of slate and granitic formations, as well as clays and limestones. The coast was formerly occupied by tidal marshes and salt-water lagoons, which disappeared as the coastline advanced thanks to the sediments provided by the rivers and streams that flowed into the beach; it is estimated that since the sixth century BC, the coastline has been able to advance about 5 km. The area of the plain was formerly crossed by numerous torrents and streams, which were grouped into three fluvial sectors: Horta stream in the area near the Bes\u00f2s river (or eastern area); the Blanca stream and the Gornal torrent in the Llobregat area (or western area); and, in the central area of the plain, a group of streams coming from the southern slope of Tibidabo, such as the San Gervasi, Vallcarca, Mag\u00f2ria and Collserola streams.The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters thanks to the protection that the orography of the terrain offers to the plain, which is sheltered from the north winds. The temperature usually ranges between 9.5 \u00b0C and 24.3 \u00b0C, on average. Rainfall is low, about 600 mm per year, and most of the precipitation occurs in spring and autumn. This scarcity meant that in the past numerous works had to be carried out to supply water to the city, including wells, canals and irrigation ditches. The vegetation of the area consists mainly of pines and evergreen oaks, and undergrowth of heather, laurestine, arbutus and climbing plants. In the past, both rainfed and irrigated agriculture was practiced \u2014mainly vineyards and cereals\u2014, although nowadays almost the entire surface area is built up.Barcelona, capital of the Barcelon\u00e8s region and of the province of Barcelona, is the most important urban center in Catalonia in demographic, political, economic and cultural terms. It is the seat of the autonomous government and the Parliament of Catalonia, as well as the provincial deputation, the archbishopric and the IV Military Region, and has a port, an airport and an important network of railroads and roads. With a population of 1,604,555 inhabitants in 2015, it is the second most populous city in Spain after Madrid, and the eleventh most populous in the European Union. Administrative divisions. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods: Ciutat Vella (4.49 km\u00b2, 100 685 inhabitants): corresponds to the old core of the city, the one derived from the Roman and medieval periods, plus the Barceloneta neighborhood, created in the eighteenth century. This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Being the oldest part of the city, it has numerous monuments and architectural works of interest, making it an important focus of tourist attraction. On the other hand, it houses the most important institutions of the city, such as the City Hall or the Generalitat de Catalunya.. Eixample (7.46 km\u00b2, 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerd\u00e1 Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands.. Sants-Montju\u00efc (21.35 km\u00b2, 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montju\u00efc mountain, which makes it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. It has a low population density, and its rate of population of foreign origin exceeds the average. It has a high percentage of green area, thanks mainly to the presence of the Montjuic mountain, as well as industrial land.. Les Corts (6.08 km\u00b2, 81,200 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarri\u00e0, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval masia. It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-nineteenth century experienced a significant urban growth with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. The population is mainly autochthonous, and stands out for its high rate of young people. The majority is middle class, although the Pedralbes neighborhood stands out as one of the most exclusive in the city. Its main economic activity is in the tertiary sector, and it is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers.. Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km\u00b2, 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarri\u00e0 and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Collserola mountain range. It is also the district with the lowest population density, mainly because it is a high status residential area, with a predominance of single-family houses. The economy is dominated by quality facilities, as well as private schools and health centers. Its population has the highest rate of higher education and technical and managerial professionals, as well as autochthonous residents, while the foreign population is dominated by the European Union.. Gr\u00e0cia (4.19 km\u00b2, 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gr\u00e0cia, incorporated into the city in 1897. It was an agricultural area, which in the early nineteenth century began to forge an urban and industrial fabric. It has one of the highest population densities in the city, since its old center is characterized by narrow streets and tightly packed houses. Its population has a high percentage of elderly people and, although the level of education is above average, most are of lower-middle social class.. Horta-Guinard\u00f3 (11.96 km\u00b2, 166,950 inhabitants): comes from the old town of Horta, added in 1904, to which the Guinard\u00f3 district, formerly belonging to Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, was added administratively. It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. During the years of massive immigration, it was an area of strong real estate speculation.. Nou Barris (8.04 km\u00b2, 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar. It is a peripheral area with a majority immigrant population, which also suffered from strong real estate speculation and even suffered from shantyism and self-construction, and which for a long time has suffered from a significant lack of assistance, infrastructure and basic services, which have been mitigated in recent times. The majority of the population is working class and has low purchasing power.. Sant Andreu (6.56 km\u00b2, 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of Sant Andreu de Palomar, annexed in 1897."}]}, "correct": true}

The urban fabric was characterized by different areas of influence, including aristocracy, institutional power, and religious orders. The first urban planning operation occurred in 1209 with the opening of Montcada street. In the late 14th century, the Raval wall was constructed, leading to the creation of La Rambla. During the Early Modern Age, the city underwent alternating prosperity and economic crisis, with the construction of the port in 1438 and the sea wall in the first half of the 16th century. In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again, and streets were paved, sewers were installed, and drinking water fountains were built. The arrival of the Bourbons in the 18th century led to the truncation of Catalonia's autonomy and the demolition of 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood for the construction of the Citadel. The 18th century also saw the establishment of the Born and Boqueria markets, the regulation of weights and measures, and the beginning of the industrial era with the founding of the Bonaplata Factory in 1832. Industrialization brought about important changes in the urban planning of the city, leading to a strong concentration of labor and auxiliary services. The first Ordenanzas Municipales were approved in 1856, and new ones were drawn up in 1891 to take into account the new specificities of the expansion.", "text": "At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area. In this period there was a notable demographic increase, and the economy was progressively industrialized, until it led to the so-called Industrial Revolution.. The arrival of the Bourbons generated a series of military engineering works, such as the castle of Montju\u00efc and the fortress of the Citadel. For the construction of the Citadel (1715-1751), 1200 houses in the Ribera neighborhood were demolished, leaving 4500 people homeless and without compensation, and the Rec Comtal was diverted. The work of Jorge Pr\u00f3spero de Verboom, it was a pentagonal walled bastion, with a protective moat and an esplanade of 120 m between the walls and the surrounding buildings. Demolished in the Revolution of 1868, on its perimeter was installed the park of the Citadel.There were also two new military roads that crossed the plain of Barcelona: the Matar\u00f3 road \u2014coincident with the current Pere IV street\u2014 and the Creu Coberta road, which connected with the Madrid road \u2014current streets of Hostafrancs and Sants\u2014.In 1753, the construction of the neighborhood of La Barceloneta began at the initiative of the Marquis of La Mina. Located on a small peninsula of land reclaimed from the sea, its layout was designed by the engineer Pedro Mart\u00edn Cerme\u00f1o, with a grid of orthogonal streets and blocks of houses of elongated plan, which is a clear example of academic baroque urbanism. In this neighborhood was located in 1772 the Clock Tower, the first lighthouse of the city; it was followed by the Llobregat in 1845 and Montju\u00efc in 1925.In 1771, the Edicto de obreria was approved, a municipal ordinance aimed at controlling private works in the city, which involved the regulation of the alignment of houses according to the layout of the streets, as well as the supervision of aspects such as the paving of the streets, the sewage system, the numbering of houses, etc. This edict established for the first time the obligation to request a building permit, accompanied by a report and the payment of the respective fees. Likewise, in 1797 a height limit was established for all buildings. During this century there was a change in the typology of private buildings, which went from the \"artisan house\" of the medieval type to the \"multi-family house\" with a collective staircase, which definitively separated work from residence.. Between 1776 and 1778 the redevelopment of La Rambla was carried out, an ancient torrent that during the Middle Ages marked the western boundary of the city, which had been populated since the 16th century, mainly by theaters and convents. At this time the inner wall was demolished, the buildings were realigned and a new landscaped promenade, in the style of the French boulevard, was designed. The paseos of Sant Joan and Gr\u00e0cia were also planned, although they were not built until the turn of the century for the former and 1820-1827 for the latter. Likewise, the street of the Count of the Assault \u2014currently New Street of La Rambla\u2014 (1778-1789) was laid out, named after Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez de Bassecourt, captain general of Catalonia, who had the initiative to create the street. In 1797 the Paseo Nuevo or Paseo de la Explanada was also created, located next to the military Citadel, a wide avenue lined with poplars and elms and decorated with ornamental fountains, which for a time was the main green space of the city, but disappeared in the urbanization works of the park of the Citadel.During the eighteenth century, the Born and Boqueria markets were established as the only two general supply markets, and in 1752 aspects such as weights and measures for the marketing of food products, in addition to coal, were regulated. 19th Century. In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked primarily to the textile industry, which in turn led to a Catalan cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, under a project called the Eixample, drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 in 1859. After the revolution of 1868, the Citadel was also demolished and the land transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.Although chintz printing was well established in Barcelona since the 18th century, the industrial era proper began with the founding in 1832 of the Bonaplata Factory, founded by Josep Bonaplata. In 1849 the complex La Espa\u00f1a Industrial, owned by the Muntadas brothers, was opened in Sants. The textile industry grew steadily until a crisis in 1861, caused by the shortage of cotton due to the American Civil War. The metallurgical industry was also gaining importance, boosted by the creation of the railroad and steam navigation. In 1836 the Nueva Vulcano foundry opened in La Barceloneta and, in 1841, La Barcelonesa began, one of the predecessors of La Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima (1855), one of the most important factories in the history of Barcelona.Industrialization brought about important changes in the urban planning of the city, due to the new needs of the economic sectors of the capitalist system, which required a strong concentration of labor and auxiliary services. Barcelona thus underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and a better articulation of the territory through a wide network of roads and railroads, which will lead Barcelona to become a colonizing metropolis of its territorial environment.. During this century, the municipal ordinances that began with the Edicto de obrer\u00eda (Workmen's Edict) were consolidated: in 1814, the Preg\u00f3n de polic\u00eda urbana (Proclamation of Urban Police) established in 84 articles all the provisions on civil building, maintenance of public spaces and various regulations on security and public order. In 1839, the Bando general de buen gobierno (General Good Governance Charter) renewed and expanded these provisions and, among other things, regulated the relationship between the width of streets and the height of buildings. On the other hand, the law of January 8, 1845 established the City Council's own attributions in various aspects such as urban planning, regulating the sanitary conditions of public spaces, as well as the conditioning of streets, squares and markets. In 1856 the first Ordenanzas Municipales (Municipal Ordinances) were approved, which brought together and expanded previous provisions, within an urban code that contemplated for the first time all aspects of civic and institutional relations in the city. For the first time, building permits were required to include an interior layout plan. These ordinances soon became obsolete due to the new Eixample plan, until in 1891 new ones were drawn up that took into account the new specificities of the expansion and new links in the city. Among other things, the area of occupation of the plots was increased from 50% \u2014established in the Cerd\u00e0 Plan of 1859\u2014 to 70%.Among the main urban planning actions of these years were the opening of Calle de Fernando (Ferran) in 1827, between La Rambla and the Plaza de San Jaime (Sant Jaume), with a later continuation towards the Borne with the streets of Jaime I (Jaume I) (1849\u201353) and Princesa (1853). In 1833 the expansion of the Pla de Palau began, which was then the nerve center of the city, with the presence of the Royal Palace, the Llotja and the Aduana. The square was enlarged and the Portal de Mar was built (1844-1848), a monumental gateway to Barceloneta from the old quarter, the work of Josep Massan\u00e8s, which was demolished in 1859 along with the city walls."}]}, "correct": false}

Ildefons Cerd\u00e0's expansion plan, featuring an orthogonal layout and wide streets, was implemented, although his vision of gardens, parks, and public facilities was largely unrealized due to real estate speculation and opposition. In the old city, Miquel Garriga i Roca and \u00c0ngel Baixeras proposed renovation plans, with Baixeras' V\u00eda Laietana being partially realized in 1895. The era also saw the introduction of the tramway for urban transport, with the first electric streetcar line in 1899. Street furniture grew during this time, with an increase in elements such as lampposts, fountains, and benches, fostered by the rise of the iron industry.\n\nThe late 19th century was marked by the installation of electric lighting, starting in 1882, and the telephone's introduction in 1877, with the first interurban transmission between Barcelona and Girona. The Compa\u00f1\u00eda Telef\u00f3nica Nacional de Espa\u00f1a was established in 1925, and the number of telephones in the city grew significantly from 2,479 in 1897 to 850,000 in 2000. Numerous supply markets, many made of iron, were constructed throughout the city, including the markets of Born, Sant Antoni, Hostafrancs, La Barceloneta, Concepci\u00f3n, Llibertat, Clot, Uni\u00f3, Gr\u00e0cia, and Sants.\n\nThe 1888 Universal Exposition had a substantial impact on the city, leading to improvements in infrastructure and modernization. The Citadel Park was remodeled, and the Sal\u00f3n de San Juan was redesigned as the entrance to the Exposition. Various buildings and pavilions were constructed for the event, with some surviving, such as the Castle of the Three Dragons and the Martorell Museum. The sewerage system was also regulated with Pere Garcia F\u00e0ria's project in 1891, and the water collection and distribution network expanded with a new pipeline from Dosrius and the creation of the Sociedad General de Aguas", "text": "Baixeras' project envisaged a thorough remodeling of the old city, and its most outstanding aspect was the opening of three major thoroughfares \u2014initially called A, B and C\u2014 to make the old city center more walkable, following Cerd\u00e0's old project. However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed V\u00eda Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport. In 1860 an omnibus line had been opened along La Rambla, but the slowness of the carriages made this means of transport not very viable. In 1872, rails were laid for its traction, which lightened the transport, with imperial model cars \u2014of English origin\u2014, pulled by two or four horses. The line was extended from the port (Drassanes) to the village of Gracia, and later from the Drassanes to La Barceloneta. One of the first lines to operate was the English Barcelona Tramways Company Limited. In 1899 the streetcars were electrified.. During these years, street furniture also grew, especially since the appointment in 1871 of Antoni Rovira i Trias as head of Buildings and Ornamentation of the City Council, as well as his successor, Pere Falqu\u00e9s, who made a special effort to combine aesthetics and functionality for this type of urban adornments. The increase of elements such as lampposts, fountains, benches, kiosks, railings, planters, mailboxes and other public services was favored by the rise of the iron industry, which allowed their mass production and resulted in greater strength and durability.. In the 1880s the installation of electric lighting began, which gradually replaced the gas lighting on public roads. In 1882 the first street lamps were placed in the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, and between 1887 and 1888 La Rambla and Passeig de Colom were electrified. However, the generalization of electric light did not take place until the beginning of the 20th century, with the invention of the light bulb, and it was not completed until 1929.Another service that emerged at the end of the century was the telephone. The first telephone communication in the whole peninsula took place in Barcelona, in 1877, between the Montjuic castle and the fortress of the Citadel \u2014in the process of dismantling but still housing a garrison\u2014. That same year the first interurban transmission between Barcelona and Girona was carried out by the company Dalmau i Fills, pioneer in the installation of lines in Barcelona. In 1884 the state monopoly of the service was established, but two years later the company Sociedad General de Tel\u00e9fonos de Barcelona (General Telephone Society of Barcelona) was authorized to operate it, which was later absorbed by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Peninsular de Tel\u00e9fonos (Peninsular Telephone Company). In 1925 the service was nationalized by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Telef\u00f3nica Nacional de Espa\u00f1a (National Telephone Company of Spain) was created. In 1897 there were 2479 telephones in the city, a figure that grew progressively: in 1917 there were about 10 .00, in 1930 26 .00, in 1960 200 .00, in 1985 750 .00 and in 2000 there were 850 .00 telephones.It should also be noted that in the last third of the century numerous supply markets were built, many of them made of iron, a fashionable element in the architecture of the time. The markets of Born (1872-1876), Sant Antoni (1872-1884), Hostafrancs (1881), La Barceloneta (1884), Concepci\u00f3n (1887-1888), Llibertat (1888-1893), Clot (1884-1889), Uni\u00f3 (1889), Gr\u00e0cia (1892) and Sants (1898-1913) were built in this way. 1888 Universal Exposition. At the end of the century, an event was held that had a great economic, social, urban, artistic and cultural impact on the city: the Universal Exposition of 1888. It took place between April 8 and December 9, 1888, and was held in the park of the Citadel, a land formerly belonging to the Army and won for the city in 1868. The incentive of the fair events led to the improvement of the infrastructure of the entire city, which took a huge leap towards modernization and development.The remodeling project of the Citadel Park was commissioned to Josep Fontser\u00e8 in 1872, who designed extensive gardens for the recreation of the citizens, and together with the green area he planned a central square and a ring road, as well as a monumental fountain and various ornamental elements, two lakes and a wooded area, as well as various auxiliary buildings and infrastructures, such as the Born market, a water reservoir \u2014currently the library of the Pompeu Fabra University\u2014, a slaughterhouse, an iron bridge over the railroad lines and several service sheds. He also designed the urbanization of the new sector of the Born, composed of a hundred plots of land, which would present a common stylistic stamp, although it was finally only partially realized.In addition to the Citadel, the Sal\u00f3n de San Juan (now Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys), a long avenue 50 meters wide that served as the entrance to the Exposition, at the beginning of which was located the Arc de Triomf, designed by Josep Vilaseca, was remodeled. This promenade featured wrought iron balustrades, pavement mosaics and large lampposts, all designed by Pere Falqu\u00e9s. Most of the buildings and pavilions built for the Exposition disappeared after its completion, although the Castle of the Three Dragons and the Martorell Museum (both integral parts of the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona), the Orangery and the Umbraculum survived, while part of the park grounds were later occupied by the Barcelona Zoo.. Numerous works and improvements were carried out throughout the city for the event: the urbanization of the entire seafront of the city was completed, between the Citadel Park and the Rambles, through the remodeling of the Passeig de Colom and a new pier, the Fusta; the urbanization of the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya began, a process that would culminate in 1929 thanks to another Exposition, the International Exhibition of Electrical Industries; Riera d'en Malla was covered, giving rise to the Rambla de Catalunya; Avenue of Paral\u00b7lel was begun; and Passeig de Sant Joan was extended towards Gr\u00e0cia and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes towards the west. The Golondrinas, pleasure boats that left in front of the statue of Columbus and offered a promenade to visitors, were also installed and still remain.. From the end of the century it is worth mentioning Pere Garcia F\u00e0ria's project to regulate the city's sewage system (Proyecto de saneamiento del subsuelo de Barcelona: alcantarillado, drenaje, residuos urbanos, 1891). It was a project that placed special emphasis on hygienism, with innovative criteria that are still in force today: it established a visitable sewerage network, 80 cm wide by 170 cm high, maintained by a municipal brigade that still performs its functions. It is a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which works mainly by gravity \u2014except for a few small pumping stations\u2014 making it necessary to have large collectors in the lower part of the city. Thanks to this project, the sewerage network was extended in a few years from 31.2 km to 212 km. Around this time, the streets also began to be urbanized with tiled sidewalks and cobblestone roadways, replaced in the 1960s by asphalt.It should also be noted that during the nineteenth century the increase in population and new industrial needs led to an increase in water consumption, which required a larger water collection and distribution network. Thus, at the end of the century a new pipeline was built from Dosrius (Maresme), with a 17 km gallery and a 37 km aqueduct that brought water to the city. The first marketing companies appeared then, the main one of which was the Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona (AGBAR), created in 1882.On the other hand, the increase in population between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the creation of new hospitals to serve the population of the new districts of the city: the Hospital Cl\u00ednico y Provincial (1895-1906) and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (1902-1930), a monumental modernist-style complex designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner."}]}, "correct": false}

The reforms are expected to result in women retiring later and working longer hours, while disproportionately impacting blue-collar workers.", "text": "Background. The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany. In an interview in March 2023, Macron said that \"when he began working there were 10 million French pensioners and now there were 17 million\". The New York Times add that in order \"[t]o keep the system financially viable without funneling more taxpayer money into it \u2013 something the government already does \u2013 Macron sought to gradually raise the legal age when workers can start collecting a pension by three months every year until it reaches 64 in 2030.\" Additionally, Macron has \"accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension \u200crules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation\".As part of Macron's pension reforms, the retirement age was to be raised to 64 or 65, from 62.  The pay-as-you-go system \u2013  raising the retirement age would help to further finance, as life expectancy increases and more start work later \u2013 would have a surplus of \u20ac3.2bn in 2022, but the government's pensions advisory board (COR) forecast that it would \"fall into structural deficits in coming decades unless new financing sources are found\". In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that \"without immediate action\" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would \"balance the deficit\" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would \"pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early\".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 \u2013 the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from.In his New Year's Eve speech on 31 December 2022, he clarified that the reforms would be implemented by autumn 2023. In early January 2023 prior to consultation with unions, Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne spoke on FranceInfo radio, stating that the government could \"show flexibility\" on the intention to raise the retirement age to 65, and were willing to explore \"other solutions\" that would enable the government to \"reach its target of balancing the pensions system by 2030\". She announced that the policy would be presented to cabinet on 23 January and debated in parliament in early February, with full details published on 10 January. Use of Article 49.3. Article 49.3 of the French Constitution allows governments to bypass the National Assembly and force through bills without a vote. However, invoking it triggers a proviso that allows for no-confidence motions to be filed in the government. Because each party tends to only vote for their own motions and against those of others, on only one occasion, in 1962, where the Article has been triggered, the government lost a subsequent no-confidence motion.On 14 March, The Guardian declared that Macron had two options \u2013 broker deals with Les R\u00e9publicains or force the bill through using Article 49.3, \"a measure that avoids an Assembl\u00e9e nationale vote [the government] risks losing\". They said that \"[m]inisters have said the government would not use the 49.3, widely condemned as undemocratic and which risks inflaming a volatile public mood\" and that \"[i]nstead, there has been a flurry of negotiations by ministers to guarantee a majority in the lower house\"; \"[u]nion leaders have said using the 49.3 would lead to a hardening of opposition and would escalate strikes\". On 16 March, it was said \"[m]inutes before MPs in the lower house were to vote, Macron was still holding a series of frantic meetings with senior political figures, and suddenly chose to use special powers instead of risking a vote, which he appeared poised to lose\". The decision to invoke was a \"surprise, last-minute decision\" by Macron, as \"he was not certain of the support of enough lawmakers\" to take the bill to a National Assembly vote.The Guardian explained that 49.3's invoking \"illustrates Macron's difficult position in parliament\", with his parliamentary party/grouping having lost its majority in the National Assembly following the 2022 legislative election. Motivations. The coordination of the strikes by all of France's trade unions has been labelled a \"rare show of unity\", with transport and energy workers, teachers, dockers and public sector workers (such as museum staff) all having gone on strike. Trade unions \"say the reform will penalise low-income people in manual jobs who tend to start their careers early, forcing them to work longer than graduates, who are less affected by the changes.\"Polls have consistently shown that the measures are substantially unpopular, as well as the use of Article 49.3 to enact them without a parliamentary vote in the National Assembly. France 24 reported that a poll from a few days prior to the move suggested around \"eight out of ten people opposed legislating in this way, including a majority of voters who backed Macron in the first round of last year's presidential election\". The American Prospect opined that earlier support from conservative members of the National Assembly for the reforms had faded away as a result of polling that showed the reforms were unpopular. The decision to invoke Article 49.3 was seen by those on the left as a \"a major defeat and a sign of weakness\" for the government, that would now be seen as \"being brutal and undemocratic\"; Antoine Bristielle, a representative of the Fondation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s think tank, commented that using 49.3 is \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" that could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\". Le Journal du Dimanche reported that Macron's approval ratings hit a low comparable to the Yellow Jackets protests. In a poll spanning 9 to 16 March, 70% of respondents were dissatisfied with him and only 28% were satisfied.It has been suggested that the reforms do not adequately tackle the disadvantage women are at within the workforce, who usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower in comparison, attributed to more part-time work and maternity leave. Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be \"a bit penalised by the reform\" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in 'physically or mentally demanding' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to \"mollify opposition\", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter\" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law."}]}, "correct": true}

It was also reported that there was \"escalated strikes\" at refineries, with a blockade of an unspecified refinery in southern France having began earlier in the day. A CGT representative claimed that strikes would \"force the shutdown\" of TotalEnergies' Normandy refinery by the weekend, furthering the industrial action; a rolling strike was already in place there, with strikers continuing to deliver less fuel than normal from other sites.

The reforms aim to balance the pensions deficit by 2030 and create a surplus but are criticized for disproportionately affecting women and blue-collar workers.

The use of Article 49.3 to pass the bill without a parliamentary vote has been seen as undemocratic and a sign of weakness for the government.

In a poll spanning 9 to 16 March, 70% of respondents were dissatisfied with him and only 28% were satisfied.It has been suggested that the reforms do not adequately tackle the disadvantage women are at within the workforce, who usually retire later than men and with pensions 40% lower in comparison, attributed to more part-time work and maternity leave. Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be \"a bit penalised by the reform\" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in 'physically or mentally demanding' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to \"mollify opposition\", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter\" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law. At the other end of the scale, it has been reported that some are concerned about \"being forced to retire later because older adults who want to work but who lose their jobs often face age discrimination in the labor market\".. Those opposed to the reforms argue \"the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers\", and have \"disputed the need for urgency\", The New York Times saying they contest that \"Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy\". In addition, opponents opine that Macron has \"exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies\", and that \"the official body that monitors France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits\", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, \"were hard to accurately predict\".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France's political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him, having \"struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'\".

During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which \"were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system\". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" and could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\". Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support \u2013 unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) \u2013 and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'initiative partag\u00e9e (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done \"before the enactment of the law\"; yet, according to St\u00e9phane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated \"the retirement age cannot exceed 62\". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, \"thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work.\"Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, \"several appeals\" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would \"argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances\", and that \"[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'\u00c9tat (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional\".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised. The author of a biography of the late Queen Elizabeth II, Stephen Clarke, said it was \"very bad timing\", and that while the people of France would \"normally ... welcome a British king\", \"in this moment, people protesting are on high alert for any sign of privilege and wealth\"; Associated Press (AP) commented that \"what was meant to be a show of bonhomie and friendship ... instead ... is being seen as an unnecessary display of hereditary privilege\". He added that the King and Queen Consort's plans to attend a \"lavish dinner at the former royal residence, the Versailles Palace\", \"does not look good\", and \"seems very 1789\". Associated Press clarified that the \"lavish Versailles, once the dazzling center of royal Europe, is a potent symbol of social inequalities and excess\". The Daily Telegraph reported that the banquet, intended to take place on 27 March, could be cancelled or moved.EELV MP Sandrine Rousseau called for the trip to be cancelled, asking if \"the priority [is] really to receive Charles III at Versailles? Something is taking place within French society... the priority is to go and talk to society which is rising up.\"On 23 March, Associated Press reported how the CGT's members at Mobilier National (the institution in charge of providing flags, red carpets and furniture for public buildings) \"would not help prepare a Sunday reception for the king upon his arrival in Paris\"; in response, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said \"non-striking workers would set up the necessary accoutrements for the trip\". On 23 March, unions called for their tenth day of nationwide action for 28 March, coinciding with the last full day of the state visit.On 24 March, at the request of the French Government, the state visit was postponed. Macron reportedly decided it would no longer be feasible or appropriate for the visit to take place once unions announced the tenth day of national walkouts on the 28 March, during the state visit. \u00c9ric Ciotti, leader of the Republicans said the cancellation brought \"shame on our country\", while M\u00e9lenchon was of an opposing mood, \"delighted\" that the \"meeting of kings at Versailles\" had been broken up, and that \"the English knew that France's interior minister was pathetic on security\". The visit was rescheduled for some time in the summer, \"when things calm down again\". International reactions. Iran condemned what it called France's repression of protests. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said \"We call on the French government to respect human rights\" and further added \"instead of creating chaos in other countries, listen to the voice of your people and avoid violence against them.\"France's Human Rights League has accused the authorities of disproportionate and dangerous use of public force, undermining citizens' right to protest. The league's president said \"The authoritarian shift of the French state, the brutalisation of social relations through its police, violence of all kinds and impunity are a major scandal.\"Rights groups and independent bodies, including the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, have criticized French police for resorting to excessive force and for making preventative arrests that could amount to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The French Defender of Rights noted on March 21 that \"this practice may induce a risk of disproportionately resorting to custodial measures and fostering tensions.\" Human Rights Watch told AFP it was very concerned about \"what appears to be abusive police practices.\"According to Reporters Without Borders, several \"clearly identifiable\" journalists were assaulted by security forces during the demonstrations.On March 20, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association warned French authorities that \u201cpeaceful demonstrations are a fundamental right that the authorities must guarantee and protect. Law enforcement officers must facilitate them and avoid excessive use of force.\u201dThe Council of Europe condemned France's crackdown on protests and warned that sporadic acts of violence could not justify \"excessive use of force by agents of the state.\"White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated \"We support the right of people to protest and to express their opinions\" when asked about the situation in France.Dimitris Koutsoumpas, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece, attended a rally in Paris on 23 March; in a statement from Bastille Square, expressing his solidarity with the \"struggle of the French people ... against anti-labor policies, against the anti-popular choices\" utilised by both the French and the Greek governments in order to ensure the working people \"finally win\" and \"pave the way for their own interests and not the interests and profits of the few.\" The International Anthem was played over loudspeakers, with the railway workers and trade unionists being spoken to offering him a \"Friends of the Paris Commune\" handkerchief."}]}, "correct": false}

Multiple outlets, including media and unions, have grown concern over the increasing use of violence in the protests, particularly in the days since the government invoked Article 49.3, with comparisons made to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests of the first years of Macron's presidency. On 19 March, The Guardian commented that as \"police brace[d] for a week of unpredictable, spontaneous protests in cities and small towns across France, the mood of anger was likened to the start of the gilets jaunes protests\". On 20 March, Reuters also voiced that the tone of the protests had deteriorated to, and were \"reminiscent\" to, that of the Yellow Vest protest in recent days. Euronews, on 21 March, claimed that \"government insiders and observers have raised fears that France is again heading for another bout of violent anti-government protests\". On 22 March, Reuters outlined that \"[p]rotests against the bill have drawn huge crowds in rallies organised by unions since January\", of which \"[m]ost have been peaceful, but anger has mounted since the government pushed the bill through parliament without a vote last week\"; \"[t]he past six nights have seen fierce demonstrations across France with bins set ablaze and scuffles with police\".France 24 commented that unions had been \"united in coordinating their protests\", but that \"many expressed fears they could lose control of the protests as more radical demonstrators set the tone\". Fabrice Coudour, a leading representative for the 'hard-left' CGT, commented that \"tougher action ahead, more serious and further-reaching\" was possible that could \"escape our collective decision-making\". Jean-Marie Pernot, a political scientist specialising in trade unions, said that a lack of \"respect [for] any of the channels meant for the expression of dissent, it will find a way to express itself directly\". One of the Yellow Vests' \"prominent spokesmen\", Jerome Rodrigues, spoke to protesters outside the National Assembly after the invoking of Article 49.3 on 17 March, that \"the objective was now nothing less than \"the defeat\" of the president.\"Head of the UNSA trade union federation, Lauren Escure, admitted that \"when there is this much anger and so many French people on the streets, the more radical elements take the floor\", and that it was not something they would want, but was inevitable, and \"will be entirely the government's fault,\" he told AFP. The heads of two 'moderate' unions, Cyril Chabanier of CFTC and Laurent Berger of CFDT, expressed that unions were concerned. Cabanier said that an impression that \"it is just violence that pays\" was being created, and that \"[t]here are some people who are very angry, [and] the anger leads to greater radicalisation and radicalisation unfortunately leads to violence\". Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24's words, \"achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations\". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be \"withdrawn\", that his union \"condemn[s] violence\", but added \"look at the anger. It's very strong, even among our ranks\".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that \u2013 alongside the leader of the Republicans' office being vandalised \u2013 other MPs from the party were \"receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day\". Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Meunier told BFMTV that \"[i]t's as if tomorrow they want to decapitate us\", and that the emails being received \"amounted to harassment\". The constituency offices of Renaissance MPs \u2013 the party from which Macron originates \u2013 were also targeted. BBC News's Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, on 22 March, said that the protests in recent days had been \"spectacular, sometimes, visually\" but \"not huge in terms of scale\" and \"mostly .. the work of very committed left-wingers, class-warrior types, who are leading the battle\".

On 14 April, the Constitutional Council delivered its verdict on the pension bill, declaring it to be compatible with the Constitution. Prior to the ruling being made public, French Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne had said that the proposal was \"nearing the end of its democratic process,\" and said there were \"no winners or losers.\" Macron signed the bill later that same day. Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said the government is already working hard to implement the changes by 1 September. Before the Constitutional Council's decision, Macron invited labour unions to meet with him.

On 17 April, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to a government action plan in the next 100 days to decrease anger over the pension reform. Macron had also acknowledged the anger over the increasing prices jobs that didn't \"allow too many French people to live well\". Macron also stated that he wanted the Prime Minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, to take measure on work, law and order, education, and health conditions and issues. 19 April. During Emmanuel Macron's tour of France, protesters gathered in Muttersholtz, wearing CGT vests and held unwelcoming signs and banners, including one banner which threatened to cancel the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics if Macron did not withdraw the pension reform. The protesters, who banged pots and pans in order to be heard, were pushed back by police in numerous locations across the country. 20 April. Continuing his tour, Emmanuel Macron was jeered by crowds in eastern France in S\u00e9lestat, in Alsace. Locals chanted for Macron to resign and some heckled him. Macron noted that the incidents would not stop him from making visits across France. 1 May. After the calling for mass new protests on International Workers' Day, clashes erupted between protesters and security forces on 1 May. French President Emmanuel Macron was greeted with pot-bashing and jeers as he toured the country. During the tour, Macron thanked the French workers to their contributions to the nation, however he did not mention the ongoing protests. Effigies of Macron and Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin were abused or burned across France, including the city of Strasbourg. In Paris, windows were broken at banks and estate agents, projectiles were thrown at law enforcement, including one who was hit with a Molotov cocktail, suffering severe burns to his face and hands. Tear gas was deployed by police officers in the cities of Toulouse and Nantes, and property damage occurred in Nantes, Lyon, and Marseille. That day, 2.3 million people protested according to the protest organizers, while 800,000 protesters were estimated by French authorities. 108 police officers were injured in the clashes, 19 seriously injured in Paris, and 291 protesters were arrested. 2 May. After the May Day protests, French trade unions on 2 May announced a new day of nationwide protests against Macron's pension reform, setting the future protests on June 6. The next round marks the 14th wave of protests since the signing of the reform. The government responded that it wanted to \"move on\" to other issues and stated that it will send invitations to the unions for talks, and that the government would use it to reaffirm their opposition to the pension reform and work on proposals to improve workers' conditions. 3 May. On 3 May, France's Constitutional Council rejected a second bid for pension referendum by political opponents. The council issued a statement stating that the proposed referendum failed the legal criteria, which was defined in the constitution, and it also failed to address the required reform regarding social policy. As a result, protests ensued, including some in the financial district of Paris. While the protests continued, Nasser Kanaani, spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, called on the French government to refrain from violence against protesters. 8 May. While Macron celebrated Victory Day, law enforcement banned gatherings in Paris and Lyon. In Lyon, several streets were closed to traffic, public transportation was disrupted, and some parking was prohibited. Despite the restrictions, protests and bangs of pots and pans followed, in which authorities responded with tear gas being spread. Clashes also erupted at Montluc prison, where Macron paid tribute to a leading resistance figure, Jean Moulin, when protesters attempted to break through a riot police cordon, who were deployed to keep them away from the French president. 19 May.

A strike by waste collectors began on 6 March, which included a blockade of the city's incinerators. Originally set to last nine days, it was extended by another five on 15 March. As of 15 March, \"bin lorries [were] grounded at depots and at least three waste incinerators in the Paris area [were] at a standstill\".The impact of the waste workers' strike has left thousands of tonnes of rubbish uncollected on the streets of Paris. On 17 March, it was estimated the amount was 10,000 tonnes, up from 7,600 earlier in the week. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said that \"strikers were being forced back under emergency powers designed to safeguard essential services\", and from the morning of 17 March told RTL radio that \"requisitioning is working and bins are being emptied\", although this was disputed by an aide of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Hidalgo has maintained her support for the strikers despite efforts by government to break it, with the deputy mayor in charge of waste, Colombe Brossel, commenting that \"any demand to force strikers back to work would be \"an attack on the constitutional right to strike\".\"Paris' municipal waste collectors started its strike and blockade of the city's incinerators twelve days earlier; the proposed pension reforms would raise their retirement age from 57 to 59. Waste collection in Paris is split around half-and-half between them and private companies, who remained in operation with some taking contracts to operate in areas worst hit by the strike action; such as the ninth district, whose mayor, Delphine Burkli, suggested \"calling in the army to clear the streets.\"Waste collection strikes also affected Antibes, Rennes, and Le Havre.On 18 March, the mayor of Paris' 12th district, Emmanuelle Pierre-Marie, said that the priority was food waste in the streets \u2013 AP describing the \"uncollected garbage\" as having \"become a visual and olfactory symbol of the actions to defeat the president's pension reform plan\" \u2013 \"because it is what brings pests to the surface\" and that they \"are extremely sensitive to the situation. As soon as we have a dumpster truck available, we give priority to the places most concerned, like food markets.\" It was claimed that police had \"requisitioned garbage workers to clean up some neighborhoods\".As of 19 March, Philippe Martinez from CGT had \"urged\" Paris collection workers to continue their now-two-week-long strike.The strike was suspended on 29 March due to declining participation, partly due to requisitions order by the Paris police. Actions of police (violent behaviour; outcome of arrests). Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were \"charged with actual offences\". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a \"clear reason why\", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were \"rounded up\", police justifying the arrests for their \"participation in a group with a view to preparing violence\", or \"concealing their faces\"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to \"file a collective complaint against the police for \"arbitrary detention\" and \"obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate\".\"Such \"arbitrary police custody\", \"mass-arrest\", tactics have been accused \u2013 by politicians, judges and lawyers alike \u2013 of being utilised \"simply to frustrate the protest movement\", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a \"repression of the social movement\". This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used \"criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom,\" said Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods\". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a \"judicialisation of policing\" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of \"participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage\"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the \"violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests\" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Cl\u00e9ment Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that \"there are no unjustified arrests\", and people are questioned for \"offences which, in our eyes, are constituted\" and \"48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short\". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding \"when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others\"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the \"manoeuvre is risky\", as they \"expose the workforce, monopolise officers\" and \"risk radicalising the demonstrators\".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the \"police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week\". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were \"on pretty brutal form\" \u2013 stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press \u2013 and were also throwing their stun grenades with \"abandon\". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be.

Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support \u2013 unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) \u2013 and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'initiative partag\u00e9e (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done \"before the enactment of the law\"; yet, according to St\u00e9phane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated \"the retirement age cannot exceed 62\". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, \"thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work.\"Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, \"several appeals\" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would \"argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances\", and that \"[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'\u00c9tat (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional\".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised. The author of a biography of the late Queen Elizabeth II, Stephen Clarke, said it was \"very bad timing\", and that while the people of France would \"normally ... welcome a British king\", \"in this moment, people protesting are on high alert for any sign of privilege and wealth\"; Associated Press (AP) commented that \"what was meant to be a show of bonhomie and friendship ... instead ... is being seen as an unnecessary display of hereditary privilege\". He added that the King and Queen Consort's plans to attend a \"lavish dinner at the former royal residence, the Versailles Palace\", \"does not look good\", and \"seems very 1789\". Associated Press clarified that the \"lavish Versailles, once the dazzling center of royal Europe, is a potent symbol of social inequalities and excess\". The Daily Telegraph reported that the banquet, intended to take place on 27 March, could be cancelled or moved.EELV MP Sandrine Rousseau called for the trip to be cancelled, asking if \"the priority [is] really to receive Charles III at Versailles? Something is taking place within French society... the priority is to go and talk to society which is rising up.\"On 23 March, Associated Press reported how the CGT's members at Mobilier National (the institution in charge of providing flags, red carpets and furniture for public buildings) \"would not help prepare a Sunday reception for the king upon his arrival in Paris\"; in response, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said \"non-striking workers would set up the necessary accoutrements for the trip\".

ASEAN affirms its solidarity with the Governments and peoples of Turkiye and Syria in these trying times and stands ready to extend its assistance to the relief efforts. European Union (EU). The European Union's European Civil Protection Mechanism, in which Turkey participates despite not being a member of the EU, was activated at the request of Turkey. The EU dispatched thirty-one rescue teams and five medical teams from 23 member states to Turkey, committed \u20ac3 million and \u20ac3.5 million to Turkey and Syria respectively, and announced a donor conference to raise money. The Copernicus Programme was also activated to provide emergency mapping services and other help. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that member countries were mobilizing support. The Strategic Airlift Capability was used to transport search and rescue equipment. NATO deployed \"fully equipped semi-permanent shelter facilities\" to house displaced persons in Turkey. Flags at NATO headquarters were also lowered to half-mast. A vessel carrying the first 600 of 1,000 containers for temporary housing left Taranto, Italy for Turkey to accommodate at least 4,000 people. United Nations (UN). Several United Nations agencies announced coordinated responses to the disaster, including UNDAC, OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM. The World Health Organization's Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said the organization's regional offices were assisting international efforts to transport medicine and relief equipment. The UN released $25 million from its emergency fund for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria. A second $25 million grant was released for relief efforts in Syria. UN sent humanitarian aid to Syria through Turkey via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. On 14 February, the UN appealed for \u20ac396 million to help survivors in Syria. World Bank. The World Bank said it would provide US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey to support the relief and recovery process. \"We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground,\" said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\u202f7. However, professor Hasan S\u00f6zbilir, Director of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\u202f6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\". Erdo\u011fan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuo\u011flu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdo\u011fan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmara\u015f, were used to dispute Erdo\u011fan's claim.In Ad\u0131yaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailo\u011flu, and governor, Mahmut \u00c7uhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdo\u011fan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdo\u011fan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdo\u011fan said \"We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,\" In another video, he said \"We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,\"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce.

After a destructive earthquake struck \u0130zmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in \u0130zmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdo\u011fan.

He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; \u00a33.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. \u0130smail Palako\u011flu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbak\u0131r Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".A week after the earthquakes in Samanda\u011f, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary \"because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes,\" The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\" Ali Babacan, leader of the Turkey's opposition group, Democracy and Progress Party, also criticized the block.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement critical of fines and penalties issued to Halk TV, Tele1, and Fox over their coverage of the earthquake by the Radio and Television Supreme Council. In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ's statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over \"provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic\" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozda\u011f, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened.

In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozda\u011f said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey.

International humanitarian assistance began entering northwestern Syria on 9 February via Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. The first convoy of six trucks carried tents and sanitary items. Turkey said it was working to open two additional border crossings. On 10 February, 14 trucks carrying aid crossed from Turkey into Syria, according to the United Nations. The United States Central Command announced it would cooperate with Syrian Democratic Forces to assist the affected population in Syria. On 11 February, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Aleppo, accompanying a shipment of emergency medical supplies. On 12 February, all schools across Syria, except for those in the affected areas, were resumed since the earthquakes struck. Schools in Aleppo, Lattakia, Hama and Idleb remained closed. On 14 February, the Syrian government agreed to open the border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Ra\u00e9e for three months.President al-Assad met UN relief chief Martin Griffiths met on 21 March to discuss post-earthquake recovery and aid. International humanitarian efforts. Countries. Arab League. Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit called for international assistance to help those affected by \"this humanitarian catastrophe\". ASEAN. The Secretariat of ASEAN expressed its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the Governments and peoples of the affected countries, especially the families of the victims of the earthquake. ASEAN affirms its solidarity with the Governments and peoples of Turkiye and Syria in these trying times and stands ready to extend its assistance to the relief efforts. European Union (EU). The European Union's European Civil Protection Mechanism, in which Turkey participates despite not being a member of the EU, was activated at the request of Turkey. The EU dispatched thirty-one rescue teams and five medical teams from 23 member states to Turkey, committed \u20ac3 million and \u20ac3.5 million to Turkey and Syria respectively, and announced a donor conference to raise money. The Copernicus Programme was also activated to provide emergency mapping services and other help. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that member countries were mobilizing support. The Strategic Airlift Capability was used to transport search and rescue equipment. NATO deployed \"fully equipped semi-permanent shelter facilities\" to house displaced persons in Turkey. Flags at NATO headquarters were also lowered to half-mast. A vessel carrying the first 600 of 1,000 containers for temporary housing left Taranto, Italy for Turkey to accommodate at least 4,000 people. United Nations (UN). Several United Nations agencies announced coordinated responses to the disaster, including UNDAC, OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM. The World Health Organization's Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said the organization's regional offices were assisting international efforts to transport medicine and relief equipment. The UN released $25 million from its emergency fund for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria. A second $25 million grant was released for relief efforts in Syria. UN sent humanitarian aid to Syria through Turkey via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. On 14 February, the UN appealed for \u20ac396 million to help survivors in Syria. World Bank. The World Bank said it would provide US$1.78 billion in aid for Turkey to support the relief and recovery process. \"We are providing immediate assistance and preparing a rapid assessment of the urgent and massive needs on the ground,\" said World Bank President David Malpass. Reactions. Criticism of the Turkish government. The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\u202f7. However, professor Hasan S\u00f6zbilir, Director of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw\u202f7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw\u202f6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\". Erdo\u011fan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuo\u011flu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdo\u011fan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmara\u015f, were used to dispute Erdo\u011fan's claim.In Ad\u0131yaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailo\u011flu, and governor, Mahmut \u00c7uhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdo\u011fan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdo\u011fan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdo\u011fan said \"We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,\" In another video, he said \"We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,\"Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Ad\u0131yaman; 14,719 in Diyarbak\u0131r; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmara\u015f; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. After a destructive earthquake struck \u0130zmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in \u0130zmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdo\u011fan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown."}]}, "correct": true}

His strong performances helped Marist win the 1931 Fox Memorial championship. List's play was characterized by his straight running, powerful attacks, and ability to create openings for his teammates. His performances led to his selection for the North Island team and he played a key role in their victory over the South Island.

List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13\u20136 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was \u201ceasily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards\u201d. He \u201cat centre, was brilliant in patches\u201d. List then scored two tries in Kingsland's 13\u20135 win over Newton. He \u201cgave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago\u201d. The Sun said he \u201cplayed a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday\u201d. In a 18\u201316 loss to Ellerslie he scored a try and was involved with 2 others. His last two matches of the season came against City Rovers. The first was in an upset 14\u201313 win against the championship runners up. He scored two of their tries. He was \u201cthe pick of the three-quarters\u201d. His final match was a week later in a Roope Rooster round one loss to the same opponent by 31 to 13. List joins Marist with Kingsland merger 1931. In 1931 Kingsland was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys. Auckland Rugby League felt that the senior grade had too many teams with 8 and that the competition was weaker than when it had 6 for the majority of the previous 2 decades and as a result was drawing smaller crowds. They also decdided to create a reserve grade competition. Kingsland were essentially facing losing their entire playing squad with relegation to a senior B grade so they instead chose to merge with Marist. With Marist able to draw on the best players from Kingsland they were suggested as the early favourites to win the competition. They already had a strong back line with 4 New Zealand representatives and it was said that List \u201cis likely to play back row forward, a position to which he should easily accustom himself\u201d.List scored a try on debut for his \u2018new team\u2019 in an 11\u201310 win over Richmond Rovers, though the game had gone for longer than it should have and Auckland Rugby League ordered it to be replayed at a later date. His try came 2 minutes after the bell should have been rung and gave Marist the \u2018win\u2019. It was \u201ca characteristic hard dash and dive when there was little room to manoeuvre in\u201d. He crossed the line \u201camid spectators\u201d. Although it was also reported that \u201cList, on the wing, was never prominent until he scored the winning try\u201d. The following week in a 20\u20139 win over Ponsonby List scored another try and kicked a drop goal. He missed their next match through injury. In their round 7 win over Devonport by 11-4 he \u201crepeatedly broke through\u201d. Then in an 8\u20133 win over Richmond List scored another try and was said \u201cto be profiting by the association\u201d with New Zealand international Hec Brisbane in the back line. List scored 2 more tries in Marist's 25\u201310 win over Ponsonby on July 4, and then the following week in a 17\u20139 win over Newton he impressed with his strong runs and he also kicked forcefully\u201d. In an 18\u201310 win over City on July 18 it was said \u201cList at centre was in good form, and took a power of stopping once in his stride. He gave his wingers plenty of room to work in, and sent Pat Meehan over for a try with a well timed pass. List\u2019s handling has improved greatly since throwing in his lot with the greens, and he should go close to rep. honours this season\u201d. The selection of the North Island team was approaching and the Herald said \u201c[Pat] Meehan and List (Marist) have strong claims as wing three-quarters\u201d.Marist then traveled to Wellington in their bye round to play a Wellington combined clubs side. Marist won 40\u201319 with List scoring one of their tries at Wellington Show Stadium. He scored another try on August 1 against the combined Ellerslie-Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]]. Their final round match against Devonport was to decide the title with the teams tied for first. Marist won 12\u20135 to claim the 1931 Fox Memorial championship. List \u201cbeat Seagar on three or four occasions\u201d during the first half.List was then selected by Thomas McClymont to make his second appearance for North Island in their inter island match with the South Island. In some remarks by the Herald they said \u201cList is playing in good form at present and deserves a place in the three-quarter line\u201d. They also suggested he \u201chas all the credentials of a fullback\u201d. The North Island won at Carlaw Park by 52 points to 23. List scored 3 tries at centre, the first coming when he \u201cfended his way through in fine style\u201d before two more in the second half. He was playing opposite Jim Amos who \u201cshowed up at centre at times, but was no match for List\u201d. He was said to have \u201cplayed splendid football\u201d. List also kicked a second half conversion and was involved in one of Meehan's 4 tries and a try for Abbott. The Herald also said that \u201cList was perhaps the best of the three-quarters. Powerful, straight running makes List a dangerous back\u201d.List then played for Marist against a Lower Waikato side at Steele Park in Hamilton, before being defeated by Devonport in the Roope Rooster semi finals. He set up both Marist tries in their 11\u20138 loss. He was said to have been \u201cthe best back on the ground. His straight running on attack and strong fending paved the way for Marist\u2019s two tries. With more of the ball List might easily have given Marist the victory\u201d.That was to be his final game of the season after he suffered an injury. He missed the Stormont Shield final with Devonport which Marist lost. The Star said \u201cit was evident that the losers sadly missed their thrustful and brilliant centre three-quarter, List, who was unable to appear owing to having an injured hand\u201d. The Herald said that he had \u201can injured wrist and it is thought a bone has been broken\u201d. He was still however named to practice for Auckland's match against Northland but was ultimately unavailable to play. He also missed the combined Marist-Devonport sides match against the touring Eastern Suburbs from Sydney. New Zealand selection v England. The 1932 season was to be the most significant of List's career. For Marist he scored 9 tries which was the most of any player in Auckland. While he also played in all 3 test matches for New Zealand against England. In addition he played for Auckland, an Auckland XIII, and the North Island once more. His season started with 10 matches for Marist which was the entire Fox Memorial first grade championship. Marist finished runner up, 4 points behind Devonport. In the 4th round match against Ponsonby on May 21 he scored 2 tries. He, \u201con the wing, was one of the best backs\u201d. His second try came after following his own kick which gave Marist a 23\u201312 win. Against Devonport on May 28 in an 11\u201311 draw he was \u201ceasily the best Marist three-quarter. His straight running was a thorn in Devonport\u2019s side\u201d. In the New Zealand Herald on June 15 an article was written about some backs which could be chosen to play against England on their upcoming tour. They suggested that \u201cbacks capable of taking knocks which they will undoubtedly get when opposed by the Englishmen, are necessary. Brisbane, List, Davidson and Seagar are players who have set a high standard in tackling this season and are the type most likely to stop the swift and determined attacks of the visitors\u201d. In another draw, against city, 13-13 List \u201cplayed most brilliantly at centre in the first half, displaying great speed at times\u201d. He \u201cessayed several sparkling runs, in which he showed an elusive side-step. The City defence seemed reluctant to tackle low and the Marist three-quarter took advantage of this to exploit a powerful fend with good effect\u201d. A week later in a 25\u201321 loss to Ponsonby \u201cList was the star of the rear divisions, his vigorous straight running and clever moves paving the way for openings, exciting unstinted admiration\u201d. List scored a try and was involved in two others, the second when he \u201craced 50 yards, and passed to McDonald\u201d who scored. He \u201covershadowed\u201d Brian Riley of Ponsonby, and \u201cwas easily Marist\u2019s best back. His powerful running penetrated far into Ponsonby\u2019s territory. The only blot on his play was an inclination to hold on when the wing could have improved the positions\u201d.Following the end of the championship matches an Auckland XIII team was chosen to play against South Auckland on July 16 with List named in it on the wing. He scored 3 tries in the Auckland sides 29\u201313 win at Carlaw Park."}]}, "correct": true}

Despite this, he was selected for Auckland's matches against Taranaki and South Auckland, though Auckland lost the latter. List also had a dispute with the Marist club over financial issues and was suspended, leading to his transfer to Mount Albert United. He played as a forward for Mount Albert in the 1935 season, scoring 4 tries and kicking 1 conversion.", "text": "These players are worthy of inclusion in any international side\u201d.With the English tour over List returned to his Marist side to finish the season. He played in their semi final win in the Roope Rooster over Devonport on September 3. He scored a try and his play along that of Schultz \u201cwas a feature of the match\u201d. A week later Marist met City in the final and comfortably won 28\u20138 with List scoring a remarkable 4 tries. His first try came after Cornthwaite put him in under the posts, then Brisbane beat the defense and passed to List who scored again, then after a passing bout in the second half he got his third, before his last try late in the match after Webberley had made an error for City. Marist then met Devonport in the Stormont Shield final on September 17. Marist won their second trophy in as many weeks with a 15\u20138 win, with List scoring yet again.  On October 3 Marist travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki, going down 25\u201317. They then had a 37\u20138 win over Ponsonby in a Max Jaffe Cup charity match on October 8. List scored 2 tries and kicked 2 rare conversions. His final game of the season came in another charity match between Marist and a \u2018rest of Auckland\u2019 side on October 17. He score 2 more tries in Marist's 27\u201316 win. Continuation of Marist and Auckland. In 1933 List played 21 matches for Marist and scored 6 tries and kicked 1 conversion. He also played 3 matches for Auckland and scored a try. These were to be the final representative matches of his career despite playing senior club football for a further 9 seasons. List was aged 30 by this point of his career. Following a 3rd round win over Ponsonby it was said that \u201cList, at centre, was weak, dropping many passes, while also giving poor transfers\u201d. The following week against Newton in an 11\u20136 win he \u201cplayed a very solid game, and his only fault, if any, was that he did no give L. Schultz the opportunities the winger might have expected\u201d. He \u201cplayed his best game this season, handling the ball well, while his strong running was reminiscent of the player of past seasons\u201d. then in a loss to City on June 3 he was said to be the best back along with Wilf Hassan for Marist.. List was then selected for Auckland\u2019s first representative match of the season against Taranaki. The New Zealand Herald was blunt with their assessment saying \u201cList, Marist, seems to have lost all form and is lucky to gain a place. Last season the marist centre was an outstanding success against the Englishmen. It is evident the selectors are relying upon past form\u201d. He was picked at centre with Bill Turei and Roy Bright on the wings, with Albert Laing at fullback. Auckland won the match 32\u201320 at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 10,000. List was said to have not given Turei good passes and \u201cwas inclined to go too far before getting rid of the ball, but he was solid in defence\u201d. The Herald said it was List's \u201cbest game this season\u201d.. In a 35\u20139 win over Devonport for Marist on June 17 List scored 3 tries and kicked a conversion. The Star said \u201cfor the first time this season List was well in the firing line, proving to some of his critics that he has the quality of a good centre. Two of his tries were the best he has produced for quite a long time\u201d. Then a week later in a win over Ponsonby he scored 2 more tries and \u201cgave a good display, right up to his best form\u201d.In mid June List was selected for Auckland's second match of the season when they played South Auckland on July 15. South Auckland caused an upset, winning 14\u20130. The \u201cAuckland backs made desperate efforts in the fading stages to get some satisfaction, and in this Brisbane, List and Len Schultz featured, but it was all in vain\u201d in muddy conditions. He then returned to the Marist side and scored a try in a win over Ponsonby on July 29. Marist had finished runner up in the championship to Devonport, and then finished runner up to Newton in the Challenge Cup competition played over 5 rounds. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the \u201cbest of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football\u201d.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke's Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List's feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime \u201cHassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide\u201d to give Auckland a 9\u20132 lead. The Auckland Star said \u201cList did well when he came on for wing duty\u201d. List had played in the curtain-raiser for Marist against Devonport in a challenge cup competition match and so ended up playing over 3 halves of football.Following a match against Ponsonby the Marist side played against the touring St. George side from Sydney who had finished runner up in the 1933 New South Wales rugby league competition. Before a crowd of 13,000 at Carlaw Park Marist won 25 to 11. List played on the wing and marked Len Brennan who was later killed in World War 2 aged just 32. He then finished the season with a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond and an unemployed charity match against the same opposition on October 21 as New Zealand was in the midst of the Great Depression. Falling out with Marist and transfer to Mount Albert. The 1934 was an unusual one for List. He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end. At the start of the season it was reported that he was available to play again but he was not named in their early season matches. Early in the season Marist were struggling for players with some playing for their reserve grade side and the senior side on the same day. List then came out of \u2018retirement\u2019 and had his season debut in their round 3 match against City Rovers on the same day the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park. They lost 18-5 and List was said to be \u201cfar from his best, judging by this exhibition\u201d. He played better against Devonport a week later and scored a try in a 22\u201313 loss to Newton on May 26. However it was reported that he \u201cplayed listlessly, his one real sparkle being the opportune try he obtained before the final whistle\u201d on the left wing.It was then reported that there were several senior players at Marist who were in a dispute with the club over financial issues. They included C. Dunne, Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Wilf Hassan, brothers Len, Bill and John Schultz, and List. The club released an official statement on June 8 saying \u201cthat several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors\u2026Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance\u2026\u201d. The eight players were then asked to appear at the club's executive meeting the following week.List was named in the reserves for a match on June 9 but did not play, and then most of the players were suspended by the Marist club. The Auckland Rugby League had declared that the suspensions were \u201cout of order\u201d but the Marist club appealed to New Zealand Rugby League and they upheld the suspensions. List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan. Mt Albert had been seeking senior grade status and they were allowed to enter a team in the Roope Rooster along with the Papakura club. Mount Albert lost the match 19\u201311 to Ponsonby on Carlaw Park #2 field on August 18. List \u201cat centre performed well apart from faulty handling on one or two occasions\u201d.The 1935 season saw List play the entire season for Mount Albert, playing 15 games and scoring 4 tries, and kicking 1 conversion. He was now aged 32 and moved into the forwards, playing lock in their opening match against City on April 27. The following week against Richmond in a 27\u201315 loss his tackling was mentioned along with other forwards."}]}, "correct": false}

List joined Marist with the merger.", "text": "He scored a try in a practice match against Northcote on April 20 before Kingsland's opening match in first grade against City Rovers at Carlaw Park on April 27. Kingsland lost the match 21\u20136 with List scoring one of their two tries. The Herald said that \u201cList was below form and passed wildly at times\u201d. Against Devonport a week later at the Devonport Domain he \u201creceived the ball only on rare occasions, but gave a great defensive display\u201d in a 29\u20137 loss. They lost to Newton 12\u201310 with List setting up R. Carter for a try. He \u201cplayed well\u201d in the match. Kingsland then secured their first championship point with a 18\u201318 draw against Marist Old Boys. List was the best of their backs along with Christmas and Angelo. Though the Auckland Star said \u201cList, at centre, played wonderfully in the circumstances and appears to be striking good form\u201d. In a heavy loss to Ponsonby List \u201cgot through an immeasurable amount of good work\u201d. He then scored 2 tries in Kingsland's first win, by 17 points to 5 over Ellerslie. The Star said he was \u201coutstanding, [and] played sufficiently deeply to be able to race up effectively and co-operate with Angelo and Nasey\u201d. And that his second try \u201cwas a gem, a solo effort in swerving brilliance by which he cut out three defenders and the full-back\u201d. He scored another try in a 13\u20138 loss to City though \u201clacked opportunities\u201d but still played a great defensive game towards the end. The Herald criticised his play saying \u201cList at centre three-quarter, is certainly a powerful runner, but it is surprising to see a player of his experience hold on to the ball after an opportunity is presented to the wing. Had List passed more often Kingsland may have won comfortably\u201d. Against Devonport the following week he set up both of Kingsland's tries in an 18\u20138 loss.They then had their second win, 14\u201310 over Newton on June 29. He was \u201cperhaps the best of the Kingsland backs, his powerful running paving the way for two tries\u201d. He \"had little difficulty in beating [Cyril] Brimble, whose defence was weak. The Kingsland centre played his best game this season but will find it difficult to obtain a place as centre in the representative team. With good inside backs List, as a wing, is one of the most dangerous scoring backs in the code\u201d. He scored another try in their 25\u201310 loss to Marist, and played \u201clike a rock\u201d in a 9\u20130 defeat to Ponsonby.Then with Auckland representative selection looming List played a great game against Richmond with Kingsland winning 6\u20130. He scored after he \u201chad taken the ball at his feet, from halfway, and just beat Grace in a spectacular dive\u201d. He \u201cplayed a sound game. His powerful running paved the way for both Kingsland\u2019s tries\u201d.List was then selected for Auckland to play against South Auckland on July 27. Auckland won 11\u20138 with List overshadowing his opposite, Jackways. He \u201cwas at his best in the first half, and his defensive play was excellent\u201d. He set up Len Scott\u2019s try after he fielded a high kick \u201csplendidly\u201d. Though the Herald said he \u201cwas not impressive at centre, throwing many wild passes to Scott and Mincham\u201d. Returning to the Kingsland side List kicked a drop goal in a 19\u20137 win over Ellerslie. It was said \u201cList\u2019s play was a feature of the afternoon. He was always in the thick of play, his cutting in being brilliant, while he paved the way for two of Kingsland\u2019s tries\u201d.He was then picked in the Auckland Auckland training squad to prepare for a match against Northland before being chosen on the wing. He scored a try in Auckland's 22\u201319 win. \u201cCarter and List, played brightly with limited opportunity and were conspicuous for determined dashes\u201d. The Herald said that he \u201ckicked altogether too much to be impressive. The Kingsland wing would be a good scoring player if he had confidence in his undoubted pace and strength\u201d. He was chosen in the 22 man Auckland training squad to prepare for their match against Canterbury on August 24. He was ultimately picked in the side to play on the wing. Auckland won 47-18 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park with List scoring the home side's final try. The Herald said that \u201cList showed more determination than in other matches and played really well\u201d. His final match of the season was for Kingsland when they were eliminated in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition 9-3 by Marist. He \u201ccombined well in the three-quarter line [with Carter] and they were repeatedly conspicuous for strong running\u201d. He failed to make the North Island side to play the South Island a week later.. The 1930 season saw List play 14 matches for Kingsland Athletic, and once again he scored 7 tries for them. This placed him equal ninth in the club try scoring list. He only played one match for Auckland out of their three matches. Prior to the start of the season in team previews the Auckland Star said \u201cList is a steady and resolute exponent with plenty of experience\u201d. Kingsland lost their opening game to Marist 16-13 but were awarded the victory as Marist had fielded an unregistered player. List was involved in much of Kingsland's attacking work. After their round 2 loss to Devonport List was selected in the 23 man training squad for Auckland's match with Northland. He then played for Kingsland against Newton on May 10 in a 14\u20138 loss. The Sun said that he \u201cwas on form, and his deadly fend proved a regular nightmare to some members of the opposition, but he failed to run straight, and gave his wingers insufficient room in which to work\u201d.. List was then named on the wing for Auckland for their May 17 match with Northland. Auckland won the match 21-16 before a crowd of 8,000 at Carlaw Park. List had a rare poor game and \u201ca weak attempt at tackling by him let Whitelaw, the visitor\u2019s right winger, run rings around him\u201d, resulting in a try to Dunn. The Auckland Star said \u201cList by no means justified his selection\u201d, he \u201cwas uncertain in his movements, dropped passes all to frequently, and did not prove a match for his vis-a-vis, Whitelaw\u201d. The Sun said \u201cneither List nor R. Carter was very impressive. List seemed to be right off his game. He has been so long at centre that he appeared to be at a loss to know what to do on the wing\u201d.He was \"again disappointing\" in Kingsland's next match with Richmond on May 24. He \u201cmishandled at times, but was given few real chances\u201d. The New Zealand side was touring Australia later in the season so his poor form was relevant for further rep honours in 1930. He was then omitted from the Auckland side to play South Auckland on May 31 after having been named in a 20-man squad to train prior.List spent the remainder of the season in the maroon jersey of Kingsland. The following week he scored a try in a 31\u201310 loss to Ellerslie where he played well but had few opportunities. His play then turned around in a narrow 17\u201313 loss to City. He \u201cstruck his best form and was a tower of strength to his side. It was about his best exhibition this season\u201d. Both he and Carter were \u201coutstanding and were responsible to no mean extent for the showing made by their side\u201d. List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13\u20136 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was \u201ceasily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards\u201d. He \u201cat centre, was brilliant in patches\u201d. List then scored two tries in Kingsland's 13\u20135 win over Newton. He \u201cgave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago\u201d. The Sun said he \u201cplayed a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday\u201d. In a 18\u201316 loss to Ellerslie he scored a try and was involved with 2 others. His last two matches of the season came against City Rovers. The first was in an upset 14\u201313 win against the championship runners up. He scored two of their tries. He was \u201cthe pick of the three-quarters\u201d. His final match was a week later in a Roope Rooster round one loss to the same opponent by 31 to 13. List joins Marist with Kingsland merger 1931. In 1931 Kingsland was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys. Auckland Rugby League felt that the senior grade had too many teams with 8 and that the competition was weaker than when it had 6 for the majority of the previous 2 decades and as a result was drawing smaller crowds. They also decdided to create a reserve grade competition. Kingsland were essentially facing losing their entire playing squad with relegation to a senior B grade so they instead chose to merge with Marist."}]}, "correct": false}

Despite this, he was selected for Auckland's matches against Taranaki and South Auckland, though Auckland lost the latter. List also had a dispute with the Marist club over financial issues and was suspended, leading to his transfer to Mount Albert United. He played as a forward for Mount Albert in the 1935 season, scoring 4 tries and kicking 1 conversion.", "text": "These players are worthy of inclusion in any international side\u201d.With the English tour over List returned to his Marist side to finish the season. He played in their semi final win in the Roope Rooster over Devonport on September 3. He scored a try and his play along that of Schultz \u201cwas a feature of the match\u201d. A week later Marist met City in the final and comfortably won 28\u20138 with List scoring a remarkable 4 tries. His first try came after Cornthwaite put him in under the posts, then Brisbane beat the defense and passed to List who scored again, then after a passing bout in the second half he got his third, before his last try late in the match after Webberley had made an error for City. Marist then met Devonport in the Stormont Shield final on September 17. Marist won their second trophy in as many weeks with a 15\u20138 win, with List scoring yet again.  On October 3 Marist travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki, going down 25\u201317. They then had a 37\u20138 win over Ponsonby in a Max Jaffe Cup charity match on October 8. List scored 2 tries and kicked 2 rare conversions. His final game of the season came in another charity match between Marist and a \u2018rest of Auckland\u2019 side on October 17. He score 2 more tries in Marist's 27\u201316 win. Continuation of Marist and Auckland. In 1933 List played 21 matches for Marist and scored 6 tries and kicked 1 conversion. He also played 3 matches for Auckland and scored a try. These were to be the final representative matches of his career despite playing senior club football for a further 9 seasons. List was aged 30 by this point of his career. Following a 3rd round win over Ponsonby it was said that \u201cList, at centre, was weak, dropping many passes, while also giving poor transfers\u201d. The following week against Newton in an 11\u20136 win he \u201cplayed a very solid game, and his only fault, if any, was that he did no give L. Schultz the opportunities the winger might have expected\u201d. He \u201cplayed his best game this season, handling the ball well, while his strong running was reminiscent of the player of past seasons\u201d. then in a loss to City on June 3 he was said to be the best back along with Wilf Hassan for Marist.. List was then selected for Auckland\u2019s first representative match of the season against Taranaki. The New Zealand Herald was blunt with their assessment saying \u201cList, Marist, seems to have lost all form and is lucky to gain a place. Last season the marist centre was an outstanding success against the Englishmen. It is evident the selectors are relying upon past form\u201d. He was picked at centre with Bill Turei and Roy Bright on the wings, with Albert Laing at fullback. Auckland won the match 32\u201320 at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 10,000. List was said to have not given Turei good passes and \u201cwas inclined to go too far before getting rid of the ball, but he was solid in defence\u201d. The Herald said it was List's \u201cbest game this season\u201d.. In a 35\u20139 win over Devonport for Marist on June 17 List scored 3 tries and kicked a conversion. The Star said \u201cfor the first time this season List was well in the firing line, proving to some of his critics that he has the quality of a good centre. Two of his tries were the best he has produced for quite a long time\u201d. Then a week later in a win over Ponsonby he scored 2 more tries and \u201cgave a good display, right up to his best form\u201d.In mid June List was selected for Auckland's second match of the season when they played South Auckland on July 15. South Auckland caused an upset, winning 14\u20130. The \u201cAuckland backs made desperate efforts in the fading stages to get some satisfaction, and in this Brisbane, List and Len Schultz featured, but it was all in vain\u201d in muddy conditions. He then returned to the Marist side and scored a try in a win over Ponsonby on July 29. Marist had finished runner up in the championship to Devonport, and then finished runner up to Newton in the Challenge Cup competition played over 5 rounds. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the \u201cbest of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football\u201d.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke's Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List's feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime \u201cHassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide\u201d to give Auckland a 9\u20132 lead. The Auckland Star said \u201cList did well when he came on for wing duty\u201d. List had played in the curtain-raiser for Marist against Devonport in a challenge cup competition match and so ended up playing over 3 halves of football.Following a match against Ponsonby the Marist side played against the touring St. George side from Sydney who had finished runner up in the 1933 New South Wales rugby league competition. Before a crowd of 13,000 at Carlaw Park Marist won 25 to 11. List played on the wing and marked Len Brennan who was later killed in World War 2 aged just 32. He then finished the season with a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond and an unemployed charity match against the same opposition on October 21 as New Zealand was in the midst of the Great Depression. Falling out with Marist and transfer to Mount Albert. The 1934 was an unusual one for List. He only played 3 matches for Marist and transferred to Mount Albert United late in the season where he only played one match before the season end. At the start of the season it was reported that he was available to play again but he was not named in their early season matches. Early in the season Marist were struggling for players with some playing for their reserve grade side and the senior side on the same day. List then came out of \u2018retirement\u2019 and had his season debut in their round 3 match against City Rovers on the same day the new grandstand was opened at Carlaw Park. They lost 18-5 and List was said to be \u201cfar from his best, judging by this exhibition\u201d. He played better against Devonport a week later and scored a try in a 22\u201313 loss to Newton on May 26. However it was reported that he \u201cplayed listlessly, his one real sparkle being the opportune try he obtained before the final whistle\u201d on the left wing.It was then reported that there were several senior players at Marist who were in a dispute with the club over financial issues. They included C. Dunne, Des Herring, Gordon Campbell, Wilf Hassan, brothers Len, Bill and John Schultz, and List. The club released an official statement on June 8 saying \u201cthat several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors\u2026Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance\u2026\u201d. The eight players were then asked to appear at the club's executive meeting the following week.List was named in the reserves for a match on June 9 but did not play, and then most of the players were suspended by the Marist club. The Auckland Rugby League had declared that the suspensions were \u201cout of order\u201d but the Marist club appealed to New Zealand Rugby League and they upheld the suspensions. List was one of those suspended. The New Zealand Council then said that the 4 who had been suspended (Wilf Hassan had left to join Marist rugby already) could apply for a transfer. However the Marist club refused to grant them permission. List then did not play for months through the suspension before eventually being granted a transfer in August to Mount Albert United who had been in existence since 1928 but had been a lower grade side in the following years. Several of his fellow suspended players followed along with G. Flannagan. Mt Albert had been seeking senior grade status and they were allowed to enter a team in the Roope Rooster along with the Papakura club. Mount Albert lost the match 19\u201311 to Ponsonby on Carlaw Park #2 field on August 18. List \u201cat centre performed well apart from faulty handling on one or two occasions\u201d.The 1935 season saw List play the entire season for Mount Albert, playing 15 games and scoring 4 tries, and kicking 1 conversion. He was now aged 32 and moved into the forwards, playing lock in their opening match against City on April 27.

However, his performances were inconsistent, and he was criticized for poor decision-making in certain matches.

List was only named as an emergency for the North Island side to play the South Island on July 28. He was however named on the wing for the Possibles in the New Zealand trial match to be played midweek on August 1. List's Possibles side lost 27\u201324. In the first half he \u201craced away from a passing bout, and Longville scored\u201d.List was then chosen by Edward Fox, W.J. Mitchell, and W Murray, for the New Zealand side to make his national debut in the first test against England on August 4 at Carlaw Park. He thus became the first ever player to gain selection for New Zealand whilst playing for a second division club. He was named in the centres with Roy Hardgrave and Len Scott on the wings, Craddock Dufty at fullback, and Maurice Wetherill and Stan Prentice in the five eighth positions, and Frank Delgrosso at halfback. An all Auckland backline. The Herald said that \u201cList was certainly very fortunate to gain the centre position\u201d.. New Zealand won the match 17-13 causing a great upset in front of a crowd estimated at well over 20,000. List scored a try in the win. While New Zealand used the two five eighths system the English played 2 centres and had a solitary five eighth. Their centres opposite List and Wetherill were Jim Brough and Joe Oliver. England had just toured Australia where they won the test series 2\u20131. With the score 4\u20130 to New Zealand early in the match \u201cList came into prominence with a good run. He placed a punt nicely and L. Scott beat Askin and Sullivan in a follow through, but the ball went over the dead line\u201d. Then with the score 4\u20133 to New Zealand, England were penalised under their posts. Instead of kicking for goal \u201cWetherill took the ball, baffled the Englishmen by kicking across to the left flank, where List ran through, gathered the ball cleanly and dived through a tackle to score\u201d with Delgrosso converting the try. With New Zealand leading 11\u20133 in the second half Wetherill caught the ball standing still \u201cbut swept a very wide pass to List. The latter raced on a diagonal line and whipped the ball on to Len Scott. Amid a scene of great excitement, Scott tossed back his head and ran for the corner flag. Askin put in a flying low tackle, but the Shore man kept his feet and amid delirious excitement went across wide out. In comments after the match it was said that \u201cList played to form in the New Zealand centre, and made one of the tries that came New Zealand\u2019s way. The English centres, on the other hand, comparatively failed\u201d. The Herald said that \u201cList played a sound all-round game at centre\u201d.List was then selected for the Auckland Provincial side to play England 4 days later. He was in the centres, opposite Mel Rosser. The Auckland Provincial side, made up of 12 Auckland club players lost to England 14\u20139 in front of 15,000 spectators. The Star said \u201cin a subdued light List did well\u201d. He was involved in his side's first try when Hanlon cut in and passed to List who \u201cran to the fullback (Gowers) and sent L. Scott over for a fine try\u201d.  The Star noted that he \u201cdid not handle as well as usual, but was clearly hampered by the failure of the inside men [Hanlon and Amos]\u201d. List was then chosen for the Auckland side to play England on August 11. The side was very similar to the test team with 12 of the 13 players New Zealand representatives at various points. Auckland lost the match 26\u201315 with 25,000 in attendance at Carlaw Park. List played opposite Jim Brough and Les Fairclough on the English side. Early in the match Frank Delgrosso \u201cworked the blind side from a scrum. List came into the movement and passed to Hardgrave. The fleet Auckland wing short-punted over Sullivan\u2019s head and regained possession to touch down for a fine try amid tremendous excitement\u201d. Later List intercepted a pass and cleared when England were attacking through Bryn Evans, Billo Rees, and Brough.List was named as part of a larger three quarter group to play in the second test with one to be omitted. The players were Len Scott, Hec Brisbane, List, and Roy Hardgrave. List was the one who ultimately missed selection and had even been named as a possible starter on match day which was at Caledonian Park in Dunedin. New Zealand lost the match 13 to 5. He was only bracketed for the 3rd test in Christchurch as well and did not make the side with Brisbane, Scott, and Hardgrave chosen. It was not reported why he did not get selected though it is probably that he had an injury. On September 8 in a match for Kingsland against Otahuhu it was said that \u201cList was not in a fit condition to do himself justice, as the New Zealand rep. is still suffering from an injured leg. He nevertheless shone in patches\u201d. He only needed to play half the game however as the match was called off by the referee at halftime due to the behaviour of the Otahuhu players and spectators with Kingsland leading 8 to 5.List had recovered enough to be named in the Auckland  squad against Otago the following weekend on September 15. He ultimately played and Auckland won 42\u201322. He was involved in Auckland's second try when \u201cthe ball went from Delgrosso to Brisbane, to List. The Kingsland centre brought his wing perfectly into position and then swung the pass to send Hardgrave galloping across\u201d. Soon after he was involved in another passing bouth with Brisbane and Hardgrave before Brisbane scored. His final game for Kingsland came in their Stallard Cup semi final 18\u201310 defeat to Grafton Athletic on September 22. It was reported perhaps rather harshly that \u201cList failed to make an impression. The New Zealand rep. depended upon his fend to make openings. He has no variety for a centre three-quarter\u201d.On October 1 List was selected in the Auckland side to play North Auckland (Northland) on October 6 in Whang\u0101rei. Auckland won the match, played at Kensington Park by 33 points to 9. List scored the opening try after a \u201chandling bout\u201d. He was then involved in a second half try to Jenkinson after List had made \u201can opening\u201d. Kingsland Athletic and Auckland (1929-30). At the start of the 1929 season List's Kingsland Rovers club merged with Grafton Athletic in an endeavour to be admitted into the first grade competition. Their colours were maroon (Kingsland's colours), with a blue and gold shield and they would be known as Kingsland Athletic. This would be the first time List had played in the first grade in his fifth season of senior rugby league. In an article about the merger the Auckland Star featured a portrait photo of List, although they erroneously said that the Grafton Athletic club (originally named Maritime) was the original Grafton Athletic which had ceased in 1922.List played 15 matches for Kingsland and scored 7 tries and kicking a drop goal and played 3 matches for Auckland, scoring 2 tries. He scored a try in a practice match against Northcote on April 20 before Kingsland's opening match in first grade against City Rovers at Carlaw Park on April 27. Kingsland lost the match 21\u20136 with List scoring one of their two tries. The Herald said that \u201cList was below form and passed wildly at times\u201d. Against Devonport a week later at the Devonport Domain he \u201creceived the ball only on rare occasions, but gave a great defensive display\u201d in a 29\u20137 loss. They lost to Newton 12\u201310 with List setting up R. Carter for a try. He \u201cplayed well\u201d in the match. Kingsland then secured their first championship point with a 18\u201318 draw against Marist Old Boys. List was the best of their backs along with Christmas and Angelo.

The state is expected to experience a temperature rise of 0.5 \u00b0F every ten years, leading to increased wildfires, reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and rising sea levels. These changes will have significant economic and ecological consequences, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, dairy farming, wine industry, electricity, and water supply. A 2007 report, \"The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State,\" outlines specific predictions, including a 2 \u00b0F temperature rise by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F by 2040, and a sea level rise of 0.91 m by 2100.

For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington.. Three main conclusions were outlined: Climate change impacts are visible and the economic effects are becoming apparent.. The costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise.. Climate change will provide economic opportunities.:\u200a7\u200a. The economy of Washington State will dictate the effects of these impacts.   These effects are unique to Washington due to individual natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade.Climate change can directly affect the amount of resources that generate economic activity. Climate change can also affect the quality of important resources such as fresh drinking water, irrigation of crops and the generation of electricity. Climate change can also accelerate the depletion of capital assets used toward the formation of seawalls that are needed to protect shorelines from rising sea levels. Climate change can affect human health in ways that impact families and the workforce (e.g., premature death, increased sick days or leaves of absence, health care costs and insurance claims). All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington's gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State\u2014Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.  This valley owes its special characteristics (wide-open expanse, wildflowers and views) to its heavy snows and short growing season\u2014keeping it clear of trees.  Higher temperatures may mean that trees will take over these meadows, also preventing wildflowers from growing.  Scientists have already detected loss of mountain meadows on both the wetter and dryer east sides of the Olympic National Park.Forestlands comprise a significant element of Washington's economy. Out of Washington State's 43,000,000 acres (170,000 km2), 22,000,000 acres (89,000 km2) are classified as forestland. These forestlands support a great variety and number of economic activities, from timber production to the protection of freshwater supplies and wildlife habitat. In 2002, total employment in lumber, wood products pulp, and paper was 43,700. Timber collected on public land represents 16% of the current output from the lumber industry. Forest growth. Beyond affecting wildfires, climate change could impact the economic contribution of Washington's forests both directly (e.g., by affecting rates of tree growth and relative importance of different tree species) and indirectly (e.g., through impacts on the magnitude of pest or fire damage).  The impacts are unknown and may be either positive or negative.. One sees that climate change arises from changing temperature levels, soil moisture, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and other factors\u2014all of these things affecting tree growth. While estimates for changes in Washington forests are unavailable, other studies suggest the impacts to be significant.  A study of El Dorado County, California suggests a reduction of timber yields by 18-31% by the end of the 21st century, primarily because of increased summer temperatures. Pests. Beyond growth rates, climate change could affect Washington forests by changing the range and life cycle of pests.  Very little is known about the likely impacts here, and some changes could be positive, such as the possibility of the shifting of existing pests out of Washington's forests instead of attracting new pests in.  More likely to dominate, however, are the downside risks.  Washington's forests have evolved to deal with existing pests, causing the loss of such pests to be of little matter.  More detrimental, could be the introduction of new pests\u2014an example of which can be seen in British Columbia where the introduction of the mountain pine beetle, which is already native to nearly the entire Pacific coast of North America, has infested and decimated lodgepole pine forests.  This infestation is linked in large part to increasing temperatures. Electricity. Washington State relies on hydropower for 72% of its power and sales of hydropower to both households and businesses topped $4.3 billion in 2003. Washington State has the 9th lowest cost for electricity in the US. Climate change will have a negative effect on both the supply and demand of electricity in Washington.. The biggest factors determining the effects on electricity are annual temperature changes and the change in peak snowpack melt and stream flow. A change in precipitation could also have an effect on electricity supply and demand, but dramatic changes in overall precipitation are not expected. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts a 300 megawatt (about 1% of Washington's generating capacity) reduction in electricity demands during the winter for each degree the temperature rises. Summer demands would probably increase due to more widespread need for air conditioning in order to keep homes and businesses cool, although estimates are still unknown.  Washington State's reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) means that changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows are important to the supply of electricity. Pg. 38. The available electricity supply could also be affected by climate change. Peak stream flows are in the summer.  Snowpack is likely to melt earlier in the future due to increased temperatures, thus shifting the peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer stream flow.  This would result in an increased availability of electricity in the early spring, when demand is dampened, and a decreased availability in the summer, when the demand may be highest. The economic impact from climate change in Washington could seriously alter the finances of the state. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predictions for the future of hydropower are grim. The state generates $777 million in gains from power sales. However, by 2020 they expect to see this fall to a deficit of $169 million and by 2040 a deficit of $730 million. These numbers understate the production shortfalls for the state because the number of air-conditioners were kept constant at current levels.  A recent assessment on climate change in Washington done by researchers from Oregon State University has published estimates that a revenue impact of 5% or less ($165 million).. Hydropower is more susceptible to climate change impacts than other sources of electricity, so consumers may be subject to greater rate increases than consumers in other states.. Washington residents have low costs for electricity due to only a few electricity companies being investor-driven."}]}, "correct": true}

Green building techniques and innovations have been adopted in both Seattle and Washington State. Pollution, particularly greenhouse gases, is a significant issue in Washington State, with energy-related emissions being the primary source. The state has implemented measures to reduce these emissions, focusing on the transportation sector, which contributes the majority of energy GHG emissions and almost half of total emissions. Seattle has enforced a recycling ordinance to reduce waste and encourage recycling, with penalties for non-compliance. This ordinance was implemented in two phases, with educational outreach and warning notices preceding enforcement.", "text": "Green building. In February 2000, Seattle became one of the first U.S. cities to enact a green building policy. Called the Sustainable Building Policy, it requires all city-funded projects covering more than 5,000 square feet (460 m2) to achieve at least a LEED-silver rating. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is a voluntary, national green building rating system that certifies buildings for their sustainable construction and operation. Projects can receive four levels of certification - Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum. These four levels are determined by the number of points a project receives using the LEED rating system. As of May 2006, the city has 9 LEED-certified buildings, with the most notable examples being the Seattle City Hall and Seattle Public Library, both of which are LEED-silver rated. On April 21, 2005, Washington became the first state to require that new public buildings meet the LEED standard. Similar to the Sustainable Building Policy, this law covers all state-funded facilities larger than 5,000 square feet (460 m2), including school buildings.. Examples of innovative green building techniques appear here at the Green Building Features Page. Economic gains from green building. Green building has proven not only to be good for the environment but for economic gains as well. A green building can yield increased value to the owner. A \"green\" designation can also increase a buildings market value as assessed by appraisors and investors. An upfront cost of 2% to support green design would on average result in life cycle savings of 20% of total construction, more than ten times the initial investment costs. An initial investment of $100,000 to build green in a $5 million project would result in savings of $1 million over the lifetime of the building. Green building enhances the community and local economy. Pollution. Global greenhouse gas continues to increase and many nations and states. are taking actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including Washington state who has teamed up with Oregon and California in an effort to reduce emissions as part of the West Coast Governors\u2019 Global Warming Initiative. The main Global greenhouse Gas released in Washington include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and other gases that contribute to global warming. The different emission types are placed into three categories: energy, industrial processes and agriculture. Different greenhouse gases range in their individual impact on global warming. For instance, one pound of nitrous oxide is 296 times more potent than a pound of carbon dioxide in contributing to global warming. This means even small quantities of gases emitted into the environment, like nitrous oxide, can have significant impacts on global warming.. For Washington state in particular, energy related emissions are the dominant source of GHG emissions and have increased from 61.2 MMT CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) in 1990 (excluding residual fuel for transportation) to 74.6 MMT CO2-e in 2004, while their share has increased from 79% of total emissions to 85% over the past fourteen years. Carbon dioxide is the dominant GHG followed by methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Non-energy industrial global greenhouse gas emissions have lowered from 14% to 9%,. mainly due to reduced emissions from aluminum production. This has been the result of two key elements: process changes that reduced CO2 and PFC emissions per ton of aluminum. generated, and the post-2000 decline in aluminum manufacturing rates. Non-energy agricultural. greenhouse emissions have remained fairly constant but their percentage contribution has lowered as total emissions have increased. Here is a broken down list of pollution contributors in Washington State: 45% transportation, 16% in state electricity generation, 12% industry, 9% residential and commercial, 2% non-CO2 (other gasses), 9% industry (non-energy), 7% agriculture (non-energy). As you can see, the majority of energy GHG emissions and almost half of total emissions are from the transportation sector. Prohibition of recyclables in garbage. Given that about one-quarter of Seattle's garbage consists of easily recycled materials (paper, cardboard, aluminum cans, plastic bottles and yard waste) the city council decided on a mandatory recycling ordinance for its annual economic value.   The \"Prohibition of Recyclables in Garbage\" is estimated to save residents and businesses as much as $2 million per year by keeping future garbage cost low and aiding to the declining recycling rates since 1995 because the recyclable materials themselves hold value.. As of January 1, 2005 the city of Seattle (Ordinance # 121372) forbids the disposal of recyclables.  In harmonization of commercial, residential, and self-haul, garbage penalties will now be enforced if more than 10% by volume of the container is recyclables.  Enforcement with consequences began January 1, 2006.  Enforcement of the ban varies dependent upon type of pick-up. Single-family Residents: City contractors will not pick-up garbage cans that have significant amounts of recyclables.  A tag will be left instructing separation of the recyclables for the following week.. Apartment Owners/Property Managers:   City inspectors will mail two warning notices before a $50 fine is added to the apartment building's garbage bill.. Business Owners/Property Managers:   City inspectors will mail two warning notices before a $50 fine is imposed.. Recycling and Disposal Station Customers:  Self-haul customers will be asked to separate recyclables and not to dispose materials into the garbage pit.Two years prior to the enforcement of this ordinance,  in order to put the new recycling requirements into practice, Seattle Public Utilities started educational outreach programs through direct mail and an automated (206) RECYCLE phone number was established to help answer basic questions about recycling requirements.  One year later, in 2005 contractors and inspectors placed notice tags on garbage cans and dumpsters that contained significant amounts of recyclables as an advanced fair warning."}]}, "correct": false}

Higher elevation plants, such as vascular plants, will experience a reduction in habitat due to the upwardly invading tree line, while forest expansion will occur at lower elevations. Animal life, including invertebrates, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, will also be affected by range shifts, temporal mismatches, and changes in phenology. Freshwater fish will face extensive changes in distribution, and wetlands will reduce significantly, affecting their ability to absorb CO2, filter pollutants, and provide habitats for wildlife. The text also mentions the role of human activities in greenhouse gas emissions and the efforts of the Washington State government to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.", "text": "(P. 19). Like non-vascular plants, higher elevation vascular plants are expected to experience a reduction in habitat as a result of the upwardly invading tree line.  Likewise, forest expansion at lower elevations into sagebrush steppe and grassland regions are also predicted as a result of increased water-use efficiency, due in part to greater atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  This will, in turn, result in the extinction or vast reduction of many grassland and sagebrush steppe communities. (P. 18\u201320). Phenological effects will also be evident, as changes in growing season and temperatures will result in earlier leafing-out and/or flowering of many species.  This may cause temporal mismatches between herbivores and availability of key food staples, and will also be seen, perhaps with more drastic effects, in parasite/host and pollinator/plant relationships. (P. 19) Animal life. Range shifts in many species have been observed over the past century, with an average northward migration of approximately 6 km per decade.  Should an expected increase in temperatures prove true, at the magnitude of two to ten times greater than the last 100 years, even more range shifts and reordering of ecological communities can be expected. Invertebrates. The greatest impacts upon invertebrate land animals, such as butterflies or grasshoppers, will be seen in the areas of northward and vertical migration as well as a variety of phenological changes.. Changes have already been observed in the distribution of insects active year-round.  As an example, during the past thirty years, the Sachem Skipper butterfly of California extended its northernmost edge 420 miles (680 km) north into WA State.  We can expect to see many more examples of such changes in range or distribution in the future.. Temporal mismatching of species' biological events is likely to cause more complicated problems.  One such example is the potential for the timing of butterfly hatching and the flowering of their host plants to drift apart, especially in years of drought or excessive snowpack.  This may result in the complete crash or extinction of many species or populations, and may contribute to more species migrating further north.. The greatest ecological impact concerning invertebrates as a result of climate change will likely be seen in the destruction caused by insects whose populations expand in both range and lifespan, as can be seen with the mountain pine beetle throughout the northern United States and Canada.  Due to a lack of low winter temperatures to reduce the beetle populations, their range and population expanded, resulting in extreme reductions and devastation of many Whitebark Pine trees, especially at higher elevations. (P. 21)  As of October 2005, British Columbia, Canada, had lost more trees to beetle infestation than to wildfires or logging in an area three times the size of the US state of Maryland, resulting in 21,000,000 acres (85,000 km2) of infestation, and 411 million cubic feet (11,600,000 m3) of trees killed.  This has had cascading effects, especially on grizzly bear populations as pine nuts are an important source of winter time food in periods of large snowpack. (P. 21) Birds. Like other animals, the most apparent changes are expected in the areas of phenology and species and population distribution.. Poleward and upward elevation shifts have been observed already.  However, in contrast to other species, the increased mobility of birds indicates that they will likely experience expansions in total livable habitat rather than reductions.. Though phenological changes may not be as detrimental to birds, between the years of 1971 and 1995, a UK study revealed that 31% of the birds studied were laying their eggs an average of 9 days earlier in 1995 than in 1971. (P. 22) Mammals. Mammals appear to be more resilient to the effects of climate change, as little evidence can be found of its impact on their populations or individuals.  It has been established that there are genuine connections between fecundity and juvenile survival and winter temperatures.  Also, distribution shifts northward and upward in elevation can be expected. (P. 23) Amphibians. Amphibians stand to be some of the worst affected by climate change, due largely to the dependence on water regimes and need for specific microhabitats, as well as their limited dispersal abilities.  During the last century, rapid declines in amphibian populations were observed worldwide, and extinctions and reductions of amphibian species in the tropics have been caused both directly and indirectly by climate change.  Indirect effects include the extinction of many amphibian populations and species worldwide due to changes in the distribution of pathogens and diseases.  Other potential consequences include the indirect consequences of habitat modification caused by wildfires, fire changes, and changes in sea water levels and quality, as well as the direct consequences associated with rising temperatures.(P. 23\u201324). Phenological challenges are considerably more prominent in amphibians than in other vertebrates.  The calling and breeding phenology in spring has advanced.  Six different frog species in New York State have experienced a 10- to 13-day advancement in callings associated with 1 \u00b0C to 2.3 \u00b0C rises in temperature during breeding months.  Likewise, studies in England have shown an advancement of amphibian breeding by 2 to 7 weeks over a 17-year time period.  Despite these surprisingly extensive effects, some amphibians appear unaffected in any negative way by these changes. (pg. 23\u201324) Reptiles. The greatest impact upon reptilian species will be seen in changes in phenological events, but their limited dispersal abilities may also prove detrimental in conjunction with their specific physiological temperature constraints.  Reproduction and development in many reptiles has been linked directly to climate, resulting in the possibility of very profound effects should temperatures continue to rise.  For example, in some species the sex of the offspring is directly dependent upon the temperature of the egg.  With the painted turtle, a 4 \u00b0C rise in temperature would result in solely female offspring. (P. 24) Fish. Fish will likely be victim to extensive changes in distribution.  Many species, such as salmon, cannot live in water over 21 \u00b0C.  In addition to direct effects of temperature, increased volume and changed timing of stream flows are likely to cause many river-spawned eggs to wash downstream.  Another significant factor is the timing of spring upwelling.  Though unknown to what extent future climate change will affect upwelling, if at all, it is a phenomenon which is directly dependent upon climate and is essential in the survival of young fish when they reach the ocean.. The hardest hit freshwater fish habitats will be in mid to high elevations where reduced snowfall will have the biggest impact.  Additionally, stream temperatures and the potential increased presence of invasive species is likely to have negative effects on most native fish. (P. 25) Wetlands. Wetland area will reduce significantly, and most are in danger of flooding, drying up or relocating.  This reduction is bad due to the role wetlands play in: Absorbing CO2. Efficiently absorbing surplus storm water (which will be more frequent and extensive in the future). Recharging aquifers and keeping streams from drying up during dry summers due to wetlands' natural water storage capacity (P. 7). Filtering pollutants from water, helping provide livable habitats for fish and wildlife.  In Washington State, over half of all fish and wildlife depend on wetlands for their survival at some time in their lives, including bald eagles, coho salmon, and frogs. (P.1) Preparing species, habitats, and ecosystems for climate change. In 2011, the Washington State Department of Ecology released the interim recommendations of a multi-stakeholder collaboration on preparing Washington's natural systems for the impacts of climate change, as part of the Dept. of Ecology's integrated climate change response strategy. The recommendations include goals and strategies for building the capacity of Washington's species, habitats, and ecosystems to adapt to the effects of climate change, and are available here. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Current climate change is due to anthropogenic GHG concentrations. Human activities including burning fossil fuels, waste, and wood products cause CO2 emissions. CO2 is the least common type of GHG, while water vapour is the most common. Methane is emitted during coal, natural gas, or oil production. Other sources include agricultural livestock and decaying organic matter. Nitrous oxide is emitted through industrial and agricultural activities. Many industrial companies have switched from burning coal and petroleum fuel to natural gas. More toxic pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, are emitted in smaller rates and are known as High Global Warming Potential Gases.The state government regularly publishes GHG inventories. The EPA helps forward the process by providing the state with inventory guidance and technical assistance. These inventories provide the state with useful information about emissions. From here policies will be implemented and added to the State Climate Change Action Plan.Washington State pumps out 85 to 90 million tons of GHG per year. Washington is responsible for 0.3% of the yearly GE emissions. Since 1970 the amount of harmful gases emitted by the state has grown by 75%. This figure is in line with the greenhouse output trend globally. Washington produces 13.5 tons of CO2 per person per year. This number is 30% lower than the national average due to the state's reliance on hydropower."}]}, "correct": false}

There are 218 cities that have joined Mayor Nickels in a campaign to reduce emissions to at least 7% of 1990 levels. Even though the United States as a whole has not ratified the protocol, if all cities meet their goal, the joint reduction of emissions from the 219 cities, representing 44 million people, is equivalent to reductions from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries combined, says Denis Hayes, co-chairman of the mayor's Green Ribbon Commission on Climate Protection, which released the plan. Although Seattle is exceeding their goal of reducing GHG emissions, population growth fueled with their resistance to alternate methods of transportation is threatening their Kyoto goals.. For a cap and trade situation or even a tax to be truly effective they need to affect the individuals of the populations. Applying a tax to gas would greatly reduce the population's willingness to drive and make alternatives to drive more attractive. Also incentives to purchase hybrid cars, use biodiesel, and other climate friendly alternatives will greatly reduce fossil fuel dependence and use. Responses to climate change in Washington. Job growth. Forbes magazine ranked Washington State the fifth best state in the nation for business, and 3rd for environmental quality.  The emerging \"green economy\" (green collar jobs) designed to achieve efforts toward low carbon and sustainability is anchored by clean energy. WA is a national leader in addressing climate change and has taken steps to reduce its climate impact, and as a result opportunities for growth in the economy have been generated. Sustainable family wage jobs are developed through a focus on cleaner energy, smarter use of natural resources, and adoption of advanced technology. State Energy Policy Office studies documented 3,800 clean energy jobs in 1998 and 8,400 jobs in 2004. The Washington Climate Advisory Team (CAT) expects the state to meet Governor Gregoire's job creation goal of 25,000 clean energy jobs by 2020. And, Washington could potentially reach 31,000 family-wage jobs by 2025.. Clean Energy Sectors Include: Energy efficiency. Renewable energy (including solar, wind, fuel cell, geothermal, and biomass). Smart energy (using technological advances to improve all steps of the energy production to end-consumption process)Clean Energy Industry at a Glance: 241 organizations, 8,400 jobs. Average salary $60,000. More than $2.1 billion in 2004 revenues. 64% greater concentration of clean tech jobs in WA (highest per capita jobs and revenues were in Eastern WA) than the U.S. average Mitigation. The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) is working to develop regional strategies to mitigate climate change in 6 states of the western U.S., including Washington, and in the westernmost provinces of Canada. Its main thrust as of 2008, is to develop a region-wide multi-sector cap-and-trade program.In 2007, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire\u2019s executive order passed putting into effect her climate change challenge goals.. Governor Gregoire aims to: Reduce Climate Pollution, and reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.. By 2050, reduce emissions by half of the 1990 levels.. Grow the Clean Energy Economy and create jobs that use cleaner energy. (Clean energy jobs grew 45% between 1998 and 2004).. Generate an increase in job growth to 25,000 by 2020.. Move toward Energy Independence (in 2006, $9 billion were spent on imported fuel\u2014Gregoire hopes to recover that money to cycle it back into our economy by generating our own renewable fuel industry).. By 2020 reduce spending on imported fuel by 20 %.In 2005, Seattle reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% when compared to 1990 emissions. Despite Seattle\u2019s economic/population growth since 1990, energy use has gone down. Programs, such as the Seattle Bicycle Master Plan (SBMP) will reduce emissions even further by increasing the number of bike lanes and improving pedestrian sidewalks. Mayor Greg Nickels, \"Center City Strategy,\" will cluster growth within Seattle by promoting urban/compact living within its downtown and local neighborhoods. Mayor Nickels, along with 700 other Mayors nationwide, signed the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement that requires cities to meet or beat the Kyoto Treaty emission targets by 2012. Policy. To reduce the impacts of climate change, the state of Washington has enacted several pieces of legislation in recent years. These pieces cover areas such as construction, waste, water, air quality, and so on. There are different policies to pursue specifically in Washington State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to reduce GHG emissions have to take place in Washington as well as across the globe in order to minimize further warming.. As Washington State backs the need to decrease carbon emissions, the legislature is searching for ways to fund the formation of renewable energy sources. The bill SHB 1032, which would tax families and businesses to generate financial support for new renewable energy sources, has raised several concerns for taxpayers and ratepayers, and also questions as to whether this will efficiently reduce CO2. This bill would begin to tax every utility customer approximately $1.90 a month, regardless of how much energy the customer uses. This incongruous attempt would leave industrial users paying the same as poverty-level families, and is arguable for several reasons.. First, such taxation will hit low-income families more heavily than wealthy families. Second, because the fee is a surcharge, there is no way to reduce the fee by taking affirmative action in reduction of energy use. This leaves no incentive for people to reduce their use, but may in fact increase people's use since they are paying the same amount as everyone else.. Analysis of SHB 1032: Adding Subsidies for Renewable Energy Production. Executive Order 07\u201302, signed by Governor Gregoire on February 7, 2007, presented goals of decreasing emissions that contribute to global warming overall, as well as decreasing the use of foreign oil allowing for more employment in fields that make clean energy such as hydropower and solar power. Washington State has also encouraged public participation in the incorporation of clean energy practices into citizen's daily lives. The Climate Advisory Team (CAT) put together a collection of incentives for factories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The Preparation and Adaptation Working Groups (PAWGS) proposed proactive approaches to decrease or accommodate the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels. The Citizen Engagement and Action Framework (CEAF) also furnished suggestions to decrease citizens\u2019 impacts. The CEAF also encouraged the public to take responsibility in arranging actions when some of the impacts are observed. CAT's proposed reduction of greenhouse gases. Washington's Climate Advisory Team (CAT)  published its guide to reducing Washington State's greenhouse gases on February 1, 2008.  While comprehensive in nature, the report's goals can be summarized as follows:. Build market-based mechanism to unleash investment in the creativity and innovation of Washington's economy to deliver cost effective emission reductions.. Establish emissions reporting so that progress in emission reductions can be tracked and acknowledged.. Analyze greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation options early in decision-making, planning processes, and development projects.. Invest in worker training for the emerging Clean Economy to ensure having a skilled workforce and to provide meaningful employment opportunities throughout the State.. Build and continue to redesign communities that offer real and reliable alternatives to single occupancy vehicles.. Ensure Washington has vehicles that are as efficient as possible and use non-carbon or lower carbon intensity fuels developed sustainably from regional resources.. Focus investments in Washington's transportation infrastructure to prioritize moving people and goods cleanly and efficiently.. Design, build, upgrade, and operate new and existing buildings and equipment to maximize energy efficiency.. Deliver energy from lower or non-carbon sources and more efficient use of fuels.. Restore and retain the health and vitality of Washington's farms and forest lands to increase carbon sequestration and storage in forests and forest products, reduce the releases of greenhouse gas emissions, and support the provision of biomass fuels and energy.. Reduce waste and Washington's emissions of GHGs through improved product choices and resource stewardship.. Allocate sufficient state resources to maintain Washington's leadership role regionally and nationally and to fulfill its responsibilities for structuring and guiding implementation of emission reduction strategies. Green building. In February 2000, Seattle became one of the first U.S. cities to enact a green building policy. Called the Sustainable Building Policy, it requires all city-funded projects covering more than 5,000 square feet (460 m2) to achieve at least a LEED-silver rating. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, is a voluntary, national green building rating system that certifies buildings for their sustainable construction and operation. Projects can receive four levels of certification - Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum. These four levels are determined by the number of points a project receives using the LEED rating system."}]}, "correct": true}

Some residents may be very concerned about the impacts of climate change on their health, economy, and environment, while others may not view it as a pressing issue. A survey conducted by the University of Washington in 2018 found that 76% of Washington residents believe that climate change is happening, and 62% believe that it is mostly caused by human activities. Additionally, 68% of residents are worried about the impacts of climate change on future generations. However, opinions on climate change can also differ based on factors such as political affiliation, age, and location.", "additional_info": {"top_chunks_info": [{"summary_score": 0.8633979602864558, "summary_rank": 0, "text_score": 0.848426364252962, "text_rank": 2, "summary": "Climate change impacts Washington state's coastline, agriculture, and outdoor recreation. Rising temperatures exacerbate respiratory illnesses like asthma, costing over $400 million yearly, and may increase heat-related deaths, with each mortality costing $6,250. Coastal areas are at risk due to sea level rise (SLR), which may reach 19 inches by 2100, affecting 44,429 residences. Areas with low elevation, like Tacoma and Olympia, are more susceptible to flooding. SLR also threatens agricultural lands, such as Willapa Bay and the Skagit River Delta, and may cause shoreline changes along the state's 3,000 miles of coastline. Climate change negatively affects Washington's large ski industry by reducing snowfall and shortening the winter recreational season. To address these challenges, adaptability, risk management options, and climate-resilient strategies are essential.", "text": "Washington's asthma prevalence is among the highest in the nation, costing the state over $400 million yearly. 400,000 adults and 120,000 children suffer from it in Washington. Though increases in average yearly temperatures is the hallmark of global warming, human activities are the cause of greenhouse gases like emissions from cars, power plants, and airborne particles from human-caused forest fires. Global warming has a \"direct\" effect on respiratory illnesses because increased CO2 levels stimulate pollen production, which stimulates allergies. More frequent flooding in WA State will increase the growth of fungus, also exacerbating allergies. Increased carbon dioxide levels have already and will continue to increase the level of pollen output in the state. In 2001 when carbon dioxide levels were 370 parts per million the pollen output for a common ragweed was twice the level of output that plants used to give out at 270 parts per million, which was the level before the industrial revolution. One possible scenario for the coming years is that pollen count could increase to 20 grams per cubic meter. This would cause a serious increase in the need for medication for allergies and exacerbate the effects of global warming on the economy.Impact on heat-related illnesses. Heat-related deaths will increase as average yearly temperatures increase. More frequent days over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) will cause several problems for humans, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. The amount of heat waves has increased in the state of WA over the past 20 years. The average cost for each mortality from heat-related deaths is $6,250. These occur when the human body is so overwhelmed by heat that it no longer can combat the extreme level of heat. Urban settings will see even worse conditions. At night, heat levels can remain dangerously high. This is because buildings and roads absorb heat during the day and release this heat at night.  Studies of heat-related mortality in eastern WA had highs of 107 \u00b0F in 2006. Hospital charges for heat-related admissions in 1998 was roughly $6250 per patient. Coastal management. The University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group (CIG) has worked to study the factors that affect the coastal regions. One prominent area of focus for CIG is forestry practices. To help protect coastal waters, there has been a reforestation act that states that satisfactory reforestation must take place within need a number here? years after logging.  How does this citation correspond to what is cited? And what would be considered \"satisfactory reforestation?\" Research results suggest that as forest cover decreases to a point where less than 65% of the forest has surface cover greater than 10%, the conditions stray outside the norm.   Despite the research, there is still much uncertainty as to how pollution and logging will affect the climate.  In 1976, it marked the development and first ever approval by the Federal Government of Washington State's (WA) Coastal Zone Management (CZM) program. The terms and features of a state's approved CZM program are provided in what is commonly known as a state's \"CZM Program Document.\"  WA's 2003 updated program document is referred to as \"Managing Washington's Coast.\"One of the features of the federal CZM program important to the states is \"Federal Consistency.\" This simply means that any public federal project carried out by a federal agency, or private project licensed or permitted by a federal agency, or carried out with a federal grant, must be determined to be consistent with the state's CZM program.. Coastal water quality has always been an important part of the federal\u2014state coastal zone management program.  In 1992 Congress provided for increased emphasis on coastal non-point pollution.  WA, along with other states in the national CZM program is developing a Coastal Non-point Pollution Management plan.. WA also participates in the federal Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP); its purpose is to protect critical coastal and estuarine areas having significant conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, and threatened by conversion.  Although dedicated grant funds have yet to be authorized by Congress, a state plan has been drafted to assure WA's eligibility for future participation.There is also research on the effects on coastal boundaries in Oregon and California. Outdoor recreation. Washington's economy is particularly susceptible to being affected by climate change in the mountains, due to the large ski industry.. Climate change will result in more rain and less snow across mountainous regions. Earlier melting of Washington's snowpack will negatively affect conditions as well, as this snowpack is responsible for ideal slope conditions, and its water supply. The  breakdown of the snowpack occurs in early spring, leaving summer months dry and ending [winter sport|snowsports] much earlier than before. Over 40% of winter recreation in the past 10 years took place at lower elevation ski areas (Snoqualmie Summit, Mt. Baker, and Mt. Spokane ski areas are most likely to be affected by climate change). The Summit at Snoqualmie experienced \"warm winters\" in 27% of the years from 1971 to 2000, and may experience over 50% \"warm winters\" by 2040.  Washington's ski resorts contribute greatly to the state's economy. Over the last decade there was an average of 1.65 million visits per year. Annual revenue from Washington's ski areas ranges from $50\u2013$150 million for ski passes, tickets, and rentals. This does not include secondary revenues from skiers' food, retail sales, etc. The winter recreational season is shortening considerably due to less snow fall. Sea level rise. At Seattle, Washington, sea level is already rising by increments of 8 inches (200 mm) per century, and it is likely to rise another 19 inches (480 mm) by 2100.. The four main factors that contribute to sea level rise (SLR) are: thermal expansion of the ocean. melting of land-based ice. local atmospheric circulation. local tectonic movement.  The report on Sea Level Rise in the Coastal Waters of Washington State summarized the possible sea level change for the Northwest Olympic Peninsula, Central and Southern Coast, and Puget Sound region and for each made estimates for very low, medium, and very high sea level change. For the year 2050, estimated Northwest Olympic Peninsula SLR ranged from -12 cm to 35 cm with negative SLR due to the predicted upward tectonic movement. Central and Southern Coast estimates ranged from 3 cm to 45 cm and Puget Sound was estimated at SLR of 8 cm to 55 cm. These values roughly double in all regions for the 2100 projections. Homes and businesses within reach of tidewater and low-lying agricultural areas in Washington are at high risk for flooding and current developers and anyone developing or buying property will likely take SLR into account before making an investment. Parts of Tacoma and Olympia are at higher risks than other cities like Seattle, since many areas in Tacoma and Olympia are built just a few feet above sea level. pg. 65. Current estimates project that Tacoma and surrounding areas could see sea levels rise from 5 to 16 inches (410 mm) by 2040. It is said that \"shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and recreational facilities associated with coastal port districts are places where impacts will reach more deeply into the state\u2019s economy through effects on commercial and recreational activities.\" The cost of preparing for such rises is largely unknown; however, Seattle has five seawalls and plans for rebuilding of the Alaskan Way seawall may increase in cost by 5-10% based on projections for sea level rise. pg. 65.. Methods to protect shorelines are to build a seawall or to pump sand onto beaches to prevent erosion. Attempts at managing river flow for the direction of increased water levels is also a possible way to control SLR. When considering the cost to protect shorelines, it is difficult to calculate due to some shorelines being developed and others undeveloped. Agricultural factors and the potential loss of profit from SLR in that vector, is also difficult to predict and often unaccounted for. Potential development for housing is often excluded also. An estimate of potential national cost to protect land from SLR and considering such variability of land quality but excluding future value, is $270\u2013475 billion for a one-meter rise in Sea Level. Changing shorelines. Shoreline change can be defined as the erosion of the beach, when the amount of incoming sand does not equal the amount of  outgoing sand.. With over 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of shoreline, Washington State is especially vulnerable to climate related shoreline changes caused by rising sea water levels. The impact of sea level rise will depend greatly on the amount of rise which occurs, an estimate that falls between 3 inches (76 mm) and more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) within the next 100 years. An increase of two feet in sea level will cover an area of the state close to 56 square miles (150 km2) and would affect 44,429 Washington residences.  Agricultural areas such as Willapa Bay and the Skagit River Delta including Fir Island will be the first hit hard because their dikes and tide gates will be easily overrun by the rising tides.The changing sea levels will have different effects along the state's coastline.  Tectonic forces are causing the Cascade Peninsula to rise in step with the rising oceans. Other areas of the coastline will not be so lucky. Areas from the central to the southern region of the coast are vulnerable to the rising waters."}]}, "correct": false}

Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life. They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was also heard on 9 November 2021. The rushed schedule to close up on Nagaenthran's last-minute appeal process was criticised by lawyer N. Surendran as a denial of due legal process for Nagaenthran.During the appeal hearing at the High Court, the testimonies of the prison officers who knew Nagaenthran were presented in court disputed the supposed mentally ill behaviour of Nagaenthran. A senior prison officer who had befriended Nagaenthran for the past three years had not seen any abnormal behaviour from Nagaenthran, who was able to request religious counselling after being told that he would be hanged in the near future. Another prison officer said Nagaenthran had no problem communicating with the prison officers in English, Malay and Tamil, making requests and responding to instructions. Not only did he ask for religious counselling and a DVD player to play religious songs, Nagaenthran was also able to request for phone calls to his family members and for them to visit him, as well as selecting whichever prison officers who could help fulfill his needs during the final days prior to his execution. The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) earlier requested to Nagaenthran's lawyer to allow them to disclose the latest psychiatric records detailing Nagaenthran's mental state, but Ravi objected to the disclosure.On 9 November, the day of the appeal at the Court of Appeal, Malaysia's Communications and Multimedia minister Annuar Musa expressed to Singapore his hope that they could reconsider Nagaenthran's case and spare his life. At the same time, the human rights experts of the United Nations also pushed for Singapore to spare Nagaenthran's life.However, on 9 November 2021, it was reported that Nagaenthran had tested positive for COVID-19 just 12 minutes after he arrived at the Court of Appeal for his appeal hearing, and thus the execution on 10 November would not proceed as scheduled. Both Ravi and the prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong were informed of this by one of the judges in a courtroom packed with both local and international media and activists. His appeal was also delayed to allow Nagaenthran time to recover before proceeding with the appeal process. The appeal was heard by three judges: Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Kannan Ramesh.The next day on 10 November, the original date of Nagaenthran's execution, the Singapore Prison Service revealed that prior to his appearance in court, Nagaenthran did not report any symptoms and was initially tested negative by the ART test before the results of the PCR test confirmed Nagaenthran's COVID-19 infection. It was also revealed that Nagaenthran chose not to vaccinate himself from COVID-19, even though more than 90% of the prison staff and 90% of the prisoners were fully vaccinated from the virus. Several prison officers and some of Nagaenthran's fellow prisoners at the death row cells of Changi Prison's Institution A1 were also subsequently tested positive, and the affected death row cells were undergoing lockdown to avoid the infection from spreading. Nagaenthran and the people he interacted with were isolated to avoid spreading infection to more people and be given medical treatment in the meantime. There would also be measures taken to ensure regular testing of both prison staff and inmates for COVID-19. In addition to 54 supervising prison officers, a total of 169 prisoners from the prison, including those on death row, were confirmed to be infected as of 12 November 2021. Further death penalty debate and Singapore's response. The case has brought light to the issue of the death penalty in Malaysia. While many human rights groups pushed for abolition of the death penalty, most Malaysians believed that the death penalty should remain for serious crimes like murder and certain offences of corruption other than drug trafficking, and support for the death penalty remains high in Malaysia despite the decreasing numbers of new death sentences given by the courts. Legal professionals and enforcement, including some lawyers and police officers, commented that there should be some powers of discretion given to the judges to impose life imprisonment in some capital cases instead of death with respect to its mitigating circumstances, but they generally felt that the death penalty is overall still relevant to use against drug trafficking and murder and other offences, given the rampant rate of drug offences committed in Malaysia."}]}, "correct": true}

After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh.

During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. However, a psychiatric report concluded that Nagaenthran had neither of the above. He was also not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the CNB, since he did not substantively assist them in disrupting the drug trafficking activities. Despite this, on 24 February 2015, Nagaenthran brought forward the application and tried to ask for mercy based on the conditions of an intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which would have made him ineligible for the death penalty. High Court reviews. In 2017, the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's re-sentencing application. Four psychiatric and psychological experts, including one called by the defence, agreed that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled. The High Court also found that Nagaenthran had repeatedly changed \"his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed\". The High Court found that Nagaenthran showed that he was \"capable of manipulation and evasion\" during his offence, as Nagaenthran tried to dissuade Central Narcotics Bureau officers from searching him at the checkpoint by stating that he was \"working in security\", playing into the \"social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.\"In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal of Nagaenthran's case. Court of Appeal review. After the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's appeal for re-sentencing, Nagaenthran, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, filed two separate appeals to ask for the Court of Appeal to commute his sentence under the newly enacted death penalty laws, but the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on 27 May 2019. The Court of Appeal said that there were numerous inconsistencies in Nagaenthran's account of his crime, which made it hard to rely on his defence given that they affected his credibility. The five judges - Sundaresh Menon, Belinda Ang, Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, and Chao Hick Tin - held that Nagaenthran may have a low IQ, but his mental responsibility for his offence was not substantially impaired. He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently.. Besides, Nagaenthran had known that it was unlawful for him to import heroin, and hid the drugs to avoid detection. He was also prone to being manipulative and evasive, as shown from his initial attempts to avoid being searched before the narcotics officers arrested him in 2009. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was \"the working of a criminal mind\" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong. Hence, Nagaenthran lost his final bid to be re-sentenced. Clemency petition and first public attention. Nagaenthran later appealed to the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob for clemency, which would have commuted his sentence to life imprisonment if successful, but his plea was rejected on 1 June 2020, which finalized his death sentence. The last time clemency was granted in Singapore was in 1998, when 19-year-old Mathavakannan Kalimuthu was pardoned from execution despite being sentenced to hang for murdering a gangster in 1996. Mathavakannan was paroled and released in 2012 after serving 16 years of his life sentence due to good behaviour.During the time Nagaenthran was appealing for clemency, his case attracted international attention and many who opposed the death penalty asked Singapore to spare Nagaenthran's life; Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam (aged 57 in 2019) and family also joined in the efforts to plead for mercy. In a 2019 news report, Malaysian human rights lawyer N Surendran denounced Singapore for unfairly subjecting a mentally disabled man to a death sentence, and he, together with Nagaenthran's new lawyer M Ravi argued that there was no fair trial for Nagaenthran since his defence's psychiatric evidence was allegedly not fully considered compared to the reports of the prosecution's psychiatrists.Singapore's law minister K Shanmugam, in light of prior accusations that Singapore was unfairly mistreating Malaysian drug traffickers (due to the increasing number of Malaysians being executed for drug trafficking), argued that there is no inequality in treating foreigners and locals under the law for drug trafficking. He said the majority of Singaporeans favour the death penalty and it would be good for both sides if drug traffickers were caught by Malaysian authorities, as the offenders could be dealt with according to Malaysia's laws and not have to worry about Singapore's capital punishment."}]}, "correct": true}

Second death warrant. On 20 April 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) informed Nagaenthran's mother that her son's execution was rescheduled to take place on 27 April 2022, and that extended daily visits would be facilitated for the family until the eve of his execution. This announcement led to requests for the Malaysian government to delay Nagaenthran's execution by taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Upon receiving her son's second death warrant, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam appeared on Facebook in a video clip, in which she made a public apology on behalf of her son, and she begged for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran's life.By then, Amnesty International also filed a petition to seek clemency on behalf of Nagaenthran, and the petition itself garnered more than 8,000 signatures. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be \"devoid of merit\". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that \"no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum\" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: \"There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word.\" Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a \"calculated attempt\" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to \"stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice.\"After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: \"I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?\"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of \"harassing\" and \"intimidating\" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations."}]}, "correct": false}

His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities.

However, a psychiatric report concluded that Nagaenthran had neither of the above. He was also not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the CNB, since he did not substantively assist them in disrupting the drug trafficking activities. Despite this, on 24 February 2015, Nagaenthran brought forward the application and tried to ask for mercy based on the conditions of an intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which would have made him ineligible for the death penalty. High Court reviews. In 2017, the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's re-sentencing application. Four psychiatric and psychological experts, including one called by the defence, agreed that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled. The High Court also found that Nagaenthran had repeatedly changed \"his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed\". The High Court found that Nagaenthran showed that he was \"capable of manipulation and evasion\" during his offence, as Nagaenthran tried to dissuade Central Narcotics Bureau officers from searching him at the checkpoint by stating that he was \"working in security\", playing into the \"social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.\"In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal of Nagaenthran's case.

Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve's director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a \"disgraceful act\" which was \"ruthlessly carried out\" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice. Bailes also stated in his own words, \"Witnesses, juries and courts make mistakes, but the death penalty once carried out is irreversible.\" The case of Nagaenthran also brought to attention the past cases of Australians executed for drug offences in Southeast Asian countries (e.g. Barlow and Chambers execution in Malaysia, Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore, and both Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Bali Nine in Indonesia) and Australia's public opposition against the death penalty.The case of Nagaenthran's execution brought attention to the cases of the nine remaining Malaysians (including Datchinamurthy Kataiah and Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) on Singapore's death row, as well as four other Malaysians hanged for drug trafficking prior to Nagaenthran's execution. The risk of execution of these nine Malaysians despite being alleged couriers or allegedly disabled brought concern to the activists who opposed the death penalty. The United Nations also criticised Singapore for executing Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman and stated that Singapore should impose a moratorium as a first step to abolish the death penalty, and urged Singapore to not execute Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was the third drug trafficker facing imminent execution in Singapore. Government's response. On the same day Nagaenthran was executed, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) made an official statement, in which they strongly condemned the allegations and rumours spread in relation to Nagaenthran's case, especially those seeking to \"cast aspersions\" on the involvement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, in which these rumours falsely suggested any form of bias made by Menon in his judgement in Nagaenthran's appeal. The AGC commented that the lawsuit against Menon was the seventh legal application (not including appeals) made on behalf of Nagaenthran, and they described the lawsuit as \"the latest attempt to abuse the court's processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran.\"The AGC also mentioned that prior to the lawsuit, it was specifically mentioned to Nagaenthran's counsel about Chief Justice Menon's appointment as the Attorney General during the prosecution of Nagaenthran, and Nagaenthran himself, under his lawyer's advice, made no objections for Menon to preside the lawsuit. However, this information appeared to be \"deliberately\" withheld from Nagaenthran's mother when she brought forward the lawsuit, since Nagaenthran's mother had filed the application with the help of friends and activists, the organisations of legal papers clearly were not solely the work of Nagaenthran's mother, and both the signature and email address did not belong to Nagaenthran's mother. Therefore, for these above reasons, there was no basis at all in making the application. The AGC responded in the official statement that these allegations amounted to \"contempt of the court\", and reiterated that it \"takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice\".On 28 April 2022, the day after Nagaenthran's execution, both the AGC and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) made statements to defend Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran in light of the international condemnation of Singapore and the execution."}]}, "correct": false}

Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of \"harassing\" and \"intimidating\" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations. Nagaenthran's 36-year-old sister Sharmila said that the family was saddened and shocked at their loss, and they were dissatisfied with Nagaenthran's final sentence despite coming to terms with his death. The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran's sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran's remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh. Over 200 family members and friends were present at the funeral. Reportedly, Sharmila did not allow a single politician to attend the funeral, claiming they're coming only for publicity but did not offer assistance while Nagaenthran was on death row.In the year 2022 itself, a total of eleven executions, including Nagaenthran's, were officially carried out in Singapore, all for drug trafficking. Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve's director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death.

He called on to all lawyers in Singapore to not engage in such procedures, as regardless of the lawyers' duty to the client or other reasons, the courts cannot countenance such clear abuse of process as it breached the responsibility of legal officers to the court. Legal proceedings against Nagaenthran's former counsel. On 10 May 2022, it was reported that Violet Netto, the lawyer who represented Nagaenthran in his second-last appeal to the Court of Appeal, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer and solicitor without a valid practising certificate on at least three occasions, including Nagaenthran's case and the last-ditch appeals of another two death row inmates Pausi Jefridin and Roslan Bakar. It was decreed under the law that solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year they act in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and Netto's certificate was expired at the time she represented Nagaenthran. For this, she potentially faced the maximum sentence of six months' jail, a S$2,500 fine, or both if convicted of acting as a lawyer without a valid certificate.Not only that, M Ravi, the human rights lawyer who also represented Nagaenthran before Netto, was subjected to seven separate professional disciplinary inquiries which may result in him being fined, suspended or struck off the Bar as a lawyer, in addition to three contempt proceedings as well as a number of police investigations for the repeated abuse of court processes through Nagaenthran's case. Ravi was also given a travel ban which restricted him from going to Malaysia. Due to these above proceedings against Nagaenthran's former lawyers, the rights groups and Malaysian lawyers criticised Singapore for supposed harassment of lawyers and stated that Singapore should respect the criminals' rights to legal representation, since Nagaenthran's mother and another prisoner Datchinamurthy Kataiah find themselves, in two separate cases, without the representation of legal counsel to argue their cases.On 25 May 2022, the Court of Appeal released a court order, in which they ruled that Ravi and Netto should pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) as compensation to the unnecessary costs incurred by the lawsuits both lawyers made without solid evidence in Nagaenthran's case; Ravi was to bear 75% of the total cost while the remaining 25% would be covered by Netto. A small-scale public funding event was carried out to gather funds to help Ravi and Netto to discharge their fine; some activists criticised Singapore for punishing the two lawyers for merely fulfilling their duties for their former client. Also, Ravi, who also need to pay S$10,000 and S$12,000 for another two lawsuits separately, remained defiant and unapologetic, stating that he paid a heavy price in saving lives from capital punishment despite the government's condemnation of his errors. Police probe of activists. On 27 June 2022, it was reported that several people including activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated by police for illegally organising three public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit to show their opposition to the death penalty and support for drug traffickers Abdul Kahar Othman and Nagaenthran before their executions on 30 March 2022 and 27 April 2022 respectively. Han and Howe were also asked by police to submit their anti-death penalty slogan shirts, handphones and other possessions as evidence for upcoming police investigations. Passing of the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill. In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate's execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal. The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022. While this law was supported by most like Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, there were criticisms from Human Rights Watch that Singapore did so to cut off inmates' chances to oppose their execution and access to last chances of justice."}]}, "correct": false}

Final appeals and second death warrant. Last court hearing. On 24 January 2022, Netto sought an adjournment of the appeal, and it was granted by the courts. The appeal was eventually heard on 1 March 2022, in which Netto argued for Nagaenthran to be subjected to psychiatric assessment prior to his execution to assess whether he should be considered mentally fit to undergo his hanging. Netto also tried to admit the reports of two foreign psychologists as evidence to support Nagaenthran's case. However, the judges stated that the last-minute drip-feeding of evidence were tantamount to an abuse of the court process. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong described the appeal as a \"continuation of a very cynical attempt to abuse the process of the court\" and criticized Netto for seeking to suppress the prison's independent medical records. The judgement was reserved, and while awaiting the verdict, the rights groups continually sought clemency for Nagaenthran, who still remained at Changi Prison awaiting his fate.Four weeks later, on 29 March 2022, the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, and they issued harsh words of condemnation and criticism towards Netto and M. Ravi for abusing the court process. As he delivered the verdict on behalf of the judges, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon pointed out that the appeal was filed based on inadmissible evidence and Ravi's own \"self-serving\" speculation that Nagaenthran has a mental age below 18 years old; there was no evidence to show any deterioration of Nagaenthran's mental faculties during his 13-year stay on Changi Prison's death row. The Court, relying on the findings of the trial court, accepted that Nagaenthran possessed borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. The two foreign psychologists' evidence was rejected as they did not personally assess Nagaenthran.Chief Justice Menon further pointed out that the Attorney-General's Chambers had intended to enter psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021 as evidence in court, but Nagaenthran's lawyers objected on the grounds of medical confidentiality, preventing the reports from being used as evidence. Menon questioned how Nagaenthran could withhold evidence regarding his medical condition after \"having called his medical condition into question\". Menon inferred that Nagaenthran was \"seeking to prevent the court from accessing that evidence because he knows or believes it would undermine his case\".Menon reprimanded the lawyers for mounting a baseless legal challenge against Nagaenthran's death penalty, which he described as \"without merit\" and an attempt to escape from death and defer his imminent execution. He also reiterated that it was improper to engage in or encourage last-minute attempts to reopen any concluded appeals without a reasonable basis, and as long as the capital punishment was imposed legally in the specified circumstances, it is intolerable for a defence counsel to repeatedly launch hopeless appeals and bring the justice system into disrepute.Menon also stated in the appeal verdict: In our judgment, these proceedings constitute a blatant and egregious abuse of the court's processes. They have been conducted with the seeming aim of unjustifiably delaying the carrying into effect of the sentence imposed on the appellant. Having lost his final chance to have his death sentence commuted, 33-year-old Nagaenthran was set for imminent execution. Nagaenthran's family were reportedly devastated and shocked to hear the appeal's dismissal. Second clemency appeal and outcome. In the aftermath of the appeal's dismissal, many civil groups still tried to appeal to Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show him mercy. Maya Foa, director of UK-based anti-death penalty group Reprieve, made a statement to Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, \"We urge \u202fPresident Halimah Yacob to listen to the cries for mercy within Singapore and around the world, from the United Nations to global business leaders, and spare\u202fthe life of this vulnerable man.\" Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) also accused the government of Singapore for violating international law and they also claimed that by sentencing Nagaenthran to death, Singapore had failed to abide by the conditions of prohibiting the killing of intellectually disabled persons. Together with M Ravi, LFL asked the Malaysian government to bring forward Nagaenthran's case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Global Commission on Drug Policy, citing the case of Nagaenthran, stated that the death penalty was an inappropriate response to any offences, including drug-related crimes. A protest was also made on 3 April 2022 at Hong Lim Park against the government's use of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's failed appeal. Besides, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and other death penalty issues from Singapore, as well as advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in the ASEAN member nations.While some netizens felt that Nagaenthran should be spared from the gallows and the death penalty should be removed, others agreed with and supported the judges' standing that Nagaenthran clearly knew the magnitude and consequences of his crime and stated he should face execution for his crime. Earlier in the same month Nagaenthran lost his appeal, a 2021 survey result was publicly revealed and it showed that more than 80% of Singaporeans believed that the death penalty should remain in Singapore due to its deterrent effect and relevance in fighting crime.M Ravi told the reporters that due to the complete exhaustion of avenues of appeal on Malaysia's part, no more appeals would be lodged and the execution could take place in days, but he continued to express his support for Nagaenthran's life to be spared. The concern that Nagaenthran's execution would take place soon was further intensified when 68-year-old Changi Prison inmate Abdul Kahar bin Othman, a Singaporean drug convict, was confirmed to be executed at dawn on 30 March 2022, making Abdul Kahar the first person to be hanged in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.On 16 April 2022, rights advocate Kokila Annamalai revealed in a Malaysian newspaper that a second clemency appeal submitted by Nagaenthran's family and supporters was rejected by the President of Singapore on 31 March 2022. Having personally witnessed the tender, loving moments between Nagaenthran and his family members during their prison visits and court session, Annamalai shared her sadness towards Nagaenthran for his imminent fate and she stated that there should be more to be done regarding the issue of capital punishment in Singapore, and criticised Singapore for a lack of mercy on Nagaenthran. The Guardian and Malaysian newspapers also confirmed that Nagaenthran's death sentence was upheld by the dismissal of his second clemency plea, and Ravi criticised the decision to reject clemency on Nagaenthran. Second death warrant. On 20 April 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) informed Nagaenthran's mother that her son's execution was rescheduled to take place on 27 April 2022, and that extended daily visits would be facilitated for the family until the eve of his execution. This announcement led to requests for the Malaysian government to delay Nagaenthran's execution by taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Upon receiving her son's second death warrant, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam appeared on Facebook in a video clip, in which she made a public apology on behalf of her son, and she begged for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran's life.By then, Amnesty International also filed a petition to seek clemency on behalf of Nagaenthran, and the petition itself garnered more than 8,000 signatures. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub."}]}, "correct": false}

The appeal was eventually heard on 1 March 2022, in which Netto argued for Nagaenthran to be subjected to psychiatric assessment prior to his execution to assess whether he should be considered mentally fit to undergo his hanging. Netto also tried to admit the reports of two foreign psychologists as evidence to support Nagaenthran's case. However, the judges stated that the last-minute drip-feeding of evidence were tantamount to an abuse of the court process. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong described the appeal as a \"continuation of a very cynical attempt to abuse the process of the court\" and criticized Netto for seeking to suppress the prison's independent medical records. The judgement was reserved, and while awaiting the verdict, the rights groups continually sought clemency for Nagaenthran, who still remained at Changi Prison awaiting his fate.Four weeks later, on 29 March 2022, the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, and they issued harsh words of condemnation and criticism towards Netto and M. Ravi for abusing the court process. As he delivered the verdict on behalf of the judges, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon pointed out that the appeal was filed based on inadmissible evidence and Ravi's own \"self-serving\" speculation that Nagaenthran has a mental age below 18 years old; there was no evidence to show any deterioration of Nagaenthran's mental faculties during his 13-year stay on Changi Prison's death row. The Court, relying on the findings of the trial court, accepted that Nagaenthran possessed borderline intellectual functioning but not mild intellectual disability. The two foreign psychologists' evidence was rejected as they did not personally assess Nagaenthran.Chief Justice Menon further pointed out that the Attorney-General's Chambers had intended to enter psychiatric and medical reports from check-ups done on Nagaenthran in 2021 as evidence in court, but Nagaenthran's lawyers objected on the grounds of medical confidentiality, preventing the reports from being used as evidence. Menon questioned how Nagaenthran could withhold evidence regarding his medical condition after \"having called his medical condition into question\". Menon inferred that Nagaenthran was \"seeking to prevent the court from accessing that evidence because he knows or believes it would undermine his case\".Menon reprimanded the lawyers for mounting a baseless legal challenge against Nagaenthran's death penalty, which he described as \"without merit\" and an attempt to escape from death and defer his imminent execution. He also reiterated that it was improper to engage in or encourage last-minute attempts to reopen any concluded appeals without a reasonable basis, and as long as the capital punishment was imposed legally in the specified circumstances, it is intolerable for a defence counsel to repeatedly launch hopeless appeals and bring the justice system into disrepute.Menon also stated in the appeal verdict: In our judgment, these proceedings constitute a blatant and egregious abuse of the court's processes. They have been conducted with the seeming aim of unjustifiably delaying the carrying into effect of the sentence imposed on the appellant. Having lost his final chance to have his death sentence commuted, 33-year-old Nagaenthran was set for imminent execution. Nagaenthran's family were reportedly devastated and shocked to hear the appeal's dismissal. Second clemency appeal and outcome. In the aftermath of the appeal's dismissal, many civil groups still tried to appeal to Singapore to commute Nagaenthran's sentence and show him mercy. Maya Foa, director of UK-based anti-death penalty group Reprieve, made a statement to Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, \"We urge \u202fPresident Halimah Yacob to listen to the cries for mercy within Singapore and around the world, from the United Nations to global business leaders, and spare\u202fthe life of this vulnerable man.\" Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) also accused the government of Singapore for violating international law and they also claimed that by sentencing Nagaenthran to death, Singapore had failed to abide by the conditions of prohibiting the killing of intellectually disabled persons. Together with M Ravi, LFL asked the Malaysian government to bring forward Nagaenthran's case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Global Commission on Drug Policy, citing the case of Nagaenthran, stated that the death penalty was an inappropriate response to any offences, including drug-related crimes. A protest was also made on 3 April 2022 at Hong Lim Park against the government's use of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's failed appeal. Besides, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and other death penalty issues from Singapore, as well as advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in the ASEAN member nations.While some netizens felt that Nagaenthran should be spared from the gallows and the death penalty should be removed, others agreed with and supported the judges' standing that Nagaenthran clearly knew the magnitude and consequences of his crime and stated he should face execution for his crime. Earlier in the same month Nagaenthran lost his appeal, a 2021 survey result was publicly revealed and it showed that more than 80% of Singaporeans believed that the death penalty should remain in Singapore due to its deterrent effect and relevance in fighting crime.M Ravi told the reporters that due to the complete exhaustion of avenues of appeal on Malaysia's part, no more appeals would be lodged and the execution could take place in days, but he continued to express his support for Nagaenthran's life to be spared. The concern that Nagaenthran's execution would take place soon was further intensified when 68-year-old Changi Prison inmate Abdul Kahar bin Othman, a Singaporean drug convict, was confirmed to be executed at dawn on 30 March 2022, making Abdul Kahar the first person to be hanged in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.On 16 April 2022, rights advocate Kokila Annamalai revealed in a Malaysian newspaper that a second clemency appeal submitted by Nagaenthran's family and supporters was rejected by the President of Singapore on 31 March 2022. Having personally witnessed the tender, loving moments between Nagaenthran and his family members during their prison visits and court session, Annamalai shared her sadness towards Nagaenthran for his imminent fate and she stated that there should be more to be done regarding the issue of capital punishment in Singapore, and criticised Singapore for a lack of mercy on Nagaenthran. The Guardian and Malaysian newspapers also confirmed that Nagaenthran's death sentence was upheld by the dismissal of his second clemency plea, and Ravi criticised the decision to reject clemency on Nagaenthran. Second death warrant. On 20 April 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) informed Nagaenthran's mother that her son's execution was rescheduled to take place on 27 April 2022, and that extended daily visits would be facilitated for the family until the eve of his execution. This announcement led to requests for the Malaysian government to delay Nagaenthran's execution by taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Upon receiving her son's second death warrant, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam appeared on Facebook in a video clip, in which she made a public apology on behalf of her son, and she begged for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran's life.By then, Amnesty International also filed a petition to seek clemency on behalf of Nagaenthran, and the petition itself garnered more than 8,000 signatures. Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub."}]}, "correct": true}

Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. However, a psychiatric report concluded that Nagaenthran had neither of the above. He was also not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the CNB, since he did not substantively assist them in disrupting the drug trafficking activities. Despite this, on 24 February 2015, Nagaenthran brought forward the application and tried to ask for mercy based on the conditions of an intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which would have made him ineligible for the death penalty. High Court reviews. In 2017, the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's re-sentencing application. Four psychiatric and psychological experts, including one called by the defence, agreed that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled. The High Court also found that Nagaenthran had repeatedly changed \"his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed\". The High Court found that Nagaenthran showed that he was \"capable of manipulation and evasion\" during his offence, as Nagaenthran tried to dissuade Central Narcotics Bureau officers from searching him at the checkpoint by stating that he was \"working in security\", playing into the \"social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.\"In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal of Nagaenthran's case. Court of Appeal review. After the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's appeal for re-sentencing, Nagaenthran, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, filed two separate appeals to ask for the Court of Appeal to commute his sentence under the newly enacted death penalty laws, but the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on 27 May 2019. The Court of Appeal said that there were numerous inconsistencies in Nagaenthran's account of his crime, which made it hard to rely on his defence given that they affected his credibility. The five judges - Sundaresh Menon, Belinda Ang, Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, and Chao Hick Tin - held that Nagaenthran may have a low IQ, but his mental responsibility for his offence was not substantially impaired. He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently.. Besides, Nagaenthran had known that it was unlawful for him to import heroin, and hid the drugs to avoid detection. He was also prone to being manipulative and evasive, as shown from his initial attempts to avoid being searched before the narcotics officers arrested him in 2009. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was \"the working of a criminal mind\" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong. Hence, Nagaenthran lost his final bid to be re-sentenced. Clemency petition and first public attention. Nagaenthran later appealed to the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob for clemency, which would have commuted his sentence to life imprisonment if successful, but his plea was rejected on 1 June 2020, which finalized his death sentence. The last time clemency was granted in Singapore was in 1998, when 19-year-old Mathavakannan Kalimuthu was pardoned from execution despite being sentenced to hang for murdering a gangster in 1996. Mathavakannan was paroled and released in 2012 after serving 16 years of his life sentence due to good behaviour.During the time Nagaenthran was appealing for clemency, his case attracted international attention and many who opposed the death penalty asked Singapore to spare Nagaenthran's life; Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam (aged 57 in 2019) and family also joined in the efforts to plead for mercy. In a 2019 news report, Malaysian human rights lawyer N Surendran denounced Singapore for unfairly subjecting a mentally disabled man to a death sentence, and he, together with Nagaenthran's new lawyer M Ravi argued that there was no fair trial for Nagaenthran since his defence's psychiatric evidence was allegedly not fully considered compared to the reports of the prosecution's psychiatrists.Singapore's law minister K Shanmugam, in light of prior accusations that Singapore was unfairly mistreating Malaysian drug traffickers (due to the increasing number of Malaysians being executed for drug trafficking), argued that there is no inequality in treating foreigners and locals under the law for drug trafficking. He said the majority of Singaporeans favour the death penalty and it would be good for both sides if drug traffickers were caught by Malaysian authorities, as the offenders could be dealt with according to Malaysia's laws and not have to worry about Singapore's capital punishment."}]}, "correct": false}

In 1855, the livestock market was moved to a new location in Islington, known as the Metropolitan Cattle Market. The demand for meat increased due to a growing population and higher wages, but the British farming industry couldn't meet the demand, leading to the importation of foreign cattle duty-free. This practice, however, resulted in the introduction of diseases, such as rinderpest, which spread rapidly throughout Britain. In response to the cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7, new laws were enacted, including the establishment of a second metropolitan livestock market, the Foreign Cattle Market, for imported animals. Located in Deptford, this market was designed to handle up to three cattle boats at once and had enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep. The market opened in 1872 and by 1880, most imported animals were slaughtered at Deptford. The market operated through private bargains between salesmen and buyers, with buyers estimating the weight of the live animals. The market's volume of trade increased significantly, with 78% of London's live cattle trade going to Deptford by 1907. However, in the Edwardian era, a combination of Chicago meatpackers started bypassing the marketing system, leading to the slaughter of 16.5 million animals at Deptford. Cattle boats from the Continent brought over a thousand animals a year, with the market eventually purchasing three paddle steamers to convey the cattle from Gravesend to Deptford.", "text": "Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy\u2014a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide. At low tides the water depth was at least 12 feet (3.7 m), thought to be sufficient for most steamers. These piers still stand today, though they have been interconnected.. The architect was Sir Horace Jones, designer of Smithfield Market and Tower Bridge. Since time was short, Jones took a minimalist approach. The site was not cleared: the existing dockyard buildings were preserved and adapted as necessary. The dockyard had a tidal basin surrounded by three ship-building sheds, each as lofty as Charing Cross station (see title image). By connecting these together Jones obtained a cattle lairage building comprising a pentagonal horseshoe with open sides facing the river and the landing piers (see Layout).  To the east another lairage shed had its own pier.  Animals were provided with water troughs and hay racks, and the lairs were brilliantly lighted at night by gas lamps.  There was enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep.  Later it was enlarged, and could accommodate 8,500 cattle and 20,000 sheep.  Admiralty storehouses were converted into abattoirs, comprising some 70 slaughterhouses.The demise of the old naval dockyard was regretted by many, and some features dating to Henry VIII were preserved.  By order of the City officials, a board was put up bearing the following inscription: \"Here worked as a ship-carpenter Peter, Czar of all the Russias, afterwards Peter the Great, 1698.\" \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t. \t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t. The market was opened for business in January 1872. In 1871 nearly half of cattle and sheep imported into the UK had been sold live at Islington, but by 1880 most were slaughtered at Deptford. Market life. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall.  Services inside included bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and the market's own pub, the Peter the Great. Trading. It was not an auction market.  Trading was by private bargain, and in live animals only.  Exporters consigned cattle, sheep and pigs to salesmen who worked on commission.  Salesmen and buyers intermingled around the animal pens. Market days were Mondays and Thursdays, but there was nothing to stop animals being sold in their lairs on other days, and this was often done, especially when a shipload arrived late.. Weighbridges were seldom used: it was a matter of professional pride that cattle weights were guesstimated.  A journalist described it for Australian readers:The buyer runs over the lot, say, twenty or fifty, averaging the weights by calculation, and then offers a price, which is of course contemptuously rejected at first. By a gradual process of approximation the difficulty is got over, and a shake of the hand, or other mysterious sign, indicates the purchase of \u00a31000 worth of beef. The buyers were wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers, who had access to slaughterhouse space on the premises, generally renting it by the year. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law; the buyers took away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces: most of the meat they resold at Smithfield.  By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).  Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations \u2014 that animals need not be put up for sale on market days \u2014 to bypass the marketing system altogether.  See The Beef Trust, below.. Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford. Cattle boats. Cattle boats from the Continent \u2014 over a thousand a year \u2014 came up the Thames on Sundays and Wednesdays.As the transatlantic cattle trade developed (see below), large ocean-going cattle steamers came into use, but these were reluctant to come alongside.  Accordingly the market purchased three paddle steamers (named Racoon, Taurus and Claude Hamilton) into which cattle were transshipped at Gravesend.  Between them, those vessels conveyed more than 1.6 million animals to Deptford."}]}, "correct": false}

An alternative, cheaper option was American chilled meat, which required prompt sale upon arrival and cold-storage extension of its shelf life. This chilled trade was larger than the live animal trade and led to cheaper bread in England due to the need for ballast on ships carrying livestock.\n\nMultiple sources discuss the development and challenges of the transatlantic cattle trade. \"The Exportation of Cattle\" (1880) and \"The Transatlantic Cattle Trade\" (1891) describe the early stages of the trade and its growth.

The market's demand for high-quality livestock led to improvements in American cattle, particularly through the importation of prize British bulls and the upgrading of range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood. This, in turn, led to better beef and improved the quality of American cattle. Similarly, Canadian and Argentine cattle exports to Deptford also increased, with the latter undergoing significant improvements due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. However, the trade faced challenges such as the Beef Trust's control over the meat market and animal welfare concerns during long journeys. By 1900, the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America, and by 1909, it was reported that the Trust controlled the North Atlantic meat trade, but its power to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and large shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina. Animal welfare remained a concern, with transport-related stress and injury being major sources of loss to the meat industry.", "text": "Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.  \"On the western plains the ranches that succeeded the open range bought high priced sires with which to upgrade their old stock. The upturn in the quality of beef animals, with younger cattle going to the feedlot, meant better beef from the slaughter house and on the family table, all part of a general improvement\". It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.  By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. Distances. Already in 1880 The Times was advising its readers that a 1,200 pounds (540 kg) steer from (say) Colorado, Wyoming or Montana could be conveyed to Deptford market \u2014 over 2,000 miles of land and 3,000 of ocean \u2014 for \u00a310 or \u00a312. It included cowboys' wages, rail fare, shipping freight and the landing charges at Deptford (which, thought the author, were rather extortionate).  All this added only 4d a pound to the carcase price of beef (\u2245\u00a34.40 a kilo2018).Scientific American reported that, recently, five cattle-laden steamers had sailed from New York to England in one day.  The cattle in this new trade \"come principally from Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado\".. Some cattle came to Deptford from as far away as Oregon, though this was sporadic.  The English adventurer Moreton Frewen, writing to The Times, saidCroma, due at Deptford Saturday, the 25th, has on board a hundred fat bullocks, the first consignment of western American cattle that have as yet taken advantage of the cheap transportation afforded by the Great Lakes. The majority of them were bred by myself and brother in Wyoming in 1881, but some few which can be distinguished by their brand ... are from far distant Oregon, and, having walked through from there to Wyoming in 1882, were purchased by me at the end of their long march.  It is [remarkable] that beasts calved more than 6,000 miles away on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, matured in Wyoming and fattened on Lake Superior, should have been destined after crossing the Atlantic on the hoof, to \"terminate their engagements\" in the Thames. Significance to the West. The exportation of cattle to England had a discernible impact on the American livestock industry.  While not all American exports went to Deptford, London was the most important market.  Wrote John P. Huttman:The impact of foreign demand for U.S. meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds\". As noted, the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.. Further, some British agriculturalists, shielded until recently from American competition \u2014 first by distance, then by quality issues \u2014 found it attractive to go in for American ranching themselves. They \"fought competition at its source and engaged directly in American ranching, until by 1884 it was estimated that 'one-sixth of all our herds are now owned by Englishmen'\".  And British investors, attracted by the fabulous profits sometimes realised in the West, made an important contribution to its development. From Canada. A major export industry at the time, range cattle came from Alberta and Assiniboia and went east on the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The St. Lawrence River route meant that cattle started the voyage in calm waters and comparatively cool weather. \"Most of the losses of cattle in shipments from Atlantic ports were due to delay and neglect prior to shipping and occurred during the first few days of the crossing\".  For many years Canadian livestock was considered disease-free and could be landed freely, but it was scheduled for slaughter at Deptford from 1892 on.  It did western ranchers little harm:The movement of high quality to the British market continued unabated. These great range-bred cattle had to be slaughtered within the port holding pens anyway, because they were too wild to ship conveniently to provincial butchers.Exports to England rose from 115,000 cattle in 1900 to 160,000 in 1905, but petered out after a severe winter depleted half the range-cattle industry's working capital. From Argentina. As the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford's main supply of animals came from Argentina.  Formerly, Argentine cattle \"were of an inferior breed, their chief characteristics being thick hides and well-developed horns\"; they were slaughtered locally for their hides, bones and tallow. Two things transformed the Argentine beef industry into the greatest exporter in the world: selective breeding and alfalfa (lucerne) forage.From about 1888 live cattle and sheep were shipped as deck cargo from Buenos Aires, carpenters knocking up temporary stalls and pens.  Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.  Progressive Argentine cattlemen were keenly aware that quality was important, and they paid large prices for Shorthorn bulls to improve their herds.   Such was the demand for export-grade cattle in 1903 that an American agent told his government \"it is extremely difficult to get a good piece of beef in the city of Buenos Aires\".  \"Wild, untamed brutes\" did badly on the sea journey, and had to be tamed in advance and taught to eat hay.Deptford was closed to Argentine cattle and sheep in 1900 for foot-and-mouth, and briefly re-opened in 1903.  Thereafter there was scant incentive to revive the live meat trade on these very long journeys.  From about 1900 good chilled Argentine beef was a more satisfactory alternative. Severe unemployment came to Deptford. From Australia and New Zealand. At the end of the Victorian era cattle and sheep were shipped to Deptford Market from as far away as Victoria (Australia), New South Wales, Queensland, and Dunedin, New Zealand.. The first commercial (though experimental) shipment was from Sydney on the steamer Maori King, a 67-day voyage which went around Cape Horn in winter \u2014 presumably to avoid the heat of the Suez Canal.  The cattle landed at Deptford in September 1894, but sold at a heavy loss.  Next year there was a much more successful voyage by Port Pirie: one animal died of heat in the Red Sea, but the others arrived in excellent condition (see illustration).  Another success was 250 sheep per Banffshire from Dunedin; only one was lost.. However, as shipments continued there were \"terrible\" losses.  For these ambitious voyages more than halfway round the world, excellent planning and execution were essential, but were wanting. The Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, clapped an extinguisher on the trade. The vessel left the port on November 22, 1895, and arrived at Deptford on February 9, 1896, with 32 animals [alive], some of which were in a maimed condition. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took the matter up, and the Board of Agriculture inspected the ship and issued an order prohibiting the Angers from carrying live stock from or to any port in Great Britain for a twelvemonth.. Altogether in the Australasian live trade, 607 cattle were lost out of 2,654 shipped, and 57 out of 3,882 sheep. The Beef Trust. The Beef Trust was a cartel of the large Chicago meat packers.  Acting in collusion they allocated market shares and fixed meat prices in the United States, eventually coming under attack by \"trust buster\" president Theodore Roosevelt.  As described in the next section, by 1900 the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America.. In the Edwardian era reputable newspapers claimed that  the Trust had bought up many shops in Smithfield Market;. they met every morning to fix the price of British beef;. they practically controlled the lairages at Deptford Market; but. instead of selling their Deptford cattle to buyers at that market, they sent the meat directly to Smithfield; with the result that, on a numerous occasions, market days at Deptford were cancelled for lack of support.As a result of persistent questioning by C. W. Bowerman, Labour MP for Deptford, Winston Churchill (the President of the Board of Trade) set up an inquiry into \"how far and in what manner the general supply, distribution and price of Meat in the United Kingdom are controlled or affected by any combination of firms or companies\".  The inquiry reported in 1909.  The allegations were generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom.  This was because, although it did indeed control the North Atlantic meat trade, American beef exports had declined, and large shipments of refrigerated beef were coming from Argentina. Animal welfare: journeys. Animals were sent from the grasslands of the world to be slaughtered at Deptford market.  Even today, when animal welfare is a consideration and the average journey from feedlot to slaughter plant lasts just a few hours, transport-related stress and injury are major sources of loss to the American meat industry."}]}, "correct": false}

The transatlantic cattle trade developed, with livestock being shipped to England, facing issues such as disease, poor transportation conditions, and fraudulent labeling of meat origin. An alternative, cheaper option was American chilled meat, which required prompt sale upon arrival and cold-storage extension of its shelf life. This chilled trade was larger than the live animal trade and led to cheaper bread in England due to the need for ballast on ships carrying livestock.\n\nMultiple sources discuss the development and challenges of the transatlantic cattle trade. \"The Exportation of Cattle\" (1880) and \"The Transatlantic Cattle Trade\" (1891) describe the early stages of the trade and its growth.

The market's demand for high-quality livestock led to improvements in American cattle, particularly through the importation of prize British bulls and the upgrading of range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood. This, in turn, led to better beef and improved the quality of American cattle. Similarly, Canadian and Argentine cattle exports to Deptford also increased, with the latter undergoing significant improvements due to selective breeding and alfalfa forage. However, the trade faced challenges such as the Beef Trust's control over the meat market and animal welfare concerns during long journeys. By 1900, the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America, and by 1909, it was reported that the Trust controlled the North Atlantic meat trade, but its power to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom was limited due to declining American beef exports and large shipments of refrigerated beef from Argentina.

It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.  By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. Distances. Already in 1880 The Times was advising its readers that a 1,200 pounds (540 kg) steer from (say) Colorado, Wyoming or Montana could be conveyed to Deptford market \u2014 over 2,000 miles of land and 3,000 of ocean \u2014 for \u00a310 or \u00a312. It included cowboys' wages, rail fare, shipping freight and the landing charges at Deptford (which, thought the author, were rather extortionate).  All this added only 4d a pound to the carcase price of beef (\u2245\u00a34.40 a kilo2018).Scientific American reported that, recently, five cattle-laden steamers had sailed from New York to England in one day.

They established a liner system for shipping livestock to England, as the long journeys by train or ship caused significant stress and injury to the animals. This liner system helped ensure regular and timely shipments of livestock in excellent condition. Despite regulations, the conditions for transporting livestock were often poor, and animals were subjected to cruel methods to make them stand up. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat, which was already being imported into London in 1875 and was much cheaper to send across the Atlantic than on the hoof. However, the chilled meat trade was considered riskier as the meat had to be sold promptly upon arrival at the London docks, whereas the live beasts could be sold at a later time. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders and that chilled meat was as good as, if not better than, Deptford-killed beef.", "text": "They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile.  It was to the business advantage of shippers (hence, liners) that livestock arrive in the Thames on time and in excellent condition.  By 1892 North Atlantic animal losses were reduced to less than 1%, ten times better than on the Buenos Aires run.. Even in the good liners, however, the dung and urine were left to accumulate in the holds; the ammoniacal stench was said to be unbearable.  According to Scientific AmericanCattle on deck often have the seawater which comes on board frozen on their backs, and heavy rolls and pitches cause many broken legs. The average run from New York to the Thames was 11 days.  Cattle could scent land, sometimes setting up \"a united bellow\"  when thirty or forty hours from shore. Cattle trains. From the livestock-raising regions animals were taken to market by train, mostly to Chicago. onto which 17 railroads converged.  At the Chicago stockyards there was a special market for \"export grade\" cattle; these were railed to ports on the eastern seaboard for shipment to England.  The map also shows the Canadian Pacific Railway that took livestock from the foothills of the Rocky mountains to Montreal. Lengthy journeys. Animals were not supposed to travel more than 28 hours at a time, according to a U.S. federal law of 1873, after which they must be got off the train for water, food and 5 hours rest.  Quite often at these stops, however, the railroad companies, who were not very enthusiastic about the cattle trade, neglected to provide proper water or food, or there was nowhere to rest because the station stockyard was a sea of mud or a drift of snow.The 28-hour limit was widely ignored, and there was even something to be said for that, because repeatedly unloading and reloading the animals could do them more harm than leaving them on the train.  Thus in 1906 the law was amended to allow animals to be carried for up to 36 hours at a time if the owners agreed, and from now on the law was enforced'Palace' or \"parlor\" stock cars were special vehicles supposed to furnish water and hay for animals to consume en route, and hence exempted from the 28-hour law.  Thus they could and did run for 60 or even 100 hours at a time.  It seems that in reality, however, water and food were seldom supplied to these vehicles: some thought they were a sham. Overcrowding and injury. Shipping space was usually sold by the carload, so there was an incentive to cram in as many animals as possible to save freight charges, which were high.  Some held that tight packing was good for the animals because it stopped them fighting or lying down, or falling over when the engine jerked the train or when it went round a tight curve. If a steer did fall, or lay down to rest, there was a risk that it might never get up again.  Consequently cattle attendants, who travelled in the caboose, went round at intervals and, if they spotted a recumbent animal, tried to make it stand up.  For this purpose there was a special tool called a cattle prod which, if the steer was not actually dying, usually worked.  A stockman recalled: The toughest job I ever undertook was to start from the Missouri River and land a consignment of cattle in the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, without a loss. The first run was three hundred miles across the State of Iowa to the Mississippi River; it generally took thirty-six hours, two nights and a day. In loading cattle, on account of the freight charges, you naturally would get every steer in a car you could. The steers had \"standing room only\"; consequently, if a steer got down, which was a very common occurrence, on account of the fatigue from standing too long, it was either to get that steer on his feet again or he would be trampled to death, and away would go the profit on that car of cattle.. He described how:Sometimes you could raise him by standing alongside of the car and using your prod \u2014 a pole about six feet long with a sharp iron point in one end of it \u2014 but often you had to climb into the end window of the car and go right among them, horns, droppings, and all, and take your chances of ever getting out alive, the trainmen paying no attention to you, the train running thirty miles an hour, and maybe it is night and as dark as pitch. . A government official wrote: \"Under the present system not a train is brought to any great market without having many crippled beeves, and several dead ones\". In Canada. There was no 28-hour law in Canada and rail journeys were immense. The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was \"sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer\", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain \"gaunt and shrunken\". Whether economic justification for live cattle trade. Plimsoll's case. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders.  He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not \u2014 namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently \u2014 as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it. A writer to The Times said:I know a family in this town of good position who after much anxious thought and weighing all the chances of being poisoned, &c, timorously resolved one day to try this American beef. Unfortunately, the servants heard of the great experiment. The joint, a fine one, was duly served; the family ate and liked it... But, would you believe it, Sir, not one of the four servants would touch it!  By the Edwardian era two authors said \"the West-End folk are very large customers for chilled beef of the highest quality\", which suggests it could be quite palatable.  However that may be, Plimsoll argued it was up to the customer to decide.  She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier.

Butchers argued that the farmers were protecting themselves against competition, while Plimsoll claimed that chilled meat was as good as, if not better than, Deptford-killed beef.

He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or \u00a34 per head of cattle (\u225d \u00a35002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market's trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that \"foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton\".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

Those who boycotted the event did so because they saw it as inconsistent with Youngkin's policy stances, which they considered to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. That same month, Youngkin hosted the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ+ Republican group, at the Governor's Mansion. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which wrote that Youngkin's choice to celebrate Pride Month \"dismays many people of faith\".In July 2022, shortly after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if that court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can't live in the world of hypotheticals.\" The Virginia Constitution includes an amendment banning same-sex marriage, which, according to Washington Post, \"would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself.\" An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office. Marijuana. A few months after his inauguration, Youngkin proposed that Virginia recriminalize possessing more than two ounces of marijuana. When the Northam administration, a year earlier, had legalized possessing up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia, it did so while establishing a system in which possessing between one ounce and one pound was made punishable by a $25 fine; possessing over one pound remained a felony. This system made Virginia the only US state to have legalized marijuana possession without having misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount. Youngkin's proposal to introduce such penalties in Virginia was inspired by a recommendation made in 2021 by the state legislature's nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.Under Youngkin's proposal, possessing more than two ounces of marijuana would become a Class 2 misdemeanor, while possessing more than six ounces would become a Class 1 misdemeanor. Before this proposal was made, the Democratic-controlled State Senate had passed a bill during the 2022 legislative session that would have made possessing more than four ounces of marijuana a Class 3 misdemeanor. That bill, which also would have legalized the sale of recreational marijuana in Virginia, was rejected by the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. Later that year, as part of a bipartisan budget deal signed by Youngkin, Virginia made possessing between four ounces and a pound of marijuana in public a Class 3 misdemeanor for a first time offense and a Class 2 misdemeanor for repeat offenses. This same budget deal banned the sale of cannabis products shaped as animals, humans, vehicles, or fruits, so as to protect against accidental consumption by children.Separate marijuana legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 allows patients to purchase medical marijuana immediately upon receiving a certificate to do so from a registered medical provider. Previously, patients were required to register with the State Board of Pharmacy before they could make such a purchase. This reform was enacted due to long wait times occurring during the registration process.Youngkin has also proposed raising the legal age for purchasing CBD products in Virginia to 21 and banning products that contain Delta-8 THC, which is described by The Washington Post as \"a hemp-derived compound that has become popular for its similarity to Delta-9, the main compound in marijuana that gives consumers a high. Voting rights. As governor, Youngkin has continued the work of restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell's immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam. Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences. An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam's final year in office, but amendments  to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum, and Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin's first year in office.In 2022, Youngkin signed bipartisan legislation requiring that the removal of deceased voters from Virginia's electoral rolls be conducted on a weekly basis; this had previously been done on a monthly basis. That same year, Youngkin signed legislation changing how absentee ballots are reported in Virginia. Previously, these ballots had been reported as part of a single, at-large precinct. Youngkin's legislation requires that they instead be reported precinct-by-precinct. Involvement in the 2022 federal midterms. During the 2022 federal elections, Youngkin campaigned frequently for Republicans in other states, supporting both candidates who had embraced Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election and those who had not. This led to The Washington Post writing that Youngkin had \"demonstrated uncommon flexibility on an issue that for others...represents a bright line.\" Youngkin's refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his own party has elicited criticism from some moderate Republicans, such as Liz Cheney, David Jolly, and Bill Kristol.Among the candidates Youngkin campaigned for during the midterms was former Maine governor Paul LePage, who was seeking a nonconsecutive third term in office. During his previous tenure as governor, LePage had drawn controversy for a series of comments that both Republican and Democratic politicians condemned as racist; these comments included LePage stating that \"the enemy right now...are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.\" Youngkin initially claimed to be unaware of these comments. He later condemned the comments but defended his choice to campaign for LePage, claiming that LePage had apologized. As reported by The Washington Post, LePage had not actually apologized for most of the comments.Hours after it was reported that Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, was the victim of a politically motivated assault that left him with a fractured skull, Youngkin appeared at a campaign appearance in support of a Republican congressional candidate running in the 2022 federal midterms, where he stated, \"Speaker Pelosi\u2019s husband \u2013 they had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There\u2019s no room for violence anywhere, but we\u2019re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna go do.\" Virginia Democrats condemned Youngkin for choosing to speak against the Pelosis so soon after the attack. When asked if he wanted to apologize for the comment, Youngkin chose not to do so but stated, \"a terrible thing happened to the speaker\u2019s husband and it should never have happened and we wish him a speedy recovery. The first lady and I keep him in our prayers.\" Time magazine wrote that Youngkin and other Republicans who used the assault to engage in criticism of the Pelosis had \"highlighted the devolved state of American political discourse\", while Don Scott, the Democratic leader in Virginia's House of Delegates, stated that Youngkin's response to the assault was part of a long trend in which he felt that \"Youngkin's espoused Christian values didn't match his actions\". A few days after his initial comment, Youngkin stated that he \"didn't do a great job\" of condemning the attack and apologized for his rhetoric in a handwritten letter to Nancy Pelosi.

Describing it as a \"snitch line\", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would \"backfire\" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by \"Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic\", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.On February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was \"responding\" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia's FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin's office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had \"quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up\". The second lawsuit is still ongoing. Loudoun County School Board proposal. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members. A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at \"holding [the board] to account\" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier. Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign. In response to Youngkin's proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office. The Washington Post reported that Youngkin's effort had \"stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.\" The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the \"more controversial actions\" that Youngkin had taken and led to \"one of the harshest partisan eruptions\" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin's term. Legal scholar A.E. Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia's Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s. The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Repeal of protections for transgender students. In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools. These protections had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. That bill requires that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with \"model policies\" developed by the Virginia Department of Education. Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes. The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student. Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin's policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students. It has been suggested that Youngkin's policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot \"encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student\u2019s parent, including information related to gender.\"The Youngkin administration framed its replacement of the Northam administration's policies as part of a \"commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students.\" The Washington Post noted that Youngkin's actions fit into a national trend among Republicans, writing that \"at least 300 pieces of legislation\" curtailing the rights of transgender Americans had been introduced throughout the country in 2022, mostly focusing on children. Despite the legal requirement that they do so, most Virginia school districts had failed to adopt the Northam administration's model policies by the time that the Youngkin administration's replacement policies were announced. Other school districts have refused to adopt the Youngkin administration's model policies, expressing the view that these policies are in violation of state law.Youngkin's actions are expected to face court challenges. Although the 2020 bill signed by Northam did not specify what Virginia's model policies for the treatment of transgender students should be, it stated that the policies should \"address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices\" and that the policies should protect transgender students from bullying and harassment. Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet this criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law. It has been reported that Youngkin's model policies may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act, which bans schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, and that Youngkin's policy mandating that students use restrooms corresponding with their biological sex may be unenforceable due to the 2020 court ruling in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, which mandates that students in Virginia be allowed to use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity.Shortly after the Youngkin administration's policies were announced, several thousand students from over ninety Virginia schools protested the policies by engaging in walkouts. Organizers of the walkouts stated that the Youngkin administration's policies \"will only hurt students in a time when students are facing unparalleled mental health challenges, and are a cruel attempt to politicize the existence of LGBTQIA+ students for political gain.\" Education budget. Youngkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average. Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennual education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually. The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state's achievement gaps.In contrast to McAuliffe, who introduced much of his education platform concurrently with his announcement to run in the Democratic primary, Youngkin did not begin sharing proposals for state spending on education until months after securing the Republican nomination. McAuliffe criticized Youngkin for not releasing budget details until late in the campaign and argued that spending on education in Virginia could be threatened by the extent of Youngkin's tax cut proposals. The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin's education platform was \"far lighter on details\" than McAuliffe's and that it largely focused on cultural issues over budgetary proposals. Youngkin began offering specific proposals for education spending late in the summer of 2021, only a few months before the election. These proposals included $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.Youngkin inherited a record surplus in state revenue from Northam, which was projected to continue growing during the state's then-upcoming budget cycle. As a result of this surplus, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a biennial state budget in 2022 that committed $19.2 billion to education, a record for the state even when accounting for inflation. This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats."}]}, "correct": true}

This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats. In exchange for getting much of their desired education spending enacted, Democrats agreed to enact several of Youngkin's tax cut proposals.Incorporated into the budget compromise was an outgoing proposal of Northam's to enact a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers. This plan was chosen over the one preferred by Republicans, which would have paired a more modest 8% salary increase for teachers over two years with 1% bonuses.School construction and maintenance received $1.25 billion in the 2022 biennial state budget. This exceeds the amount that had been allotted for these needs in Northam's outgoing budget proposals but is a small fraction of the $25 billion that the Virginia Department of Education says it would take to fully replace the state's oldest schools.The Virginia Preschool Initiative was expanded by the 2022 biennial state budget. This program provides preschool for many low-income children in the state. Prior to 2022, the program only served children aged four or older, and only families earning less than the federal poverty line could qualify. The 2022 state budget that Youngkin signed lowered the age eligibility to include three year olds and raised the income threshold to 300% of the federal poverty line. Teacher shortages. In September 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order directing education officials in his administration to combat Virginia's teacher shortages by easing the process of gaining a teaching license in the state. The order aims to fill vacancies by focusing in large part on recruiting retired teachers, people whose teaching licenses have expired, people with out-of-state teaching licenses, college students in teacher training programs, and military veterans seeking to transition into teaching careers. The order also provides additional funding to school districts with the most severe teacher shortages in Virginia and seeks to bolster in-school child care options for teachers.The Washington Post reported that \"Youngkin\u2019s actions to loosen standards regarding who can become a teacher mirror efforts in other states, including Florida and Arizona, as the nation faces a catastrophic teacher shortage.\" According to the same publication, some educator groups in Virginia have criticized aspects of Youngkin's executive order, arguing that it could \"allow unqualified individuals to teach children\", while education policy experts have argued that teacher shortages have been exacerbated in Virginia by education-related culture war issues that Youngkin has escalated during his governorship. Charter schools and lab schools. While running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term. After the election, The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that Youngkin's actual goal for charter schools would be to increase the number in Virginia \"to match North Carolina, which has more than 200.\" Only seven charter schools currently exist in Virginia, one of the lowest amounts in the country, and Youngkin has backed proposed legislation that would shift the authority to approve new charter schools from local school boards to newly created \"regional charter school divisions\". These divisions would have nine voting members, eight appointed by the Virginia State Board of Education, and one appointed by local school boards within the region.The state budget that Youngkin signed for 2022 includes $100 million for re-establishing lab schools in Virginia. These K-12 public schools, which are separate from charter schools, had previously existed in the state and had continued to be allowed under Virginia law before Youngkin came into office, but none remained operating in the state by the start of Youngkin's term. Previous lab schools in Virginia had been established as partnerships with institutions of higher learning; only public colleges and universities with teacher training programs were allowed to enter into these partnerships. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget removed the requirement that all lab schools in the state act as teacher training programs. It also opened lab school partnerships to be formed with community colleges or certain private universities. Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears had to break a tie vote in the State Senate for this budget amendment to be approved by the General Assembly. Youngkin has additionally advocated for allowing private businesses to enter into lab school partnerships. He has said that lab schools could be either newly established or converted out of existing schools and has supported legislation that would direct the Virginia State Board of Education to \"give substantial preference\" to lab school applications filed by historically black colleges or universities. Under that legislation, the same preference would be given to applications seeking to establish lab schools in \"underserved communities\".Youngkin supports revising how Virginia public schools are funded, so that per pupil funding for any students attending lab schools in the state would go to the institutions operating the schools attended by those students instead of going to the public school boards for the districts where those students reside. An amendment proposed by Youngkin for the 2022 state budget would have enacted this plan but was not adopted by the General Assembly. Although the Virginia Education Association and the Editorial Board of The Free Lance\u2013Star have both supported Youngkin's goal of re-establishing lab schools in Virginia, they have also both criticized Youngkin's plan for redirecting per pupil funding away from local school boards, noting that because Virginia law allows lab schools to enroll students from anywhere in the state, the plan could lead to decreased funding for certain school districts. College athletics. In 2022, Youngkin signed legislation allowing college athletes in Virginia to profit through name, image, and likeness deals. This permanently codified a policy that had already been enacted on a temporary basis a year earlier when Northam was in office. The policy had been temporary under Northam because it had been enacted through the state budget. As had been the case when enacted by Northam, the policy as enacted by Youngkin does not allow college athletes to sponsor or endorse alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, drugs, weapons, casinos, or adult entertainment. The policy allows student athletes to hire agents and ensures that scholarships cannot be lost as a result of earning compensation through a name, image, and likeness deal. School safety. In April 2022, Youngkin signed House Bill 741 into law mandating all public schools in Virginia to create detailed digital floor plans of their buildings. The law also provides $6.5 million to schools to create these floor plans.In May 2022, Youngkin signed a bipartisan bill requiring that principals report to law enforcement certain misdemeanor crimes committed by students on school grounds. This restores a law that had existed before the Northam administration. In 2020, Northam had signed a bill giving principals discretion over whether to report misdemeanor crimes to law enforcement. Northam's policy, which had still required the reporting of felonies, had been adopted in an effort to combat the school-to-prison pipeline. Data from before Northam's policy had been adopted showed that more students in Virginia were reported to law enforcement than in any other state.In June 2022, shortly after the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Youngkin stressed his support for placing school resource officers in every school in Virginia.Another bill signed by Youngkin in 2022 requires that all members of student organizations at colleges or universities in Virginia receive training to prevent hazing. The bill, which was adopted with near unanimous support in the state legislature, also requires chapter advisors to undergo such training, requires that all hazing violations be publicly disclosed, and provides immunity to bystanders who report hazing violations. Environment. Asked if he accepts the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change, Youngkin said he does not know what causes climate change and that he considers the cause to be irrelevant. He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls. While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices."}]}, "correct": true}

He has also been active in addressing cultural issues, such as opposing the teaching of critical race theory and protections for transgender students.

Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order \"targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students.\"This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as \"a dumbing down of standards\". Youngkin called the program a \"left-wing takeover of public education\", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes \u2013 a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign. James Lane, Virginia Superintendent at the time, and NPR, both disputed this characterization of the program. The Virginia Math Pathways Initiative would have prioritized data science and data analytics over calculus while still offering students the opportunity to enroll in calculus at an accelerated pace. Although education officials within the Northam administration explored the potential benefits of detracking students prior to the 11th grade, no plans to do so were ever adopted, and in April 2021, those officials explained that the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative was not designed to eliminate advanced math classes at any grade level. Shortly after Youngkin and other conservatives first began speaking out against the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative, The Washington Post reported that the actual nature of the program had been \"obscured...[by] prominent Virginians and copious coverage from right-wing news outlets\" as \"outrage built online\" among those opposed to it.In early April 2022, Youngkin signed a bill allowing school parents throughout Virginia to review and opt their children out of any educational material containing \"sexually explicit content\"; any opted out student would be provided with alternative material. This is the first statewide law in the nation allowing for parental review of sexually explicit content in school curriculum. Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\". The bill passed along mostly party lines. A similar bill, known as the \"Beloved Bill\", was vetoed by McAuliffe in both 2016 and 2017. That bill, which had originated when a conservative activist took issue with the inclusion of Beloved in her high school senior son's AP English class, became one of the focal points of Virginia's 2021 gubernatorial election, and reviving the bill was identified by The Washington Post as \"one of the key promises\" of Youngkin's campaign. The provisions of the bill will take effect in 2023.In May 2022, Youngkin sent a letter to the Council of Presidents overseeing Virginia colleges and universities, urging mandatory political diversity in their hiring practices. That year, he introduced a budget amendment, which succeeded in the General Assembly, requiring that the state's public colleges and universities promote \"free speech and diversity of thought on [their] campuses.\"In August 2022, Youngkin enlisted the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, to assist in revising Virginia's educational standards for history and social sciences.During the 2022 legislative session, Youngkin advocated for a bill that would have reversed reforms that had been recently adopted to the admissions processes at some Governor's Schools in Virginia, specifically at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria and at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. Although race blind, the reformed admissions processes achieved their goal by implementing an approach largely based on geographic and socioeconomic factors. The bill supported by Youngkin would have banned such an approach, characterizing the use of geographic and socioeconomic factors as \"proxy discrimination\". This bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but failed in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. A separate bill signed by Youngkin that same year bans Governor's Schools in Virginia \"from discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the process of admitting students to such school.\" This bill, which received bipartisan support, was described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as \"a watered-down version\" of Youngkin's preferred bill. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin \"has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law.\" Tipline for \"divisive practices\". During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\" Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\".The tipline was described by The Washington Post as \"part of a broader push by Youngkin to identify and root out what he says are elements of critical race theory in the state\u2019s curriculum.\" The publication further reported that the tipline was viewed by \"a teachers union, Democrats in the General Assembly, some parents and other observers...as divisive, authoritarian and unfairly targeting educators.\" Virginia Republicans have defended the tipline by comparing it to systems that previous governors of the state had set up for people to report violations of business regulations and health protocols. On January 26, a spokesperson for Youngkin tweeted that critics of the tipline had mischaracterized it and described the tipline as \"a customary constituent service.\"A week after the tipline debuted, CNN reported that the initiative had drawn national attention. Colin Jost derided the tipline on Saturday Night Live during Weekend Update, and John Legend encouraged opponents of the initiative to co-opt the tipline, tweeting, \"Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced. We are parents too.\" Several media outlets reported that critics of Youngkin were spamming the tipline. Describing it as a \"snitch line\", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would \"backfire\" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by \"Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic\", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.On February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was \"responding\" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia's FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin's office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails."}]}, "correct": false}

While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices. Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas. He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade.After winning the election, Youngkin said that he would use an executive action to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap-and-trade market. Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year; this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards.In his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.In April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"Additional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.Only a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental groups. Health care. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use. Both bills had passed the state legislature with broad bipartisan support. Youngkin explained his veto of the latter bill by claiming that such a policy would have caused higher costs for consumers. According to The Washington Post, this claim conflicted with national studies showing that the policy would have decreased costs for consumers. The publication also noted that Youngkin's veto of that bill was in opposition to \"the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan study commission\". Immigration. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget took $10 million over two years that had been planned as financial aid for undocumented immigrants pursuing higher education in Virginia and used the money instead to increase financial aid for students attending Virginia's historically black colleges and universities. The amendment was passed by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. According to The Washington Post, half of the money reallocated by the amendment will be \"used to supplement in-state student aid at Norfolk State and Virginia State universities, which are both public institutions\" and the other half will be used to \"increase Virginia Tuition Assistance Grants, a form of aid for residents attending private colleges and universities, to $7,500 from $5,000 a year for students enrolled in historically Black institutions.\" Lamont Bagby, chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, condemned the amendment, calling it the wrong way to help HBCUs. Several Democrats characterized the amendment as an effort to \"pit\" two different disadvantaged student groups against each other. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Youngkin could have drawn from \"up to $50 million in unappropriated money\" in state revenue to assist Virginia's HBCUs, rather than taking money that had been initially allocated to assist undocumented immigrant students. LGBTQ rights. Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage, but has said he would not interfere with the issue as governor. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said that he considers same-sex marriage \"legally acceptable\" and that \"as governor, [he] would support [legal same-sex marriage].\" He has maintained the governor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Board but has been criticized by members of that board for what they have described as his lack of meaningful support for the LGBTQ+ community.In June 2022, Youngkin expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month; he hosted \"a private Pride reception at the Capitol\" but did not invite any of Virginia's openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. Those who boycotted the event did so because they saw it as inconsistent with Youngkin's policy stances, which they considered to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. That same month, Youngkin hosted the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ+ Republican group, at the Governor's Mansion. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which wrote that Youngkin's choice to celebrate Pride Month \"dismays many people of faith\".In July 2022, shortly after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if that court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can't live in the world of hypotheticals.\""}]}, "correct": false}

Charlotte was home to numerous motorcycle gangs at the time, including the Outlaws, but under Finazzo's leadership, the Hells Angels were able to take control of much of the city's criminal rackets and operated drug, prostitution and motorcycle theft rings throughout the state. During the Hells Angels' international rally held at a private campground on Kerr Lake on July 4, 1981, journalists covering the event for The Charlotte Observer were assaulted by Hells Angels members. Staff reporters Robin Clark and Tex O'Neill were punched and photographer Mark Sluder was forced to turn over his film at knifepoint. The attack was stopped when O'Neill alerted FBI agents who were also observing the rally. Michael Finazzo and his lieutenant Tyler Duris \"Yank\" Frndak were found shot dead and stuffed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile 88 in Randolph County on September 26, 1981. At the time, Finazzo was considered by police to be among the ten most powerful members of the club. Although the murders remain unsolved, police believe that the killings were related to a feud with the Outlaws or a power struggle within the Hells Angels. Club members from across the United States, as well as Canada, Denmark, England and the Netherlands, attended the burials of both men, which took place in Marshville on October 1, 1981.

Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an explosive ordnance disposal unit from the Fort Jackson Army base was required to disarm the trap. Scarnechia and Campbell were sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting the federal agent on January 6, 1983. The Charlotte chapter was at one point the Hells Angels' largest on the east coast, with approximately a dozen members and numerous associates, but was disbanded after its position became precarious following the murders of Finazzo and Frndak, and the imprisonment of Scarnechia. The chapter clubhouse, known as \"the Bunker\", was burned down in a suspected arson attack on August 12, 1985. Investigators believe that the Hells Angels themselves destroyed the property before their departure. Ohio. The United States Department of Justice has stated that the Hells Angels have been involved in contract killings and drug trafficking with the Cleveland crime family.The New York chapter of the Hells Angels was involved in a large-scale brawl with the Breed, in which knives, chains and clubs were brandished, at a motorcycle trade show in Cleveland on March 6, 1971. The violence led to the deaths of five bikers; Breed members Bruce Emerick, Andrew Demeter, Amelio Gardull and Thomas A. Terry, and Hells Angels member Jeffrey \"Groover\" Coffey. Twenty-three people were also injured, including three police officers. Eighty-four people were arrested at the scene.

The deposit bag contained about $4000 in cash and was not taken. Three members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang; Steven Wayne Yee, Mark Verdi, and John Ray Bonds were carrying out a hit. The Cleveland Hells Angels were planning to retaliate against a Sandusky Outlaw gang member for the Joliet, IL shooting of a Hells Angels member the previous year, at which Bonds had been present. The Outlaw member drove a van almost identical to Hartlaub's. The trio mistook Hartlaub's van for their  and shot and killed him by mistake. Both the gun and the van's carpet were spattered with blood, allowing police to use DNA evidence, and discovered that John Ray Bonds was the shooter who had hid inside Hartlaub's van and was waiting to kill him. He shot him with a MAC-11 9-mm semi-automatic pistol fitted with a homemade silencer. Bonds's DNA profile analyzed by the FBI matched the bloodstains found in Yee's car and based on this they were able to use it as key evidence. This was one of the first cases of DNA being used for criminal conviction. The trial and legal wrangling lasted nearly two years and ended in long prison terms for all three Hells Angels members, who remain in prison on sentences up to life. Mark Verdi was released in 2019.

Police have stated that the Hells Angels have avoided Oregon since 1967, when the state was ceded to the Gypsy Jokers to quell a San Francisco, California-area drug war between the clubs.Hells Angels prospect Robert \"Bugeye Bob\" McClure was convicted of quadruple murder and sentenced to four consecutive life terms in July 1994 for the shootings of Margo Compton, her six-year-old twin daughters, Sylvia and Sandra, and Gary Seslar, the son of her boyfriend, in Gaston on August 7, 1977. McClure's alleged accomplice in the killings, Hells Angels hangaround Benjamin \"Psycho\" Silva, was never charged in the case; prosecutors felt it wasn't worth the expense and effort as he was already on death row for the 1981 kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of two college students in Lassen County, California. Odis \"Buck\" Garrett, the Hells Angels Vallejo, California chapter president, ordered the killings of Compton and her daughters in retaliation for her testimony against several Hells Angels in a 1976 San Francisco prostitution trial. Garrett, a one-time millionaire methamphetamine dealer already serving a life term in California on a narcotics conviction, was found guilty on four counts of murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences in prison in July 1995. Garrett died in prison aged seventy-four on February 12, 2017. Pennsylvania. An alliance between the Pagans and the Philadelphia crime family has historically prevented the Hells Angels from establishing a presence in the Philadelphia area. In March 2002, a South Philadelphia tattoo parlor owned by a Pagans member who had been involved in a brawl with the Hells Angels on Long Island, New York the previous month was firebombed in what authorities suspect was a retaliatory attack by the Angels. A HAMC member was stabbed numerous times during a fight between the rival clubs in Northeast Philadelphia in November 2002. The unattended clubhouse of the Sons of Satan, a Pagans support club, was destroyed by a pipe bomb explosion in Rapho Township on December 13, 2002. The case has yet to be officially solved, although authorities believe it to be the work of the Hells Angels.A HAMC chapter was formed in West Philadelphia in 2004 after four high-ranking Pagans members \u2013 Mark \"Slow Poke\" Mangano, Anthony \"Mint-Condition\" Mengine, Thomas \"Thinker\" Wood and James \"Slim Jim\" Wysong \u2013 patched over the year before. On January 1, 2005, Hells Angels member Vincent \"Honcho\" Heinrich was airlifted to Cooper University Hospital after being assaulted by a group of Pagans outside a bar in Woodland Township, New Jersey, allegedly prompting the Angels' New York-based East Coast leader John \"The Baptist\" Lo Franco to declare war on the Philadelphia Pagans chapter. Wood, the Philadelphia Hells Angels vice-president, was shot dead while driving his GMC pickup truck on the Schuylkill Expressway after he and fellow HAMC member Byron \"B&E\" Evans departed a go-go bar in the early hours of January 15, 2005. Two men in a Chevrolet Suburban began firing at Evans, who was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and Wood swerved in an attempt to shield Evans when he was fatally shot in the head. Pagans members Robert \"Go Fast\" Gray and Steven \"Gorilla\" Mondevergine were questioned by police in relation to the murder, which has gone unsolved. On October 31, 2005, Pagans members allegedly stole a sign standing in front of the Hells Angels' clubhouse, resulting in an exchange of gunfire.

Tartikoff focused on promising programs, such as Hill Street Blues and Cheers, and moved them to better time slots. The network's fortunes began to turn with shows like The A-Team and Late Night with David Letterman. In 1984, The Cosby Show's success led to a resurgence in sitcoms and NBC's rise in the ratings. The network also increased in-house productions and launched a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations. By 1988, NBC had 17 series in Nielsen's Top 30 and ranked first in the weekly ratings for over a year.", "text": "In Wheeling, NBC ultimately upgraded its affiliation when it partnered with WTOV-TV in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, overtaking former affiliate WTRF-TV in the ratings by a large margin. Other smaller television markets like Yuma, Arizona waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate (first with KIVA, and later KYMA). The stations in Baltimore, Columbia, Dayton, Jacksonville, Savannah, and Temple, however, have since rejoined the network, although El Dorado went to a full-time Fox affiliate after a long association with ABC, Green Bay switched to CBS several years after being associated with ABC, and Bakersfield, where it went to ABC several years after it was a CBS affiliate. In case of Rapid City, the KOTA calls now resist on a station owned by Gray Television.After President Jimmy Carter pulled the U.S. team out of the 1980 Summer Olympics, NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network's future in doubt. It had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.The press was merciless towards Silverman, but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC's \"Proud as a Peacock\" image campaign created a parody song called \"Loud as a Peacock\", which was broadcast on Don Imus' program on WNBC radio in New York. Its lyrics blamed Silverman for the network's problems (\"The Peacock's dead, so thank you, Fred\"). An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, though technology eventually allowed its wide propagation to the Internet in later generations from a few remaining copies. Saturday Night Live writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled \"A Limo For A Lame-O\", where he presented a chart with the top-10 rated programs for that season and commented that there was \"not one N\" on the list. Silverman later admitted he \"never liked Al Franken to begin with\", and the sketch ruined Franken's chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of SNL following his 1980 departure (with the position going to Jean Doumanian, who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985). Tartikoff's turnaround. Fred Silverman eventually resigned as entertainment president in the summer of 1981. Grant Tinker, a highly regarded producer who co-founded MTM Enterprises with his former wife Mary Tyler Moore, became the president of the network while Brandon Tartikoff became the president of the entertainment division. Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms, but showed patience with promising programs. One such show was the critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues, which suffered from poor ratings during its first season. Rather than canceling the show, he moved the Emmy Award-winning police drama from Steven Bochco to Thursdays, where its ratings improved dramatically. He used the same tactics with St. Elsewhere and Cheers. Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher-rated competition because of their desirable demographics, upscale adults ages 18\u201334. While the network claimed moderate successes with Gimme a Break!, Silver Spoons, Knight Rider, and Remington Steele, its biggest hit during this period was The A-Team, which, at 10th place, was the network's only program to rank in the Nielsen Top-20 for the 1982\u201383 season, and ascended to fourth place the following year. These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983\u201384 season, which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.In February 1982, NBC canceled Tom Snyder's The Tomorrow Show and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian David Letterman. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his weekday morning talk show effort for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), Late Night with David Letterman proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise that continues to this day.. In 1984, the huge success of The Cosby Show led to a renewed interest in sitcoms, while Family Ties and Cheers, both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings (the latter ranking at near dead last among all network shows during the 1982\u201383 season), saw their viewership increase from having Cosby as a lead-in. The network rose from third place to second in the ratings during the 1984\u201385 season and reached first place in 1985\u201386, with hits The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, 227, Night Court, Highway to Heaven, and Hunter. The network's upswing continued late into the decade with ALF, Amen, Matlock, L.A. Law, The Hogan Family, A Different World, Empty Nest, Unsolved Mysteries, and In the Heat of the Night. In 1986, Bob Wright was appointed as chairman of NBC.. In 1985, NBC became the first American television network to broadcast programs in stereo. NBC started repairing its old affiliations that were previously wooed by ABC, such as Savannah, Temple and Columbia, followed by Jacksonville in 1988. It also repaired WOWT, a station formerly affiliated with CBS, in 1986.In the fall of 1987, NBC conceived a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations, under the brand \"Prime Time Begins at 7:30\", consisting of five sitcoms that each aired once a week, and were produced by various production companies contracted by NBC. The series included Marblehead Manor (from Paramount Television, airing Mondays), centering on a mansion owner and the people who live with him; She's the Sheriff (from Lorimar-Telepictures and airing Tuesdays), a comeback vehicle for Suzanne Somers which cast her as a widowed county sheriff; a series adapted from the George S. Kaufman play You Can't Take It with You (airing Wednesdays), starring Harry Morgan; Out of This World (from MCA Television and airing Thursdays), which starred Maureen Flannigan as a teenager born to an alien father and human mother that develops supernatural abilities on her 13th birthday; and a revival of the short-lived 1983 NBC series We Got It Made (produced by Fred Silverman for MGM Television and closing out the week on Fridays), as part of an ongoing trend at the time in which former network series were revived in first-run syndication. The sitcom checkerboard concept was first tested on station KCRA in Sacramento early in 1986, and consists of five different shows in the checkerboard pattern, such as The New Gidget, One Big Family, Mama's Family, Throb and It's a Living (two of these, as Mama's Family and It's a Living are syndicated revivals of the network sitcoms that were axed early in the decade).The package was aimed at attracting viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, 7:00 p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived as a result of the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30 p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987\u201388 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.. That year, in 1987, NBC is planning on to increase output of in-house productions for next year, such as a series of half-hour dramedies, and made an experimental sitcom lineup for Thanksgiving weekend (November 29) that would consist of four sitcoms on the lineup, which consists of Night Court, Beverly Hills Buntz, Family Ties and My Two Dads, and the low ratings for NBC's daytime lineup caused by the creation of the new soap opera that was set for spring 1988, Generations. At the same time, NBC confirms its plans to integrate its NBC Enterprises division with NBC-TV and Corporate Communications, with Enterprises merchandising and foreign sales becoming part of NBC-TV and guest relations and studio tours were added to the Corporate Communications branch, and a new operation service, NBC Operations & Services was created.NBC aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. The 1988\u201389 season saw NBC have an astounding 17 series in Nielsen's year-end Top 30 most-watched network programs; it also ranked at first place in the weekly ratings for more than 12 months, an unprecedented achievement that has not been duplicated since."}]}, "correct": false}

The decision had little impact on ratings and was eventually moved to a later timeslot. NBC's ratings improved in the 2010-11 season due to the success of NBC Sunday Night Football, but the network still struggled to find hit shows. The network underwent a change in leadership and ownership in 2010, with Comcast acquiring a majority stake in NBC Universal. NBC's broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics saw a ratings increase but a loss in advertising revenue. The network's ratings were mostly boosted by its successful shows such as The Voice, Sunday Night Football, and Chicago Fire, leading NBC to become the No. 1 network in the 18-49 demographic in the 2013-14 season for the first time since 2003-04. However, the network's success was mixed in the following seasons, with some new shows failing to gain traction and others, like The Blacklist, experiencing a decline in viewership. NBC's dominance in the 2010s faded during the 2019-20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a major disruption in the network's programming.", "text": "In doing so, NBC became the first major U.S. broadcast network in decades, if ever, to broadcast the same program in a week daily prime time strip. Its executives called the decision \"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\" and \"in effect, launching five shows.\" Conversely, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas in the 10:00 hour, and expressed concern that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted series. Citing complaints from many affiliates, which saw their late-evening newscasts drop significantly in the local ratings during The Jay Leno Show's run, NBC announced on January 10, 2010, that it would drop Leno's show from the 10:00 p.m. slot, with Zucker announcing plans to shift the program (which would have been reduced to a half-hour) into the 11:35 p.m. slot and shift its existing late night lineup (including The Tonight Show) by 30 minutes. The removal of The Jay Leno Show from its prime time schedule had almost no impact on the network's ratings. The increases NBC experienced in the 2010\u201311 season compared to 2009\u201310 were almost entirely attributable to the rising viewership of NBC Sunday Night Football. By 2012, the shows that occupied the 10:00 p.m. time slot drew lower numbers than The Jay Leno Show did when it aired in that hour two years before. In the spring of 2010, cable provider and multimedia firm Comcast announced it would acquire a majority interest in NBC Universal from General Electric, which would retain a minority stake in the company in the interim.. On September 24, 2010, Jeff Zucker announced that he would step down as NBC Universal's CEO once the company's merger with Comcast was completed at the end of the year. After the deal was finalized, Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment. In 2011, NBC was finally able to find a breakout hit in the midseason reality singing competition series The Voice. Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with every single new fall program getting cancelled by season's end \u2013 the third time this has happened to the network after the fall of 1975, and the fall of 1983 \u2013 and the midseason legal drama Harry's Law being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the 2011\u201312 season. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning time slot leased by the Qubo consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when Last Call with Carson Daly converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.. The 2011\u201312 season was another tough season for NBC. On the upside, the network's broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI was the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time, and the network's Monday night midseason lineup of The Voice and musical-drama Smash was very successful. The network managed to lift itself into third place in the 18\u201349 demographic in the 2011\u201312 season, primarily on the strength of those three programs (SNF, The Voice, and Smash), breaking the network's eight-year streak in fourth place. Four shows survived for a second season, but three of them were cancelled in the following year, none were unqualified ratings successes, and the network remained a distant fourth place in total viewership.. In the fall of 2012, NBC greatly expanded its sitcom roster, with eight comedy series airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. NBC bounced back to first place network in adults 18\u201349 that fall, boosted by the new season of The Voice, the initial success of freshman drama Revolution and sitcom Go On, and the continued strength of Sunday Night Football. However, withholding the new season of The Voice and benching Revolution until late March, the network's midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network Univision during the February sweeps period. The 2012\u201313 season ended with NBC finishing in third place overall, albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (Revolution, Chicago Fire and Hannibal).. In 2013, NBC Sports migrated its business and production operations (including NBCSN) to new facilities in Stamford, Connecticut. Production of the network's NFL pre-game show Football Night in America remained at the NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center (with production operations based in Studio 8G, while the program itself was broadcast in Studio 8H, the longtime home of Saturday Night Live), until it migrated to the Stamford facility in September 2014. Despite the failure of another highly advertised game show event, The Million Second Quiz, the 2013\u201314 season was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football and Grimm. Along with new hits including The Blacklist, Hannibal and Chicago PD and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC became the No. 1 network in the coveted 18\u201349 demographic that season for the first time since 2003\u201304, when Friends ended. NBC also improved considerably in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season.The 2014\u201315 season was something of a mixed bag for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18\u201349 demographic and in second place overall.The 2015\u201316 season was successful for NBC, with the successful launch of the new drama Blindspot premiering after The Voice, then subsequently being renewed for a second season in November 2015. NBC also continued with the success with the Chicago franchise with launching its second spin-off Chicago Med, which also received an early second season pick up in February 2016. Thursday nights continues to be a struggle for NBC, with continued success with the third season of The Blacklist brought the failed launch of Heroes Reborn which was cancelled in January 2016, and thriller The Player; however, NBC found success with police procedural Shades of Blue, which improved in its timeslot and was renewed for a second season in February 2016. On the comedy side, NBC surprisingly found success in the new workplace sitcom Superstore which premiered as a \"preview\" after The Voice in November 2015, and officially launched in January 2016 which brought decent ratings for a new comedy without The Voice as a lead-in and which was subsequently renewed for a second season in February 2016.. The 2016\u201317 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of comedy-drama This Is Us, which was well received by critics and ratings and was renewed for two additional seasons in January 2017. The Blacklist continued to bring in modest ratings, but it brought the failed launch of its spinoff The Blacklist: Redemption. NBC continued to grow the Chicago franchise with a third spinoff titled Chicago Justice. On the comedy side, workplace sitcom Superstore continued success in its second season. The network launched new fantasy sitcom The Good Place following The Voice and brought in modest ratings and was renewed for a second season in January 2017. Another highlight of the 2016\u201317 season was The Wall, which premiered to modest ratings and would air in the summer time period prior to the 2017\u201318 season.. The 2017\u201318 season brought continued success for NBC with the premiere of Ellen's Game of Games and the return of Will & Grace, the latter of which previously aired its final episode in 2006. The 2018\u201319 season would continue the network's success with the premieres of The Titan Games, Manifest, Songland, and New Amsterdam, all of which would be renewed for additional seasons; however, The Village and The Enemy Within would not make it past their first seasons. The network's dominance of the 2010s would fade during the 2019\u201320 season, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption in production of the network's programming. The pandemic caused the IOC and the Japanese government to reach an agreement to postpone the 2020 Summer Olympics to the summer of 2021, resulting in the network having to rely on alternative programming for the summer of 2020. The network later moved to #2 in the Nielsen ratings (behind only CBS) in 2021, then reclaimed its status the top-rated network in 2022.  Further reading. Hilmes, Michele (2007).

During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The creation of WEAF in 1922 offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of \"chain\" or \"networking\" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.. New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.. In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. Red and Blue Networks. RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shutting down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.. WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the \"Red Network\" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the \"Blue Network\" mostly carried sustaining \u2013 or non-sponsored \u2013 broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.. In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures. Chimes. The iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as \"the fourth chime\", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations staffed by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G'-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference General Electric (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose radio station in Schenectady, New York, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network. As an example, it is incorporated into the theme music used by NBC News. In the late 1930s, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached an agreement with NBC for B&O to be allowed to NBC's tones to summon the railroad's passengers to dinner on its trains. New beginnings: The Blue Network becomes ABC. In 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency's creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.. After Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply \"NBC\". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed. Defining radio's golden age. NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create."}]}, "correct": true}

NBC's coverage of V-E Day and the 1947 World Series contributed to the growth of television. Under the leadership of Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver in the late 1940s and early 1950s, NBC launched successful shows such as Today, The Tonight Show, and Wide Wide World. NBC also commissioned the first opera written for television, Amahl and the Night Visitors, in 1951. In the mid-1950s, NBC began broadcasting in color and aired the first live color production of Peter Pan in 1955. NBC also acquired the rights to Walt Disney's anthology series in 1961 and began airing it in color. By 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color and began billing itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" In the late 1960s, the networks, including NBC, moved to clean house of veteran shows to attract the large youth population. NBC acquired the broadcast rights to The Wizard of Oz in 1967, which it aired annually until 1976 when CBS re-acquired the rights.", "text": "Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program. Also in 1944, \"The War As It Happens\" came to television on a weekly basis.. \"The War As It Happens\" began as a local program, but NBC records indicate that in April 1944, it was fed to Schenectady and Philadelphia on the fledgling NBC Television Network and became the first news cast regularly seen in multiple cities. On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast several hours of news coverage and remotes from around New York City. This event was promoted in advance by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York area. At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Hotel Astor panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television's rapid growth after the war ended.. The NBC television network grew from its initial post-war line-up of four stations. The 1947 World Series featured two New York City area teams (the Yankees and the Dodgers), and television sales boomed locally, since the games were being telecast in the New York market. Additional stations along the East Coast and in the Midwest were connected by coaxial cable through the late 1940s, and in September 1951 the first transcontinental telecasts took place.. The post-war 1940s and early 1950s brought success for NBC in the new medium. Television's first major star, Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theatre began in June 1948, drew the first large audiences to NBC Television. Under its innovative president, Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver, the network launched Today and The Tonight Show, which would bookend the broadcast day for over 50 years, and which still lead their competitors. Weaver, who also launched the genre of periodic 90-minute network \"spectaculars\", network-produced motion pictures and the live 90-minute Sunday afternoon series Wide Wide World, left the network in 1955 in a dispute with its chairman David Sarnoff, who subsequently named his son Robert Sarnoff as president.. In 1951, NBC commissioned Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera ever written for television; Menotti came up with Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year. Color television. While rival CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the United States, their system was incompatible with the millions of black and white sets in use at the time. After a series of limited, incompatible color broadcasts (mostly scheduled during the day), CBS abandoned the system and broadcasts. This opened the door for the RCA-compatible color system to be adopted as the U.S. standard. RCA convinced the FCC to approve its color system in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming within days of the commission's decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, The Marriage.. In 1955, NBC broadcast a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's beloved play, on the Producers' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.. In 1956, NBC started a subsidiary, California National Productions (CNP), for merchandising, syndication and NBC opera company operations with the production of Silent Services. By 1957, NBC planned to remove the opera company from CNP and CNP was in discussion with MGM Television about handling syndication distribution for MGM series.During a National Association of Broadcasters meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program The Bell Telephone Hour, which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.. In 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color. Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as Walt Disney Presents) on ABC; however, ABC president Leonard Goldenson said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.. By 1963, much of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of I Dream of Jeannie and Convoy), and began billing itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the 1966\u201367 season. Days of Our Lives became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.. NBC contracted with Universal Studios in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, See How They Run, which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, The Hanged Man, aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.In 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.. The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS, and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows."}]}, "correct": false}

NBC was divided into the Red and Blue Networks, focusing on commercial and non-commercial programming, respectively. In 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks.

NBC hosted many popular performers and programs, including Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, and Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra.", "text": "Radio. Earliest stations: WEAF and WJZ. During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The creation of WEAF in 1922 offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of \"chain\" or \"networking\" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.. New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.. In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. Red and Blue Networks. RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shutting down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.. WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the \"Red Network\" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the \"Blue Network\" mostly carried sustaining \u2013 or non-sponsored \u2013 broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.. In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures. Chimes. The iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as \"the fourth chime\", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations staffed by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G'-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference General Electric (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose radio station in Schenectady, New York, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network. As an example, it is incorporated into the theme music used by NBC News. In the late 1930s, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached an agreement with NBC for B&O to be allowed to NBC's tones to summon the railroad's passengers to dinner on its trains. New beginnings: The Blue Network becomes ABC. In 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency's creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.. After Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply \"NBC\". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed. Defining radio's golden age. NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create."}]}, "correct": false}

Light is also essential for the representation of the human figure in painting, affecting volume and generating different limits according to the play of light and shadow.", "text": "In human perception, light creates closeness and darkness creates remoteness, so that a light-darkness gradient gives a sensation of depth.Aspects such as contrast, relief, texture, volume, gradients or the tactile quality of the image depend on light. The play of light and shadow helps to define the location and orientation of objects in space. For their correct representation, their shape, density and extension, as well as their differences in intensity, must be taken into account. It should also be taken into account that, apart from its physical qualities, light can generate dramatic effects and give the painting a certain emotional atmosphere.Contrast is a fundamental factor in painting; it is the language with which the image is shaped. There are two types of contrast: the \"luminous\", which can be by chiaroscuro (light and shadow) or by surface (a point of light that shines brighter than the rest); and the \"chromatic\", which can be tonal (contrast between two tones) or by saturation (a bright color with a neutral one). Both types of contrast are not mutually exclusive, in fact they coincide in the same image most of the time. Contrast can have different levels of intensity and its regulation is the artist's main tool to achieve the appropriate expression for his work. From the contrast between light and shadow depends the tonal expression that the artist wants to give to his work, which can range from softness to hardness, which gives a lesser or greater degree of dramatization. Backlighting, for example, is one of the resources that provide greater drama, since it produces elongated shadows and darker tones.. The correspondence between light and shadow and color is achieved through tonal evaluation: the lightest tones are found in the most illuminated areas of the painting and the darkest in those that receive less illumination. Once the artist establishes the tonal values, he chooses the most appropriate color ranges for their representation. Colors can be lightened or darkened until the desired effect is achieved: to lighten a color, lighter related colors \u2014 such as groups of warm or cool colors \u2014 are added to it, as well as amounts of white until the right tone is found; to darken, related dark colors and some blue or shadow are added. In general, the shade is made by mixing a color with a darker shade, plus blue and a complementary of the proper color (such as yellow and dark blue, red and primary blue or magenta and green).The light and chromatic harmony of a painting depends on color, i.e. the relationship between the parts of a painting to create cohesion. There are several ways to harmonize: it can be done through \"monochrome and tone dominant melodic ranges\", with a single color as a base to which the value and tone is changed; if the value is changed with white or black it is a monochrome, while if the tone is changed it is a simple melodic range: for example, taking red as the dominant tone can be shaded with various shades of red (vermilion, cadmium, carmine) or orange, pink, violet, maroon, salmon, warm gray, etc. Another method is the \"harmonic trios\", which consists of combining three colors equidistant from each other on the chromatic circle; there can also be four, in which case we speak of \"quaternions\". Another way is the combination of \"warm and cool thermal ranges\": warm colors are for example red, orange, purple and yellowish green, as well as black; cool colors are blue, green and violet, as well as white (this perception of color with respect to its temperature is subjective and comes from Goethe's Theory of Colors). It is also possible to harmonize between \"complementary colors\", which is the one that produces the greatest chromatic contrast. Finally, \"broken ranges\" consist of neutralization by mixing primary colors and their complementary colors, which produces intense luminous effects, since the chromatic vibration is more subtle and the saturated colors stand out more. Techniques. The quality and appearance of the luminous representation is in many cases linked to the technique used. The expression and the different light effects of a work depend to a great extent on the different techniques and materials used. In drawing, whether in pencil or charcoal, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality, where white is generally the color of the paper (there are colored pencils, but they produce little contrast, so they are not very suitable for chiaroscuro and light effects). Pencil is usually worked with line and hatching, or by means of blurred spots. Charcoal allows the use of gouache and chalk or white chalk to add touches of light, as well as sanguine or sepia. Another monochrome technique is Indian ink, which generates very violent chiaroscuro, without intermediate values, making it a very expressive medium.. Oil painting consists of dissolving the colors in an oily binder (linseed, walnut, almond or hazelnut oil; animal oils), adding turpentine to make it dry better. The oil painting is the one that best allows to value the light effects and the chromatic tones. It is a technique that produces vivid colors and intense effects of brightness and brilliance, and allows a free and fresh stroke, as well as a great richness of textures. On the other hand, thanks to its long permanence in a fluid state, it allows for subsequent corrections.For its application, brushes, spatulas or scrapers can be used, allowing multiple textures, from thin layers and glazes to thick fillings, which produce a denser light.Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil of various mineral colors, with binders (kaolin, gypsum, gum arabic, fig latex, fish glue, candi sugar, etc.), kneaded with wax and Marseilles soap and cut into sticks. The color should be spread with a smudger, a cylinder of leather or paper used to smudge the color strokes. Pastel combines the qualities of drawing and painting, and brings freshness and spontaneity.Watercolor is a technique made with transparent pigments diluted in water, with binders such as gum arabic or honey, using the white of the paper itself. Known since ancient Egypt, it has been a technique used throughout the ages, although with more intensity during the 18th and 19th centuries. As it is a wet technique, it provides great transparency, which highlights the luminous effect of the white color. Generally, the light tones are applied first, leaving spaces on the paper for the pure white; then the dark tones are applied.In acrylic paint, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents. The speed of drying allows the addition of multiple layers to correct defects and produces flat colors and glazes. Acrylic can be worked by gradient, blurred or contrasted, by flat spots or by filling the color, as in the oil technique. Genres. Depending on the pictorial genre, light has different considerations, since its incidence is different in interiors than in exteriors, on objects than on people. In interiors, light generally tends to create intimate environments, usually a type of indirect light filtered through doors or windows, or filtered by curtains or other elements. In these spaces, private scenes are usually developed, which are reinforced by contrasts of light and shadow, intense or soft, natural or artificial, with areas in semi-darkness and atmospheres influenced by gravitating dust and other effects caused by these spaces. A separate genre of interior painting is naturaleza muerta or \"still life\", which usually shows a series of objects or food arranged as in a sideboard. In these works the artist can manipulate the light at will, generally with dramatic effects such as side lights, frontal lights, zenithal lights, back lights, back-lights, etc. The main difficulty consists in the correct evaluation of the tones and textures of the objects, as well as their brightness and transparency depending on the material.In exteriors, the main genre is landscape, perhaps the most relevant in relation to light in that its presence is fundamental, since any exterior is enveloped in a luminous atmosphere determined by the time of day and the weather and environmental conditions. There are three main types of landscapes: landscape, seascape, and skyscape. The main challenge for the artist in these works is to capture the precise tone of the natural light according to the time of day, the season of the year, the viewing conditions \u2014 which can be affected by phenomena such as cloud cover, rain or fog \u2014 and an infinite number of variables that can occur in a medium as volatile as the landscape. On numerous occasions artists have gone out to paint in nature to capture their impressions first hand, a working method known by the French term en plen air (\"in the open air\", equivalent to \"outdoors\"). There is also the variant of the urban landscape, frequent especially since the 20th century, in which a factor to take into account is the artificial illumination of the cities and the presence of neon lights and other types of effects; in general, in these images the planes and contrasts are more differentiated, with hard shadows and artificial and grayish colors.. Light is also fundamental for the representation of the human figure in painting, since it affects the volume and generates different limits according to the play of light and shadow, which delimits the anatomical profile. Light allows us to nuance the surface of the body, and provides a sensation of smoothness and softness to the skin."}]}, "correct": false}

The Bible's opening phrase \"let there be light\" (Genesis 1:3) underscores the inherent goodness and beauty of light as God's creation. Jesus is identified as the \"light of the world\" (John 8:12), leading to the incorporation of eternal lights and candles in Christian churches. Light symbolism is also present in the Conception of Jesus in Mary and the Incarnation, as well as in baptism, which was initially called \"illumination.\" In Orthodox Christianity, light is considered a \"real aspect of divinity.\" Christian iconography features light in halos of saints, and supernatural lights in night scenes to depict miracles. From the 17th to 18th centuries, philosophical rationalism led to a new symbolism of light identified with knowledge, goodness, or rebirth, and opposed to ignorance, evil, and death. In the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed. Light also has transcendent meanings in other religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Freemasonry. The use of light in painting has been present since prehistoric times and became more experimented during classical Greco-Roman art with adumbration and chiaroscuro techniques.", "text": "Already the Bible begins with the phrase \"let there be light\" (Ge 1:3) and points out that \"God saw that the light was good\" (Ge 1:4). This \"good\" had in Hebrew a more ethical sense, but in its translation into Greek the term \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 (kal\u00f3s, \"beautiful\") was used, in the sense of kalokagath\u00eda, which identified goodness and beauty; although later in the Latin Vulgate a more literal translation was made (bonum instead of pulchrum), it remained fixed in the Christian mentality the idea of the intrinsic beauty of the world as the work of the Creator. On the other hand, the Holy Scriptures identify light with God, and Jesus goes so far as to affirm: \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me will not walk in darkness, for he will have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This identification of light with divinity led to the incorporation in Christian churches of a lamp known as \"eternal light\", as well as the custom of lighting candles to remember the dead and various other rites.. Light is also present in other areas of the Christian religion: the Conception of Jesus in Mary is realized in the form of a ray of light, as seen in numerous representations of the Annunciation; likewise, it represents the Incarnation, as expressed by Pseudo-Saint Bernard: \"as the splendor of the sun passes through glass without breaking it and penetrates its solidity in its impalpable subtlety, without opening it when it enters and without breaking it when it leaves, so the Word God penetrates Mary's womb and comes forth from her womb intact.\" This symbolism of light passing through glass is the same concept that was applied to Gothic stained glass, where light symbolizes divine omnipresence. Another symbolism related to light is that which identifies Jesus with the Sun and Mary as the Dawn that precedes him. In addition to all this, in Christianity light can also signify truth, virtue and salvation. In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be \"plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity\". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called \"illumination\".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a \"real aspect of divinity,\" according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires.. In Christian iconography, light is also present in the halos of the saints, which used to be made \u2014especially in medieval art \u2014 with a golden nimbus, a circle of light placed around the heads of saints, angels and members of the Holy Family. In Fra Angelico's The Annunciation, in addition to the halo, the artist placed rays of light radiating from the figure of the archangel Gabriel, to emphasize his divinity, the same resource he uses with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. On other occasions, it is God himself who is represented in the form of rays of sunlight, as in The Baptism of Christ (1445) by Piero della Francesca. The rays can also signify God's wrath, as in The Tempest (1505) by Giorgione. On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects \u2014 generally made with gold leaf \u2014 was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death. Descartes spoke of an \"inner light\" capable of capturing the \"eternal truths\", a concept also taken up by Leibniz, who distinguished between lumi\u00e8re naturelle (natural light) and lumi\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e (revealed light).In the 19th century light was related by the German Romantics (Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) to nature, in a pantheistic sense of communion with nature. For Schelling, light was a medium in which the \"universal soul\" (Weltseele) moved. For Hegel, light was the \"ideality of matter\", the foundation of the material world.Between the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed. Science had been trying to unravel the nature of light since the early Modern Age, with two main theories: the corpuscular theory, defended by Descartes and Newton; and the wave theory, defended by Christiaan Huygens, Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Later, James Clerk Maxwell presented an electromagnetic theory of light. Finally, Albert Einstein brought together the corpuscular and wave theories.Light can also have a symbolic character in landscape painting: in general, dawn and the passage from night to day represent the divine plan \u2014 or cosmic system \u2014 that transcends the simple will of the human being; dawn also symbolizes the renewal and redemption of Christ. On other occasions, the sun and the moon have been associated with various vital forces: thus, the sun and the day are associated with the masculine, the vital force and energy; and the moon and the night with the feminine, rest, sleep and spirituality, sometimes even death.In other religions light also has a transcendent meaning: in Buddhism it represents truth and the overcoming of matter in the ascent to nirvana. In Hinduism it is synonymous with wisdom and the spiritual understanding of participation with divinity (atman); it is also the manifestation of Krishna, the \"Lord of Light\". In Islam it is the sacred name N\u00fbr. According to the Koran (24:35), \"Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. Light upon light! Allah guides to his light whomever he wills\". In the Zohar of the Jewish Kabbalah the primordial light Or (or Awr) appears, and points out that the universe is divided between the empires of light and darkness; also in Jewish synagogues there is usually a lamp of \"eternal light\" or ner tamid. Finally, in Freemasonry, the search for light is considered the ascent to the various Masonic degrees; some of the Masonic symbols, such as the compass, the bevel and the holy book, are called \"great lights\"; also the principal Masonic officials are called \"lights\". On the other hand, initiation into Freemasonry is called \"receiving the light\". Light is the most joyful of things: it is the symbol of all that is good and wholesome. In all religions it signifies eternal salvation. History. The use of light is intrinsic to painting, so it has been present directly or indirectly since prehistoric times, when cave paintings sought light and relief effects by taking advantage of the roughness of the walls where these scenes were represented. However, serious attempts at greater experimentation in the technical representation of light did not take place until classical Greco-Roman art: Francisco Pacheco, in El arte de la pintura (1649), points out that: \"adumbration was invented by Surias, Samian, covering or staining the shadow of a horse, looked at in the sunlight\". On the other hand, Apollodorus of Athens is credited with the invention of chiaroscuro, a procedure of contrast between light and shadow to produce effects of luminous reality in a two-dimensional representation such as painting."}]}, "correct": true}

The work is a polyptych, with multiple panels that depict various religious scenes, and is considered one of the masterpieces of Early Netherlandish painting. The celestial background of the central panel, which depicts the Lamb of God on an altar surrounded by angels and saints, is particularly notable for its use of light. The background is painted in a luminous blue, with golden rays of light emanating from the Lamb and illuminating the surrounding figures. The effect is one of ethereal beauty, with the light serving to unify the various elements of the composition and create a sense of otherworldly splendor. The Ghent Altarpiece is thus a prime example of the van Eyck brothers' skill in using light to create a sense of spiritual transcendence.", "additional_info": {"top_chunks_info": [{"summary_score": 0.8493236631135654, "summary_rank": 0, "text_score": 0.8486508447476946, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "During the Baroque period, artists in Holland, such as Jordaens, excelled in bright and vibrant coloring with strong contrasts of light and shadow. Jordaens, in particular, deepened the luminous values of his images between 1625 and 1630. Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou, was known for his excellent portraitist skills, often using artificial candlelight in his works. Landscape painting flourished in Holland, with artists like Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Adriaen van de Velde developing a new sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. These artists used light in various ways to create dramatic or serene effects, with some, like Claudio de Lorraine, giving light a primordial importance in their compositions, creating idealized and harmonious conceptions of the world. In contrast, Peter Paul Rubens, a Flemish painter, represented serenity in the face of Tenebrist dramatism, with his robust and sensual figures and optimistic vision of man's relationship with nature.", "text": "Jordaens had a style characterized by a bright and fantastic coloring, with strong contrasts of light and shadow and a technique of dense impasto. Between 1625 and 1630 he had a period in which he deepened the luminous values of his images, in works such as The Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia (1628, Church of Saint Augustine, Antwerp) or The Fecundity of the Earth (1630, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). One should also mention Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou who worked not only in his native country but also in England and Germany. An excellent portraitist, in many of his works he used artificial candlelight or candle light, influenced by Rembrandt, as in Portrait of William III (1692-1697, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), Portrait of James Stuart, Duke of Lennox and Richmond (1692-1696, Leiden Collection, New York), Young Man and Woman Studying a Statue of Venus by Lamplight (c. 1690, Leiden Collection, New York) or Old Man Reading by Candlelight (c. 1700, Museo del Prado, Madrid).. A genre that flourished in Holland in an exceptional way in this century was landscape painting, which, in line with the mannerist landscape painting of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Joos de Momper, developed a new sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. Jan van Goyen was its first representative, followed by artists such as Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle and Adriaen van de Velde. Salomon van Ruysdael sought atmospheric capture, which he treated by tonalities, studying the light of different times of the day. His nephew Jacob van Ruysdael was endowed with a great sensitivity for natural vision, and his depressive character led him to elaborate images of great expressiveness, where the play of light and shadow accentuated the drama of the scene. His light is not the saturating and static light of the Renaissance, but a light in movement, perceptible in the effects of light and shadow in the clouds and their reflections in the plains, a light that led John Constable to formulate one of his lessons on art: \"remember that light and shadow never stand still\". His assistant was Meindert Hobbema, from whom he differed in his chromatic contrasts and lively light effects, which reveal a certain nervousness of stroke. Aelbert Cuyp used a much lighter palette than his compatriots, with a warmer and more golden light, probably influenced by Jan Both's \"Italianate landscape\". He stood out for his atmospheric effects, for the detail of the light reflections on objects or landscape elements, for the use of elongated shadows and for the use of the sun's rays diagonally and backlit, in line with the stylistic novelties produced in Italy, especially around the figure of Claudius of Lorraine. Another genre that flourished in Holland was the still life. One of its best representatives was Willem Kalf, author of still lifes of great precision in detail, which combined flowers, fruits and other foods with various objects generally of luxury, such as vases, Turkish carpets and bowls of Chinese porcelain, which emphasize their play of light and shadow and the bright reflections in the metallic and crystalline surfaces. Classicism and full Baroque. Classicism emerged in Bologna, around the so-called Bolognese School, initiated by the brothers Annibale and Agostino Carracci. This trend was a reaction against mannerism, which sought an idealized representation of nature, representing it not as it is, but as it should be. It pursued the ideal beauty as its sole objective, for which it was inspired by classical Greco-Roman and Renaissance art. This ideal found an ideal subject of representation in the landscape, as well as in historical and mythological themes. In addition to the Carracci brothers, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Guercino and Giovanni Lanfranco stood out.. In the classicist trend, the use of light is paramount in the composition of the painting, although with slight nuances depending on the artist: from the Incamminati and the Academy of Bologna (Carracci brothers), Italian classicism split into several currents: one moved more towards decorativism, with the use of light tones and shiny surfaces, where the lighting is articulated in large luminous spaces (Guido Reni, Lanfranco, Guercino); another specialized in landscape painting and, starting from the Carracci influence \u2014 mainly the frescoes of Palazzo Aldobrandini \u2014 developed along two parallel lines: the first focused more on classical-style composition, with a certain scenographic character in the arrangement of landscapes and figures (Poussin, Domenichino); the other is represented by Claudio da Lorena, with a more lyrical component and greater concern for the representation of light, not only as a plastic factor but as an agglutinating element of a harmonious conception of the work.Claudio de Lorena was one of the baroque painters who best knew how to represent light in his works, to which he gave a primordial importance at the time of conceiving the painting: the light composition served firstly as a plastic factor, being the basis with which he organized the composition, with which he created space and time, with which he articulated the figures, the architectures, the elements of nature; secondly, it was an aesthetic factor, highlighting light as the main sensitive element, as the medium that attracts and envelops the viewer and leads him to a dream world, a world of ideal perfection recreated by the atmosphere of total serenity and placidity that Claudio created with his light. Lorena's light was direct and natural, coming from the sun, which he placed in the middle of the scene, in sunrises or sunsets that gently illuminated all parts of the painting, sometimes placing in certain areas intense contrasts of light and shadow, or backlighting that impacted on a certain element to emphasize it. The artist from Lorraine emphasized color and light over the material description of the elements, which precedes to a great extent the luminous investigations of Impressionism.. Lorraine's capture of light is unparalleled by any of his contemporaries: in the landscapes of Rembrandt or Ruysdael the light has more dramatic effects, piercing the clouds or flowing in oblique or horizontal rays, but in a directed manner, the source of which can be easily located. On the other hand, Claudio's light is serene, diffuse; unlike the artists of his time, he gives it greater relevance if it is necessary to opt for a certain stylistic solution. On numerous occasions he uses the horizon line as a vanishing point, arranging in that place a focus of clarity that attracts the viewer, because that almost blinding luminosity acts as a focalizing element that brings the background closer to the foreground. The light is diffused from the background of the painting and, as it expands, it is enough by itself to create a sensation of depth, blurring the contours and degrading the colors to create the space of the painting. Lorena prefers the serene and placid light of the sun, direct or indirect, but always through a soft and uniform illumination, avoiding sensational effects such as moonlight, rainbows or storms, which were nevertheless used by other landscape painters of her time. His basic reference in the use of light is Elsheimer, but he differs from him in the choice of light sources and times represented: the German artist preferred exceptional light effects, nocturnal environments, moonlight or twilight; on the other hand, Claudio prefers more natural environments, a limpid light of dawn or the refulgence of a warm sunset.. On the other hand, the Flemish Peter Paul Rubens represents serenity in the face of Tenebrist dramatism. In his work, mythological themes stand out \u2014although he was also the author of numerous religious works \u2014 in which he shows an aesthetic ideal of feminine beauty of robust figures and carnal sensuality, with a certain feeling of natural purity that gives his canvases a kind of dreamy candor, an optimistic and integrating vision of man's relationship with nature. He was a master in finding the precise tonality for the flesh tones of the skin, as well as its different textures and the multiple variants of the effects of brightness and the reflections of light on the flesh. Rubens had an in-depth knowledge of the different techniques and traditions related to light, and so he was able to assimilate both Mannerist iridescent light and Tenebrist focal light, internal and external light, homogeneous and dispersed light. In his work, light serves as an organizing element of the composition, in such a way that it agglutinates all the figures and objects in a unitary mass of the same light intensity, with different compositional systems, either with central or diagonal illumination or combining a light in the foreground with another in the background. In his beginnings he was influenced by the Caravaggist chiaroscuro, but from 1615 he sought a greater luminosity based on the tradition of Flemish painting, so he accentuated the light tones and marked the contours more. His images stand out for their sinuous movement, with atmospheres built with powerful lights that helped to organize the development of the action, combining the Flemish tradition with the Venetian coloring that he learned in his travels to Italy."}]}, "correct": true}

El Greco's style shifted from Venetian-inspired lighting to a more mystical, unnatural light, symbolizing the preeminence of faith. His execution involved dark to light tones and shimmering effects. Caravaggio, a pioneer of chiaroscuro and tenebrism, used light as a structural element in painting, creating sharp contrasts and dramatic effects. His diagonal entry of light became a hallmark of his style. Artemisia Gentileschi, trained by her father and influenced by Caravaggio, used expressive light and chiaroscuro to dramatize her scenes. The Baroque period saw increased scientific study of light, leading to more accurate and symbolic use of light in painting, often as a compositional element and with a focus on naturalism and chiaroscuro.", "text": "Among his last works stands out The Adoration of the Shepherds (1612-1613, Museo del Prado, Madrid), where the focus of light is the Child Jesus, who radiates his luminosity around producing phosphorescent effects of strong chromatism and luminosity. El Greco's illumination evolved from the light coming from a specific point \u2014or in a diffuse way \u2014 of the Venetian school to a light rooted in Byzantine art, in which the figures are illuminated without a specific light source or even a diffuse light. It is an unnatural light, which can come from multiple sources or none at all, an arbitrary and unequal light that produces hallucinatory effects. El Greco had a plastic conception of light: his execution went from dark to light tones, finally applying touches of white that created shimmering effects. The refulgent aspect of his works was achieved through glazes, while the whites were finished with almost dry applications. His light is mystical, subjective, almost spectral in appearance, with a taste for shimmering gleams and incandescent reflections. Barroco. In the 17th century, the Baroque emerged, a more refined and ornamented style, with the survival of a certain classicist rationalism but with more dynamic and dramatic forms, with a taste for the surprising and the anecdotal, for optical illusions and the effect blows. Baroque painting had a marked geographical differentiating accent, since its development took place in different countries, in various national schools, each with a distinctive stamp. However, there is a common influence coming again from Italy, where two opposing trends emerged: naturalism (also called caravagism), based on the imitation of natural reality, with a certain taste for chiaroscuro \u2014 the so-called tenebrism \u2014 and classicism, which is just as realistic but with a more intellectual and idealized concept of reality. Later, in the so-called \"full baroque\" (second half of the 17th and early 18th centuries), painting evolved to a more decorative style, with a predominance of mural painting and a certain predilection for optical effects (trompe-l'\u0153il) and luxurious and exuberant scenographies.. During this period, many scientific studies on light were carried out (Johannes Kepler, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, Robert Boyle), which influenced its pictorial representation. Newton proved that color comes from the spectrum of white light and designed the first chromatic circle showing the relationships between colors. In this period the maximum degree of perfection was reached in the pictorial representation of light and the tactile form was diluted in favor of a greater visual impression, achieved by giving greater importance to light, losing the form the accuracy of its contours. In the Baroque, light was studied for the first time as a system of composition, articulating it as a regulating element of the painting: light fulfills several functions, such as symbolic, modeling and illumination, and begins to be directed as an emphatic element, selective of the part of the painting to be highlighted, so that artificial light becomes more important, which can be manipulated at the free will of the artist. Sacred light (nimbus, haloes) was abandoned and natural light was used exclusively, even as a symbolic element. On the other hand, the light of different times of the day (morning, twilight) began to be distinguished. Illumination was conceived as a luminous unit, as opposed to the multiple sources of Renaissance light; in the Baroque there may be several sources, but they are circumscribed to a global and unitary sense of the work.In the Baroque, the nocturne genre became fashionable, which implies a special difficulty in terms of the representation of light, due to the absence of daylight, so that on numerous occasions it was necessary to resort to chiaroscuro and lighting effects from artificial light, while the natural light should come from the moon or the stars. For artificial light, bonfires, candles, lanterns, lanterns, candles, fireworks or similar elements were used. These light sources could be direct or indirect, they could appear in the painting or illuminate the scene from outside. Naturalism. Chiaroscuro resurfaced during the Baroque, especially in the Counter-Reformation, as a method of focusing the viewer's vision on the primordial parts of religious paintings, which were emphasized as didactic elements, as opposed to the Renaissance \"pictorial decor\". An exacerbated variant of chiaroscuro was tenebrism, a technique based on strong contrasts of light and shadow, with a violent type of lighting, generally artificial, which gives greater prominence to the illuminated areas, on which a powerful focus of directed light is placed. These effects have a strong dramatism, which emphasizes the scenes represented, generally of religious type, although they also abound in mythological scenes, still lifes or vanitas. One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and Jos\u00e9 de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action.. Artemisia Gentileschi trained with her father, Orazio Gentileschi, coinciding with the years when Caravaggio lived in Rome, whose work she could appreciate in San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria del Popolo. His work was channeled in the tenebrist naturalism, assuming its most characteristic features: expressive use of light and chiaroscuro, dramatism of the scenes and figures of round anatomy. His most famous work is Judith beheading Holofernes (two versions: 1612-1613, Museo Capodimonte, Naples; and 1620, Uffizi, Florence), where the light focuses on Judith, her maid and the Assyrian general, against a complete darkness, emphasizing the drama of the scene. In the 1630s, established in Naples, his style adopted a more classicist component, without completely abandoning naturalism, with more diaphanous spaces and clearer and sharper atmospheres, although chiaroscuro remained an essential part of the composition, as a means to create space, give volume and expressiveness to the image."}]}, "correct": true}

An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one. Church was Cole's first disciple, who transmitted to him his vision of a majestic and exuberant nature, which he reflected in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner, whose atmospheric effects are seen in works such as In the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D. C.), a lake between mountains seen after a storm, with the sun's rays breaking through the clouds. Heade was devoted to country landscapes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, in meadows of endless horizons with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day, sometimes refracted by humid atmospheres. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism. Handicapped since childhood by polio, he focused on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon, in which light has a special role, a placid light that gives a sense of eternity, of time stopped in a serene perfection and harmony. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style. Bingham masterfully captured in his scenes of the Far West the limpid and clear light of dawn, his favorite when recreating scenes with American Indians and pioneers of the conquest of the West.. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, who excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, deserves special mention. One of his favorite genres was the seascape, in which he displayed a great interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day. His painting Moonlight. Wood Island Lighthouse (1894, Museum of Modern Art, New York) was painted entirely by moonlight, in five hours of work. Another important school was Belgian Luminism. In Belgium, the influence of French Impressionism was strongly felt, initially in the work of the group called Les Vingt, as well as in the School of Tervueren, a group of landscape painters who already showed their interest in light, especially in the atmospheric effects, as can be seen in the work of Isidore Verheyden. Later, Pointillism was the main influence on Belgian artists of the time, a trend embraced by \u00c9mile Claus and Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe, the main representatives of Belgian Luminism. Claus adopted Impressionist techniques, although he maintained academic drawing as the basis for his compositions, and in his work \u2014 mainly landscapes \u2014 he showed great interest in the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions, with a style that sometimes recalls Monet. Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as by the Baroque painter Frans Hals and Spanish painting. His technique was of loose and vigorous brushwork, with great luminous contrasts.A luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, more closely linked to the incipient Fauvism, in which Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, Jan Sluyters, and the early work of Piet Mondrian stood out. Toorop was an eclectic artist, who combined different styles in the search for his own language, such as symbolism, modernism, pointillism, Gauguinian synthetism, Beardsley's linearism, and Japanese printmaking. He was especially devoted to allegorical and symbolic themes and, since 1905, to religious themes.. In Germany, Max Liebermann received an initial realist influence \u2014 mainly from Millet \u2014 and a slight impressionist inclination towards 1890, until he ended up in a luminism of personal inspiration, with violent brushstrokes and brilliant light, a light of his own research with which he experimented until his death in 1935.In Spain, luminism developed especially in Valencia and Catalonia. The main representative of the Valencian school was Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, although the work of Ignacio Pinazo, Teodoro Andreu, Vicente Castell and Francisco Ben\u00edtez Mellado is also noteworthy. Sorolla was a master at capturing the light in nature, as is evident in his seascapes, painted with a gradual palette of colors and a variable brushstroke, wider for specific shapes and smaller to capture the different effects of light. An interpreter of the Mediterranean sun like no other, a French critic said of him that \"never has a paintbrush contained so much sun\". After a period of training, in the 1890s he began to consolidate his style, based on a genre theme with a technique of rapid execution, preferably outdoors, with a thick brushstroke, energetic and impulsive, and with a constant concern for the capture of light, on which he did not cease to investigate its more subtle effects. La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind. It was followed by Pescadores valencianos (1895), Cosiendo la vela (1896) and Comiendo en la barca (1898). In 1900 he visited with Aureliano de Beruete the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was fascinated by the intense chromatism of the Nordic artists, such as Anders Zorn, Max Liebermann or Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer; From here he intensified his coloring and, especially, his luminosity, with a light that invaded the whole painting, emphasizing the blinding whites, as in J\u00e1vea (1900), Idilio (1900), Playa de Valencia (1902), in two versions, morning and sunset, Evening Sun (1903), The Three Sails (1903), Children at the Seashore (1903), Fisherman (1904), Summer (1904), The White Boat (1905), Bathing in J\u00e1vea (1905), etc. They are preferably seascape, with a warm Mediterranean light of which he feels special predilection for that of the month of September, more golden. From 1906 he lowered the intensity of his palette, with a more nuanced tonality and a predilection for mauve ink; he continued with the seascapes, but increased the production of other types of landscapes, as well as gardens and portraits. He summered in Biarritz and the pale and soft light of the Atlantic Ocean made him lower the luminosity of his works. He also continues with his Valencian scenes: Paseo a orillas del mar (1909), Despu\u00e9s del ba\u00f1o (1909). Between 1909 and 1910 his stays in Andalusia induced him to blur the contours, with a technique close to pointillism, with a predominance of white, pink, and mauve. Among his last works is La bata rosa (1916), in which he unleashes an abundance of light that filters through all parts of the canvas, highlighting the use of light and color on the treatment of the contours, which appear blurred.. The Luminist School of Sitges emerged in Catalonia, active in this town in the Garraf between 1878 and 1892. Its most prominent members were Arcadi Mas i Fondevila, Joaquim de Mir\u00f3, Joan Batlle i Amell, Antoni Almirall and Joan Roig i Soler. Opposed in a certain way to the Olot School, whose painters treated the landscape of the interior of Catalonia with a softer and more filtered light, the Sitgetan artists opted for the warm and vibrant Mediterranean light and the atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast. Heirs to a large extent of Fortuny, the members of this school sought to faithfully reflect the luminous effects of the surrounding landscape, in harmonious compositions that combined verism and a certain poetic and idealized vision of nature, with a subtle chromaticism and a fluid brushstroke that was sometimes described as impressionist.The Sitges School is generally considered a precursor of Catalan modernism: two of its main representatives, Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, spent several seasons in the town of Sitges, where they adopted the custom of painting d'apr\u00e8s nature and assumed as the protagonist of their works the luminosity of the environment that surrounded them, although with other formal and compositional solutions in which the influence of French painting is evident. Casas studied in Paris, where he was trained in impressionism, with special influence of Degas and Whistler. His technique stands out for the synthetic brushstroke and the somewhat blurred line, with a theme focused preferably on interiors and outdoor images, as well as popular scenes and social vindication."}]}, "correct": true}

Eug\u00e8ne Boudin and Johan Barthold Jongkind were notable for their plein air seascapes and atmospheric light effects, with Boudin being a teacher to Monet. Adolph von Menzel and Hans Thoma in Germany, as well as Vasili Perov, Iv\u00e1n Kramsk\u00f3i, and Isaak Levit\u00e1n in Russia, were also known for their use of light and realist depictions of workers and peasants. In Spain, Carlos de Haes, Agust\u00edn Riancho, and Joaqu\u00edn Vayreda were influenced by the Barbizon School and captured Spanish and Girona landscapes with detail and lyricism. Mariano Fortuny developed a vibrant colorism with flashing light effects in his paintings. The Macchiaioli in Italy used unfinished forms and color stains to capture the Mediterranean light. The Pre-Raphaelites in Great Britain sought a realistic vision with vivid colors and general lighting, while academicism, represented by William-Adolphe Bouguereau and others, was constrained by strict rules and focused on Greco-Roman classicism. Impressionism, led by artists like Monet, prioritized capturing the \"impression\" of light with loose brushstrokes and a focus on color and optics.", "text": "Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, one of the first landscape painters to paint outdoors, especially seascapes, also stood out as an independent artist. He achieved great mastery in the elaboration of skies, shimmering and slightly misty skies of dim and transparent light, a light that is also reflected in the water with instantaneous effects that he knew how to capture with spontaneity and precision, with a fast technique that already pointed to impressionism \u2014 in fact, he was Monet's teacher.Naturalistic landscape painting had another outstanding representative in Germany, Adolph von Menzel, who was influenced by Constable and developed a style in which light is decisive for the visual aspect of his works, with a technique that was a precursor of impressionism. Also noteworthy are his interior scenes with artificial light, in which he recreates a multitude of anecdotal details and luminous effects of all kinds, as in his Dinner after the Ball (1878, Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin). Next to him stands out Hans Thoma, who was influenced by Courbet, who in his works combined the social vindication of realism with a still somewhat romantic feeling of the landscape. Thoma was an exponent of a \"lyrical realism\", with landscapes and paintings of peasant themes, usually set in his native Black Forest, characterized by the use of a silver-toned light.. In the Netherlands there was the figure of Johan Barthold Jongkind, considered a pre-impressionist, whom Monet also considered his master. He was a great interpreter of atmospheric phenomena and of the play of light on water and snow, as well as of winter and night lights \u2014 his moonlit landscapes were highly valued.. In Russia, a notable realist school also emerged, which developed both in landscape and genre scenes, generally endowed with a strong sense of social denunciation. Its main representatives were Vasili Perov, Iv\u00e1n Kramsk\u00f3i, Isaak Levit\u00e1n, and especially, Ili\u00e1 Repin.. In Spain, Carlos de Haes, Agust\u00edn Riancho and Joaqu\u00edn Vayreda deserve to be mentioned. Haes, of Belgian origin, traveled the entire Spanish geography to capture its landscapes, which he captured with an almost topographical detail. Riancho had a predilection for mountain scenery, with a coloring with a certain tendency to dark shades, free and spontaneous. Vayreda was the founder of the so-called Olot School. Influenced by the Barbizon School, he applied this style to the Girona landscape, with works of diaphanous and serene composition with a certain lyrical component of bucolic evocation.. Also in Spain it is worth mentioning the work of Mariano Fortuny, who found his personal style in Morocco as a chronicler of the African War (1859-1860), where he discovered the colorfulness and exoticism that would characterize his work. Here he began to paint with quick sketches of luminous touches, with which he captured the action in a spontaneous and vigorous way, and which would be the basis of his style: a vibrantly executed colorism with flashing light effects, as is denoted in one of his masterpieces, La vicar\u00eda (1868-1870, Museo Nacional de Arte de Catalu\u00f1a, Barcelona).. Another landscape school was the Italian school of the Macchiaioli (Silvestro Lega, Giovanni Fattori, Telemaco Signorini), of anti-academic style, characterized by the use of stains (macchia in Italian, hence the name of the group) of color and unfinished forms, sketched, a movement that preceded Impressionism. These artists painted from life and had as their main objective the reduction of painting to contrasts of light and brilliance. According to Diego Martelli, one of the theorists of the group, \"we affirmed that form did not exist and that, just as in light everything results from color and chiaroscuro, so it is a matter of obtaining tones, the effects of the true\". The Manchists revalued the light contrasts and knew how to transcribe in their canvases the power and clarity of the Mediterranean light. They captured like no one else the effects of the sun on objects and landscapes, as in the painting The Patrol by Giovanni Fattori, in which the artist uses a white wall as a luminous screen on which the figures are cut out. In Great Britain, the school of the Pre-Raphaelites emerged, who were inspired \u2014 as their name indicates \u2014 by Italian painters before Raphael, as well as by the recently emerged photography, with exponents such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt and Ford Madox Brown. The Pre-Raphaelites sought a realistic vision of the world, based on images of great detail, vivid colors and brilliant workmanship; as opposed to the side lighting advocated by academicist painting, they preferred general lighting, which turned paintings into flat images, without great contrasts of light and shadow. To achieve maximum realism, they carried out numerous investigations, as in the painting The Rescuer (1855, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), by John Everett Millais, in which a fireman saves two girls from a fire, for which the artist burned wood in his workshop to find the right lighting. The almost photographic detail of these works led John Ruskin to say of William Holman Hunt's The Wandering Sheep (1852, Tate Britain, London) that \"for the first time in the history of art the absolutely faithful balance between color and shade is achieved, by which the actual brightness of the sun could be transported into a key by which possible harmonies with material pigments should produce on the mind the same impressions as are made by the light itself.\" Hunt was also the author of The Light of the World (1853, Keble College, Oxford University), in which light has a symbolic meaning, related to the biblical passage that identifies Christ with the phrase \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, for he shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This painter again portrayed the symbolic light of Jesus Christ in The Awakening of Consciousness (1853, Tate Britain), through the light of the garden streaming through the window. Romanticism and realism were the first artistic movements that rejected the official art of the time, the art taught in the academies \u2014 academicism \u2014 an art that was institutionalized and anchored in the past both in the choice of subjects and in the techniques and resources made available to the artist. In France, in the second half of the 19th century, this art was called art pompier (\"fireman's art\", a pejorative name derived from the fact that many authors represented classical heroes with helmets that resembled fireman's helmets). Although in principle the academies were in tune with the art produced at the time, so we can not speak of a distinct style, in the 19th century, when the evolutionary dynamics of the styles began to move away from the classical canons, academic art was constrained in a classicist style based on strict rules. Academicism was stylistically based on Greco-Roman classicism, but also on earlier classicist authors, such as Raphael, Poussin or Guido Reni. Technically, it was based on careful drawing, formal balance, perfect line, plastic purity and careful detailing, together with realistic and harmonious coloring. Many of its representatives had a special predilection for the nude as an artistic theme, as well as a special attraction for orientalism. Its main representatives were: William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, E\u00f9gene-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. Impressionism. Light played a fundamental role in impressionism, a style based on the representation of an image according to the \"impression\" that light produces to the eye. In contrast to academic art and its forms of representation based on linear perspective and geometry, the Impressionists sought to capture reality on the canvas as they perceived it visually, so they gave all the prominence to light and color. To this end, they used to paint outdoors (en plen air), capturing the various effects of light on the surrounding environment at different times of the day. They studied in depth the laws of optics and the physics of light and color. Their technique was based on loose brushstrokes and a combination of colors applied according to the viewer's vision, with a preponderance of contrast between elementary colors (yellow, red and blue) and their complements (orange, green and violet). In addition, they used to apply the pigment directly on the canvas, without mixing, thus achieving greater luminosity and brilliance.Impressionism perfected the capture of light by means of fragmented touches of color, a procedure that had already been used to a greater or lesser extent by artists such as Giorgione, Titian, Guardi and Vel\u00e1zquez (it is well known that the Impressionists admired the genius of Las Meninas, whom they considered \"the painter of painters\"). For the Impressionists, light was the protagonist of the painting, so they began to paint from life, capturing at all times the variations of light on landscapes and objects, the fleeting \"impression\" of light at different times of the day, so they often produced series of paintings of the same place at different times. For this they dispensed with drawing and defined form and volume directly with color, in loose brushstrokes of pure tones, juxtaposed with each other."}]}, "correct": false}

Predecessors of modern nightlife were the kafanas, oriental style bistros. The very first one in Belgrade was opened during the Ottoman period, in 1522, in Dor\u0107ol. Believed to be the oldest such venue in Europe, it served only Turkish coffee. This was only a year after the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade, and 33 years before the first kafana was opened in Istanbul in 1555. There are no historical sources to why Belgrade was so important at the time to have such venue so early. Ottoman traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi visited Belgrade in 1661 and counted 21 khans and 6 caravanserais. The largest, Caravanserai of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had \"160 chimneys\", and some had harem sections. When Austrians conquered Belgrade in 1718, among other reports to the imperial court in Vienna, they sent a report on kafanas naming them: \"Crni orao\", \"Crveni petao\", \"Pet \u0161eva\", \"Tri zeca\", \"Divlji \u010dovek\", etc. They especially addressed the problematic \"Kod dve bule\", notorious favorite place of the \"debauched\" Baron Franz von der Trenck.Belgrade remained rich in kafanas in this period as there were almost 200 kafanas and meyhanas, so production of alcoholic beverages in the city bloomed to meet the demand. Austrian governor, Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, was known for his love of the night life. He abolished all taxes on drink serving, and business blossomed. There were some 140 kafanas and pubs in the German section of the city, and over 200 in the Serbian sector. The former mostly served beer, and the latter wine and rakia. In the 1717-1723 period, four breweries were opened in Belgrade. Duke also organized balls in his palace. In the periods when the balls were organized, music in other parts of the city was forbidden. Common citizens were sometimes forcefully dragged to the balls. where they had to pay the entry fee of 17 kreuzers, which was too high. The aristocracy mostly used the commoners as a laughingstock at the balls, and those who refused to come or made problems at the balls, were jailed and whipped. A massive, lush dinners and feasts, known as traktacije, were organized. They included meals out of reach for the common people, like caviar, octopuses, salted herrings, fried pigeons, hot chocolate or imported wines. After the return of the Ottomans in 1739, this \"baroque blitz\" of Belgrade's nightlife ended.After the recapturing, at the corner of the modern Kralja Petra and Cara Du\u0161ana streets, kafana \"Crni orao\", the first such facility with the recorded word kafana in its name, survived. It served coffee and nargile. The object was also important for other reasons. It was also the first brewery in Belgrade, and the first venue to work 24/7. On the floor above dwelled guardsmen, the crew of the fortress' Timi\u0219oara Gate. As their duty was 24/7, so were the kafana's working hours. The building survived until the Interbellum.White Bear Tavern was opened in the 18th century in the town of Zemun. The building was constructed in the first half of the 17th century and served as caravanserai (khan) at least since 1658. Popular venue stayed in business until the early 1960s. It is the oldest surviving building in urban Belgrade, beside the Belgrade Fortress walls. However, Zemun developed independently from Belgrade and for the most part during history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the House at 10 Cara Du\u0161ana Street in Dor\u0107ol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.The word kafana, introduced by the Ottomans (qahve hane), was derived from the Persian qahvah\u2013khanah, meaning \"coffee house\". English version appeared for the first time in 1615, published by George Sandys after his travels to Constantinople. Golden age. Prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 codified hospitality objects in 1847, dividing them into mehanas and khans, with former given the rank of craft shops. For a long time venues remained unchanged: clothless tables, loosen chairs and benches, tinplate furnaces fired by the guests themselves, tallow candles or petroleum lamps light. A culture of spending hours in kafanas developed among the lower classes. They discussed daily events, politics, shared funny stories or sang with gusle. But development of westernized venues began, built after the examples in Vienna or Budapest. They became gathering spots for officers, clerks, landowners, and, unlike traditional kafanas, occasionally they had women guests. Princess Ljubica Obrenovi\u0107 was a regular visitor of the fancy \"Manojlova ba\u0161ta\", in modern Zeleni Venac, where she was having a beer. It was the first Belgrade's kafana to serve beer, starting in 1835. In time, the crumby-type kafanas mostly remained in suburbia.Staying up late was against the law, but people would regularly stay in kafanas after-hours. As Belgrade had no street lights at the time, the mayor Nikola Hristi\u0107 ordered that every person walking at night must have individual, personal lamp, stipulating high fines. As people coming from the venues at late hours were already breaking the law, they had no lamps, trying to stay unnoticed by the gendarmes. A subculture of bribery developed as for the offenders, when caught, it was less expensive to pay the gendarme than to pay the fine, while the gendarmes were poorly paid anyway.Kafanas became centers of city's social life, as the entire political and cultural pulse of the city radiated from them. Some historians described them as the \"most important institutions\" from the 19th century to World War II. Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 also codified them in 1863, and ordered that women were not allowed to own the kafana nor to work in the village and road ones, but one, or exceptionally two, could work in city kafanas. The venues diversified into various types: mehana, bistro, gostionica, han, saraj, lokal, kr\u010dma, bircuz, birtija and later also restoran, hotel, etc. Though all of them offered drinks, some were also offering food, rest and sleepover. Also, many had music. At the end of the 19th century, downtown Makedonska Street had 40 houses, of which 22 were kafanas. Kafanas were generally diversified: some served only coffee, other served only beer or offered only bean soup. Another codification, this time by the municipality, followed in 1877. Kafanas were categorized - kafanas of the first order were allowed to have one female waitress.As hubs of the social life, kafanas soon diversified: \"Esnafska kafana\" (for craftsmen - bricklayers, masons, well diggers, carpenters, sawyers), \"Makedonija\" (farmers and traders), \"Kod Albanije\" (leaseholders), etc. Depending on the political affiliation of the guests, some kafanas turned into the debate clubs of the Serbian Progressive Party, People's Radical Party or Liberal Party. \"Raji\u0107\" was the first kafana where modern \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i were prepared c.1860. Staple of the Serbian cuisine today, they were so popular that at one moment there were 300 \u0107evabd\u017einicas (\u0107evap\u010di\u0107i grill shops) in Belgrade. Fully named \"Kod Raji\u0107a junaka serbskog\", it hosted the festivities after the complete withdrawal of the Ottomans from Belgrade in 1867, organized by the prince Mihailo. The first hotel, \"Kod jelena\", was built in 1843 but became known as \"Staro zdanje\". It introduced European tradition in entertainment and had the first ballroom in Belgrade. The first ball in Belgrade was held in 1838. They became more frequent after 1860 and had a strict timetable and etiquette. Opposed to this, the vogue of so-called \"potato balls\" spread among the lower classes, especially in the suburban kafanas.

In the new, Communist regime, new types of music became almost obligatory, like the kozara\u010dko kolo, but in the period immediately following the Allied victory this music was mixed with Russian romances, jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. Western music especially became popular after the film Sun Valley Serenade with Glenn Miller's music reached Yugoslav cinemas. Dances included tango, waltz, foxtrot, slowfox, and especially popular trucking, or treskavac in Serbian (\"shaking dance\"). However, with political changes regime's attitude soon switched. By the end of 1945 the American music was labeled as \"capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies\". Accused of undermining discipline and public moral, the trucking was officially banned in the early 1946.

First rock and roll news can be found in press already in 1956.

It appeared that the older generations didn't perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS (\"vocal-instrumental band\").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it.

The club was an offshoot of the Youth Theater DADOV, founded in 1958. The idea was that, through drinks and dance nights, the money for the theater will be collected. Once a week, a Club of the popular music lovers gathered here. The building itself was built in 1921 and was the pre-war house of the Tomi\u0107 family. Performers, some of which launched their careers here, included Elipse, Safiri, Zlatni De\u010daci, Dobri Drugovi, Crni Biseri, Crni Panteri (founded by the students from Congo Kinshasa), Boba Stefanovi\u0107, etc.  When Crni Panteri performed Shake Your Hips, the ecstatic audience trashed and broke the furniture.

Members of the lower classes couldn't afford fancy venues, like hotels \"Slavija\" or \"Imperijal\", to order Wiener schnitzel or Hungarian goulash, to listen to German or French singers or to watch magicians, jugglers and other artists. They were visiting small cookshops, soup kitchens and lowest quality venues. Among the most luxurious and exclusive nightlife locales during the Interbellum was \"Srpski Kralj\", at the corner of Uzun-Mirkova and Pariska streets.

Austrian governor, Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, was known for his love of the night life. He abolished all taxes on drink serving, and business blossomed. There were some 140 kafanas and pubs in the German section of the city, and over 200 in the Serbian sector. The former mostly served beer, and the latter wine and rakia. In the 1717-1723 period, four breweries were opened in Belgrade. Duke also organized balls in his palace. In the periods when the balls were organized, music in other parts of the city was forbidden. Common citizens were sometimes forcefully dragged to the balls. where they had to pay the entry fee of 17 kreuzers, which was too high. The aristocracy mostly used the commoners as a laughingstock at the balls, and those who refused to come or made problems at the balls, were jailed and whipped. A massive, lush dinners and feasts, known as traktacije, were organized. They included meals out of reach for the common people, like caviar, octopuses, salted herrings, fried pigeons, hot chocolate or imported wines. After the return of the Ottomans in 1739, this \"baroque blitz\" of Belgrade's nightlife ended.After the recapturing, at the corner of the modern Kralja Petra and Cara Du\u0161ana streets, kafana \"Crni orao\", the first such facility with the recorded word kafana in its name, survived. It served coffee and nargile. The object was also important for other reasons. It was also the first brewery in Belgrade, and the first venue to work 24/7. On the floor above dwelled guardsmen, the crew of the fortress' Timi\u0219oara Gate. As their duty was 24/7, so were the kafana's working hours. The building survived until the Interbellum.White Bear Tavern was opened in the 18th century in the town of Zemun. The building was constructed in the first half of the 17th century and served as caravanserai (khan) at least since 1658. Popular venue stayed in business until the early 1960s. It is the oldest surviving building in urban Belgrade, beside the Belgrade Fortress walls. However, Zemun developed independently from Belgrade and for the most part during history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the House at 10 Cara Du\u0161ana Street in Dor\u0107ol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.The word kafana, introduced by the Ottomans (qahve hane), was derived from the Persian qahvah\u2013khanah, meaning \"coffee house\". English version appeared for the first time in 1615, published by George Sandys after his travels to Constantinople. Golden age. Prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 codified hospitality objects in 1847, dividing them into mehanas and khans, with former given the rank of craft shops. For a long time venues remained unchanged: clothless tables, loosen chairs and benches, tinplate furnaces fired by the guests themselves, tallow candles or petroleum lamps light. A culture of spending hours in kafanas developed among the lower classes. They discussed daily events, politics, shared funny stories or sang with gusle. But development of westernized venues began, built after the examples in Vienna or Budapest. They became gathering spots for officers, clerks, landowners, and, unlike traditional kafanas, occasionally they had women guests. Princess Ljubica Obrenovi\u0107 was a regular visitor of the fancy \"Manojlova ba\u0161ta\", in modern Zeleni Venac, where she was having a beer. It was the first Belgrade's kafana to serve beer, starting in 1835. In time, the crumby-type kafanas mostly remained in suburbia.Staying up late was against the law, but people would regularly stay in kafanas after-hours. As Belgrade had no street lights at the time, the mayor Nikola Hristi\u0107 ordered that every person walking at night must have individual, personal lamp, stipulating high fines. As people coming from the venues at late hours were already breaking the law, they had no lamps, trying to stay unnoticed by the gendarmes. A subculture of bribery developed as for the offenders, when caught, it was less expensive to pay the gendarme than to pay the fine, while the gendarmes were poorly paid anyway.Kafanas became centers of city's social life, as the entire political and cultural pulse of the city radiated from them. Some historians described them as the \"most important institutions\" from the 19th century to World War II. Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 also codified them in 1863, and ordered that women were not allowed to own the kafana nor to work in the village and road ones, but one, or exceptionally two, could work in city kafanas. The venues diversified into various types: mehana, bistro, gostionica, han, saraj, lokal, kr\u010dma, bircuz, birtija and later also restoran, hotel, etc. Though all of them offered drinks, some were also offering food, rest and sleepover. Also, many had music. At the end of the 19th century, downtown Makedonska Street had 40 houses, of which 22 were kafanas. Kafanas were generally diversified: some served only coffee, other served only beer or offered only bean soup. Another codification, this time by the municipality, followed in 1877. Kafanas were categorized - kafanas of the first order were allowed to have one female waitress.As hubs of the social life, kafanas soon diversified: \"Esnafska kafana\" (for craftsmen - bricklayers, masons, well diggers, carpenters, sawyers), \"Makedonija\" (farmers and traders), \"Kod Albanije\" (leaseholders), etc. Depending on the political affiliation of the guests, some kafanas turned into the debate clubs of the Serbian Progressive Party, People's Radical Party or Liberal Party. \"Raji\u0107\" was the first kafana where modern \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i were prepared c.1860. Staple of the Serbian cuisine today, they were so popular that at one moment there were 300 \u0107evabd\u017einicas (\u0107evap\u010di\u0107i grill shops) in Belgrade. Fully named \"Kod Raji\u0107a junaka serbskog\", it hosted the festivities after the complete withdrawal of the Ottomans from Belgrade in 1867, organized by the prince Mihailo. The first hotel, \"Kod jelena\", was built in 1843 but became known as \"Staro zdanje\". It introduced European tradition in entertainment and had the first ballroom in Belgrade. The first ball in Belgrade was held in 1838. They became more frequent after 1860 and had a strict timetable and etiquette. Opposed to this, the vogue of so-called \"potato balls\" spread among the lower classes, especially in the suburban kafanas. They were named that way as, opposed to the distinguished dances of the rich, at these dance party surrogates people were just jumping and jerking, as if they were kicking potato sacks.The first kafana which allowed guests to stay the entire night \"?"}]}, "correct": false}

In Malta and the Netherlands, police brutality remains a concern despite measures to prevent it. In Poland, instances of police violence have been reported, particularly towards sports fans and the Roma community. Portugal, ranked the fourth most heavily policed country, has a history of police racism, with activists claiming that discrimination is the root cause of police brutality. In Russia, police brutality is prevalent, with reports of torture and false confessions. Slovakia's police brutality is systemic and primarily targeted at the Romani minority, reflecting the nation's racist attitudes towards this group. The text highlights specific incidents of police brutality in each country and calls for reforms to address these issues.", "text": "Government states that use of force was necessary, even though there was no reported example of aggression on the side of protesters. Issues with sports fans. In recent years one of the main sources of controversy concerning Polish police brutality has been the use of rubber bullets to disperse uncooperative crowds at sporting events.. In 1998, major riots occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game. Another set of riots occurred in 2015 in response to a pitch invasion during a football match. Although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit in the neck and later died at the hospital. A former police officer justified the use of weapons as a means to combat football hooliganism. Protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic. Issues with Roma. The Polish police also have a history of police brutality within the Roma community. There are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against the Roma by the police. The European Roma Rights Centre argues that investigations into police brutality cases are seldom carried out and that the police brutality against the Roma minority is systematic.One particular case of police brutality against the Romani people occurred in 1998 when the police took four Roma men to a field and beat them. The men that were beaten were hospitalised for broken bones and other injuries; they were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public. Portugal. Portugal is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world. The police force is divided into five main organisations, with the Pol\u00edcia de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica (PSP) having the most prominent urban presence. The PSP has a diverse range of duties and responsibilities, which include protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring democratic legality.. The use of weapons by Portuguese police is permitted only when: [...] absolutely necessary and when less dangerous means have proved ineffective, and provided that their use is proportionate to the circumstances.. This is restrictive on multiple counts; for example, police are not permitted to use their firearms when an offender is running away. Football hooliganism. Portuguese police have adopted an aggressive position in combating football hooliganism. Despite their means being considered disproportionate, the police view the heavy-handed nature of their tactics as a necessary and successful approach towards protecting the community and maintaining social order.. In 2015, a viral video showed a Benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. The footage, filmed by a local television station, showed Jose Magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers. Although the family appeared calm, Magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, while his father was punched in the face twice. More police rushed to the scene to shield the children aged nine and thirteen.. A statement released by the PSP acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack. The officer was later suspended for 90 days by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.The statement also defended policing the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. Riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in Lisbon as fans celebrated Benfica's title victory. The harsh approach was described as sufficient, justified, and necessary to prevent the social disorder from escalating.In a similar incident in 2016, another football club, Sporting Lisbon, complained about \"barbaric\" police assaults on their fans. Racism. There have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal. In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism. According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001; however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.Racially-influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno Lopes was aggressively searched and physically abused. When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the Alfragide police station requesting information on Lopes' situation. Upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs. The policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained, mistreated, and mocked them for two days.17 police officers from the Alfragide police station were eventually sent to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging, and aggravated kidnapping. {{Update}} As of October 2018, the trial is ongoing, with victims being heard in court.The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has raised concerns about police mistreatment of minorities in Portugal in all of its reports on the country. In its fifth country report of 2018, ECRI mentions the Alfragide case in connection to the failure of IGAI (Inspe\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Interna) or officers higher up in the chain of command to stop the abuses. IGAI is currently the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the Ministry of the Interior like the police forces. In its 2018 report, ECRI recommended that such work should be carried out by the country's Ombudsman, an equality body, or by a new and (entirely) independent body that can be created for that purpose.Portuguese people of Roma descent have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. There are several examples publicized by the media: one case from 2007 involved a Roma man and his son. The two walked to the Nelas police station in Porto to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. Two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.An example of police brutality that occurred in 2012 is the night raid of a Roma campsite by the GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana), in Cabanelas, Vila Verde. Some of the people living in the camp, including children and women, were reportedly attacked by GNR officers. Six Roma that were detained in the operation allege that they were later tortured and humiliated in the GNR station of Amares; the GNR denied the accusations, while SOS Racismo promised to file a complaint against the force. The last remnant of overt institutional racism, in Portugal, is article 81 of GNR's regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people, who in general are known to be mostly Roma; the regulation's constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 1980s. Russia. Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of Vladimir Putin in 2012. More attention has been given to the frequency of police brutality shown on posted videos online. Then-president Dmitry Medvedev initiated reforms of the police force in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralising police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give due process to citizens. Proper investigations into police officials are still considered insufficient by Western standards.In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract false confessions from detainees. Police regulations require officers to meet quotas for solving crimes, which encourages false arrests to meet their numbers. In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian police were seen attacking protesters.In the early days, when Russia was part of the Soviet Union, the secret police and authorities used to detain people and send certain people to the gulags. Slovakia. Police brutality in Slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively enacted on the Romani minority. The nation-state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the Romani minority dating back to before the split of Czechoslovakia. It is widely known that the government practiced forced sterilisation of Romani women and the segregation of the Romani into walled-off settlements; these forms of discrimination have filtered down to the police force. Excessive use of force against the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations. The police force has been repeatedly condemned by several organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention and its treatment of suspects in custody.In 2001, a 51-year-old Romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the Mayor of Magnezitovce and his son who works as a police officer. The victim, Karol Sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten after being forcefully removed from his home. While the mayor's son was immediately removed from the police force and the mayor was suspended from his position, the latter was reinstated four months later. In response to this incident, the Minister for Internal Affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality by including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around the effective use of coercion."}]}, "correct": false}

Under President Idi Amin, many Ugandan people were killed, including minority groups. Many others were tortured. South Africa. Incidents of police brutality skyrocketed by 312% from 2011 to 2012 compared to 2001 to 2002, with only 1 in 100 cases leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action from 2011 to 2012.In 2015, as a result of police officers being accused of crimes such as rape, torture, and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget. The police commissioner at the time, Riah Phiyega, blamed the large number of claims \"on a highly litigious climate\".Police brutality has spread throughout Soweto. Nathaniel Julius was killed in Soweto by police officers from the El Dorado police station. He was a 16 year old boy with Down Syndrome, and was shot because he didn't respond to the police officer calling him. This action was not warranted because Nathaniel didn't have any weapons on him and he was just walking from the store after buying biscuits. Two police officers were arrested over Julius' death on murder charges, after mass protests against this in the area. South African police are commonly accused of excessive force, with ten deaths attributed to police the same year (2020). Ethiopia. Egypt. Police brutality was a major contribution to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Khaled Said's death, though little has changed since. One of the \"demands\" around which people decided to take to the streets in Egypt was \"purging the Ministry of Interior\" for its brutality and torture practices. After six months of reporting gang rape, a woman in Egypt is still seeking justice not only for herself, but also those who were witnesses in her favor and are jailed, tortured in pretrial custody. The lack of investigation into the Fairmont Hotel rape case of 2014 has also put the Egyptian authorities under condemnation. Reportedly, the prime witnesses of the case have been subjected to drug testing, virginity tests and publicly defamed, while their families suffer trauma. Asia. Bangladesh. On February 21, 1952, in Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, students from the University of Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College organized a demonstration to protest the decision to establish Urdu as the only state language. Despite the enforcement of Section 144, which banned public gatherings, the students assembled peacefully. However, police were ordered to disperse the crowd. This led to the use of tear gas and eventually live ammunition against the unarmed students. Several students, including Abdul Jabbar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat, and Abdus Salam, were killed in the crackdown.In May 2017, a man named Shamim Reja was killed by police in the Sonargaon police station. The victim's father claimed that his son was tortured in the police station as the police wanted Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 600,000. Police investigated and the officer-in-charge Arup Torofar, SI Paltu Ghush, and ASP Uttam Prashad were found guilty as charged.In Shahbag, Bangladesh on 26 January 2017, hundreds of protesters against the Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company were taken into custody with extreme force by police officers. The protesters were struck by police officers and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them. China. Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Associations such as Falun Gong have objected against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and which are dispersed by riot police. Chinese protesters have been able to systematize powerful group mobilizations with the use of social media and informal mass communication like Twitter and its Chinese counterparts Weibo.In Xintang, Canton Province (Guangzhou), protests over allegations of corruption and abuse of power abound in the country \u2013 they are the principal cause of discontent in the CCP the then-CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Xintang region, Canton Province (Guangzhou), is an influential textile hub, attracting thousands of workers from all over the country, and what lit the fuse was a complaint of mistreatment against a pregnant migrant worker. Protests on 20 February used a website to urge participants not to shout more anti-government slogans, but to go outside for a quiet walk in the places where they had been deciding to continue the protest. After a brutal police response, the authorities installed corrugated metal fences outside the restaurant and the home of dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes security officers and volunteers with red armbands, pre-emptively positioned in Wangfujing. This presence interrupted the orderly operation of the shops. Hong Kong SAR. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, there were numerous instances of police brutality. Seven police officers were caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed. There had also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. Pictures on local TV and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers' views were blocked, and in some cases, re-emerging with visible injuries. An officer-involved, retired police officer Frankly Chu King-wai was sentenced to three months in prison for causing serious bodily harm.During the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests which gained extensive international coverage, complaints of police brutality increased substantially and broke previous records of complaints.Cases that have caused outrage include the police's mauling and intentional head-shooting of protesters by rubber bullets and rapid tear-gassing of a surrounded crowd. Numerous were critically wounded. Many Hong Kong citizens accuse the police of attempting to murder protesters to deter the people from exercising their freedom of expression.. Amnesty International released a report on 21 June 2019 denouncing the role of the Hong Kong police in the 12 June protest that ended up in bloodshed.Several street conflicts continued in Hong Kong throughout July 2019. Instances of police striking journalists with batons to obstruct their live reporting have been filmed.On the night of 31 August 2019, more than 200 riot police officers entered the Prince Edward MTR station and attacked suspects in a train compartment on the Tsuen Wan line with batons and pepper spray. Many suspects sustained head injuries. Until November 2019, several alleged cases of sexual violence, \"disappearings\", and falling deaths were found to have been directly involved with Hong Kong police brutality, and massive attacks on campus and streets have been also occurring with the concurrent deterioration of the city. Iran. In 1979, authorities stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held many of the workers hostage.. The 2009 Iranian Presidential election protests over the victory of Mahmoud Ahmeninejad, the police and paramilitary forces used excessive force against protestors, injuring and killing many. Many detentions, injuries and deaths of protestors, including children, were also reported on the 2019-2020 protests.In April 2018, a video showed a female member of Iran's morality police slapping a woman and wrestling her to the ground, for allegedly not complying with Iran's mandatory headscarf. The police's actions were widely condemned, including by Iran's vice-president for women's affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar. Iran's interior ministry ordered an inquiry.On September 13, 2022, Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman was detained by authorities. She was announced dead on September 16, 2022, allegedly due to cardiac arrest. However, it was likely due to injuries acquired due to the brutality she encountered. This incident sparked massive protests, and women burning the mandatory headscarf. The head of Tehran's morality police was later suspended. Iraq. Saddam Hussein used to use the police to arrest any one who opposed him. Israel. India. During India's independence struggle, protestors and activists were subject to Lathi charges and shootings.

On 23 January 2017, a pro-jallikattu silent protest in Tamil Nadu turned violent. The National Human Rights Commission consolidated reports that the police used violent methods without prior warning, including beatings and damaging private property, to disperse protesters in Chennai. There were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire. On 15 December 2019 police authorities baton-charged students who were protesting against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act at University Library of Jamia Milia University, New Delhi. The Lathi Charge is very well known in India for excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riots. Indonesia. Islamic extremists in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. In many cases, they are either captured or killed.

Islamic extremists in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. In many cases, they are either captured or killed. There are cases of police corruption involving hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists investigating these claims; one example occurred in June 2012 when Indonesian magazine Tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on 31 August 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody; five people were killed and 34 injured. The police's history of violence goes back to the military-backed Suharto regime (1967\u20131998) when Suharto seized power during an alleged coup and instituted an anti-Communist purge.Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments are light, and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. Amnesty International has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing to ensure that they meet international standards. Malaysia. During the Bersih protests, Malaysian police attacked protesters and killed one. Malaysian police also cane prisoners for several offences, including theft, drug dealing and molestation. Philippines. The discussions of police brutality in the Philippines were revived on 21 December 2020 when a civilian police officer Jonel Nuezca shot his two unarmed neighbors following an argument over an improvised noise maker known locally as boga set up by the victim a day earlier. The incident sparked nationwide outrage and most news organizations linked the incident to the war on drugs. Prior to the incident, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte had made remarks on ordering the police to shoot-to-kill but Duterte \"denied\" it to \"shoot\" on civilians. Singapore. In Singapore, people cannot protest. Police have also caned people for vandalism and other offences. United Arab Emirates. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states have seen many cases of brutality, with some even involving senior figures. For example, Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a United Arab Emirates (UAE) sheikh, was involved in the torture of many business associates. He often recorded some of the abuse. Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him. Amnesty International reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation. UAE prisoners are also treated poorly and tortured. Saudi Arabia. Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.Jamal Khashoggi was a Saudi-American activist and his death inside a Saudi Embassy drew widespread criticism. In October 2018, he went into the Embassy in Turkey. On that same day, a group of Saudi authorities entered the country and intercepted him at the Embassy and killed him soon after. They disposed of his body and then returned to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain. In Bahrain, police and military personnel manhandled and shot dead many Arab Spring protesters. Pakistan. Pakistan's law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers, including forces under provincial and federal government control. The law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals; however, due to deficiencies during the training process, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes.. A recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named \"Rao Anwar\". Taking notice of the matter, the Supreme Court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.In October 2019, the People National Alliance organised a rally to free Kashmir from Pakistani rule. As a result of the police trying to stop the rally, 100 people were injured. Thailand. In 1976, Thai police, military personnel and others, were seen shooting at protesters at Thammasat University. Many were killed and many survivors were abused. Turkey. Turkey has a history of police brutality, including the use of torture particularly between 1977 and 2002. Police brutality featured excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters), pepper spray, and water cannons. Physical violence against protesters has been observed, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and May Day demonstrations. The 2013 protests in Turkey were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of Taksim Gezi Park.. In 2012 several officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of the political activist Engin \u00c7eber.. The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.In 2021, the General Directorate of Security issued a circular banning all audio-visual recordings of law enforcement officers at protests. Turkmenistan. Europe. Austria. In Vienna, there is an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants, which have led to African migrants being racially profiled.There have been several highly publicized incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people\u2014in some cases, to the point of death. While the most notorious of these incidents occurred in the late 1990s, incidents as recent as 2019 are being investigated by the Vienna Police Department for Special Investigations.. 24 April 1996: Nicola Jevremovi\u0107, a Serbian Romani man, tried to pay a friend's parking fine and was harassed by police. He escaped and a group of 25 to 40 police officers entered his home without a warrant. The police officers violently beat him and his wife, Violetta Jevremovi\u0107, in front of their children and then arrested the couple. The couple were made to wait outside for half an hour in front of their neighbours, allegedly to humiliate them. Nicola Jevremovi\u0107 was initially fined for a misdemeanor and found guilty in 1997 of \"resisting arrest\". Violetta Jevremovi\u0107 was found guilty of \"suspicion of resisting arrest\".. November 1998: Dr. C, a black Austrian citizen, was stopped by police after reversing his car into a one-way street and asked, \"Why are you driving the wrong way, nigger?\". He was beaten unconscious and handcuffed. Police continued beating him after he regained consciousness. After he was arrested, he spent 11 days recovering in the hospital.. May 1999: Marcus Omofuma, a Nigerian asylum-seeker, was being deported from Vienna when the officers taped him to his chair \"like a mummy\" and stuck tape over his mouth. He suffocated whilst in police custody.. 1 January 2015: A 47-year-old woman was beaten and taken into custody after refusing to take a breathalyzer test while walking home on New Year's Eve. She suffered a fractured coccyx, and severe bruising to her head and knees. She filed a complaint and received no response. The case was re-examined by the prosecutor only after she found CCTV footage.. 28 July 2015: A 27-year-old man, suspected of being a pickpocket, was handcuffed and violently thrown to the ground while in police custody. Police said that the man had been injured while \"pressing his head against the wall\". Video evidence showed him being passive and compliant before the altercation.There has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians' rights in Austria, with Amnesty International reporting that in 1998\u20131999 very few people who violated human rights were brought to justice. This was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation, and assault.From 2014 to 2015, 250 accusations of police misconduct were made against officers in Vienna with none being charged, though 1,329 people were charged with \"civil disorder\" in a similar time period."}]}, "correct": false}
