People's Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) and writing \"Do not vote for these traitors\" underneath the caption, to which the post was criticised for its divisive language and perceived discreditation on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General's Office against ?oraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology.[281][282] ?oraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.[283]\nOn 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against ?oraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party, which if proven in court, would lead for ?oraev having his M?jilis candidacy be deregistered from the election.[284] The hearings initially set to be held from 6 March, were postponed that same day for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up.[285][286] On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found ?oraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by the court would come into force until election day on 19 March, which nevertheless allowed for ?oraev to remain as a candidate in the race and insisting as the incident being a provocation by the Kazakh government to delegitimise his candidacy.[287]", "Proposals to the Article 272 of the Criminal Code [ edit ]\nThe Senate of Kazakhstan approved a draft law \"On introduction of amendments and

polls were opened to the public.[296] ?mir ?ynybekuly, an independent candidate running in Shymkent II, called on the Prosecutor General's Office to intervene and urged President Tokayev to temporarily suspend the powers of the Shymkent City Akimat.[297] In response, the Shymkent Territorial Election Commission chairman Qaiybek Qunanbaev dismissed the claims of prepared voting protocol results as being \"fake stuffing and provocation\", insisting that election protocols are filled after voting takes place and noted the absence of a seal in the alleged precinct result tallies.[298]\nAfter polls opened on election day, independent monitoring NGO Erkindik Qanaty claimed election violations, which included restrictions on observer movements, limited visibility of the voter registration process, bans on photo and video recording, campaign activities by the precinct election commission chairman, and failure to provide an observer's chair which served as a violation of instructions for equipping the polling station.[299] Voting irregularities emerged across Kazakhstan, with numerous videos captured by independent observers showing instances of ballot box stuffing and carousel voting taking place in polling stations.[300][301] Others at several polling sites witnessed surveillance cameras being covered with tape.[302] Azamat Sar?azin, head of the Public

The first wave, linked to the Bell Beaker culture around 2450 BCE, introduced significant Steppe ancestry, resulting in at least 90% local population turnover by 1500-1000 BCE and the arrival of new Y-chromosome subclades and mtDNA haplogroups. The origin of the Bell Beaker culture's language is contested, with theories suggesting connections to Old European, pre-Celtic, or Proto-Celtic.\n\nThe second wave, originating from France, led to a considerable increase in Early European Farmer ancestry in Britain around 1000 BCE, which might have facilitated the entry of early Celtic languages into the region. A 2022 study supports this hypothesis.\n\nIn the context of these migration waves, DNA analysis of two Bronze Age human remains in Cornwall provides additional insights. A young female from the Early Bronze Age Harlyn Bay site, dated to c. 2285\u20132036 BCE, had mtDNA haplogroup R1b and was modeled as 11.1% Western European Hunter-Gatherer (WHG), 29.5% Early European Farmer (EEF), and 59.4% Steppe ancestry. A Middle Bronze Age individual from a barrow on Constantine Island, dated to c. 1381\u20131056 BCE, was also analyzed.", "text": "The second, a migration into Britain from sources that best fit populations from France, resulted in a substantial increase in Early European Farmer ancestry in Britain between c. 1000 and c. 875 BCE, which a 2022 study has suggested may represent a plausible vector for the introduction of early Celtic languages into Britain.DNA analysis has been performed on the remains of two Cornish Bronze Age humans. At the Harlyn Bay site, an Early Bronze Age cist, the skeleton of a young female directly dated to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age period c. 2285\u20132036 BCE was assigned mtDNA haplogroup R1b. Using a three-way model of ancestral components, this individual could be modelled as 11.1% Western European Hunter-Gatherer (WHG), 29.5% Early European Farmer (EEF), and 59.4% Steppe ancestry. The Bronze Age barrow on Constantine Island contained an ancient individual directly dated to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1381\u20131056 BCE)."}, {"feature_type": "summary", "feature_score": 0.8501465251906789, "feature_rank": 7, "text_score": 0.8081819786930693, "feature": "The Beaker pottery tradition, which was associated with gabbroic clay and began around 2250 BCE, was initially used for food-related activities but may have shifted towards ritual use by the time it ended around 1700 BCE.

Food Vessels and Collared Urns have been found in various sites and barrows, while Trevisker Ware, which emerged in Cornwall around 2000 BCE, became the most common ceramic style of the Early Bronze Age and the only ceramic type used in the Middle Bronze Age. Trevisker Ware was also found in other regions, including Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Kent, Wales, Dalkey Island in County Dublin, and Brittany.

Trevisker Ware has also been found in Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Kent, Wales, Dalkey Island in County Dublin, and Brittany. It continued to be produced in Cornwall for almost a millennium, and ceramic finds from Gwithian indicate that Trevisker Ware was still used in the tenth century BCE.
