However, I can provide a general answer based on the information that is typically included in news reports about protests.\n\nWhen protests turn violent or disruptive, police may use tear gas to disperse the crowd. This can occur in a variety of locations, including:\n\n1. City streets: Protests often take place in urban areas, and police may use tear gas to clear streets and intersections.\n2. Public parks: Protests may also take place in public parks or other outdoor spaces, and police may use tear gas to disperse crowds in these areas.\n3. Government buildings: Protests may target government buildings, such as city halls or capitol buildings, and police may use tear gas to protect these buildings and the people inside.\n4. College campuses: Protests may occur on college campuses, and police may use tear gas to disperse crowds in these areas.\n5. Transportation hubs: Protests may disrupt transportation, such as blocking roads or occupying airports, and police may use tear gas to clear these areas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.

Raising the retirement age: The reform proposes to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, which has been met with opposition from those who believe that people should be able to retire earlier after working for many years.\n2. Reducing benefits: The reform also proposes to reduce pension benefits for some workers, particularly those in the public sector. This has been met with opposition from those who rely on their pensions to maintain their standard of living in retirement.\n3. Perceived unfairness: Some critics argue that the reform is unfair because it disproportionately affects certain groups, such as women and low-income workers. For example, women are more likely to take career breaks to care for children or elderly relatives, which can result in lower pension benefits.\n4. Lack of consultation: The reform has been criticized for being developed without sufficient consultation with unions and other stakeholders. This has led to a sense of mistrust and resistance among those who feel that their voices have not been heard.\n5. Economic uncertainty: The reform is being proposed at a time of economic uncertainty, with many people worried about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their jobs and finances.

However, in general, earthquakes can cause a variety of indirect effects that can lead to flooding.\n\nSome possible indirect effects of earthquakes that could lead to flooding include:\n\n* Dam failure: Earthquakes can damage dams, causing them to fail and release large amounts of water downstream. This can lead to flooding in areas downstream of the dam.\n* Landslides: Earthquakes can trigger landslides, which can block rivers and streams, causing water to build up behind the blockage. This can lead to flooding upstream of the blockage.\n* Ground subsidence: Earthquakes can cause the ground to subside, or sink, in certain areas. This can cause water to pool in those areas, leading to flooding.\n* Liquefaction: Earthquakes can cause the soil to liquefy, or turn into a liquid-like state. This can cause buildings and other structures to sink into the ground, and can also cause water to pool in certain areas, leading to flooding.\n\nTherefore, the answer would depend on the specific indirect effects of the earthquake that led to flooding in Turkey, based on the available information.\n\nScore: 0.5 (This score reflects the fact that I was unable to provide a specific answer to the question due to a lack of necessary information, but provided some possible answers based on general knowledge of earthquakes and their indirect effects.)\n\nScore: 0.5\n\n        Score: 0.5", "additional_info": {"top_chunks_info": [{"summary_score": 0.8788302908740064, "summary_rank": 0, "text_score": 0.8514144979834395, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "The aftermath of the earthquake in Turkey also involved a bus crash in Hatay, resulting in two deaths and six injuries.

The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department.[285] The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards.

In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light.

People's Party of Kazakhstan (QHP) and writing \"Do not vote for these traitors\" underneath the caption, to which the post was criticised for its divisive language and perceived discreditation on the party by the QHP chairman Ermukhamet Ertisbaev, who threatened to file lawsuit to the Prosecutor General's Office against ?oraev for slander unless he deletes the post and offers a public apology.[281][282] ?oraev in response deleted the post but subsequently made a new one taking aim directly at Ertisbaev, where he noted that Ertisbaev had long served as an advisor to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and called on him instead to publicly apologise for his previous YouTube interview with Russian propogandist Vladimir Solovyov where he expressed controversial remarks towards Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving Kazakhs \"from the Nazis during the January events\", reiterating once again for Ertisbaev being a \"traitor\", as well as suggesting to hold a live debate with him.[283]\nOn 5 March 2023, the QHP under the behalf of its plaintiff Nuria Baltabaiqyzy, filed a class action lawsuit against ?oraev for spreading the \"false information\" about the party, which if proven in court, would lead for ?oraev having his M?jilis candidacy be deregistered from the election.[284] The hearings initially set to be held from 6 March, were postponed that same day for 10 March after plaintiff Baltabaiqyzy failed to show up.[285][286] On 14 March, the Interdistrict Court of Astana found ?oraev guilty of disseminating the QHP, though the judicial act decision by the court would come into force until election day on 19 March, which nevertheless allowed for ?oraev to remain as a candidate in the race and insisting as the incident being a provocation by the Kazakh government to delegitimise his candidacy.[287]", "Proposals to the Article 272 of the Criminal Code [ edit ]\nThe Senate of Kazakhstan approved a draft law \"On introduction of amendments and

results as being \"fake stuffing and provocation\", insisting that election protocols are filled after voting takes place and noted the absence of a seal in the alleged precinct result tallies.[298]\nAfter polls opened on election day, independent monitoring NGO Erkindik Qanaty claimed election violations, which included restrictions on observer movements, limited visibility of the voter registration process, bans on photo and video recording, campaign activities by the precinct election commission chairman, and failure to provide an observer's chair which served as a violation of instructions for equipping the polling station.[299] Voting irregularities emerged across Kazakhstan, with numerous videos captured by independent observers showing instances of ballot box stuffing and carousel voting taking place in polling stations.[300][301] Others at several polling sites witnessed surveillance cameras being covered with tape.[302] Azamat Sar?azin, head of the Public

In 1989, two historians, Barrie Dobson and John Taylor, wrote \"Rymes of Robyn Hood\" on the subject. In 1997, Stephen Knight and Thomas H. Ohlgren published Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales, a collection of all the pre-17th-century tales of Robin Hood, arranged in chronological order. Their book now forms the core of the Robin Hood Project of the University of Rochester's Middle English Texts website. In 2013 Ohlgren and linguist Lister M. Matheson published Early Rymes of Robin Hood, which includes \"as-is\" transcriptions of all the earliest surviving copies of Gest for use by scholars.

This culture is thought to have originated from the Lower Rhine region and brought substantial genetic changes, replacing a significant portion of the British Neolithic gene pool. The Bell Beaker culture likely reached Cornwall from other parts of Britain, rather than directly from the European mainland.", "text": "Genetic studies and bone isotope analysis demonstrate long-distance movement both within Britain and from the European mainland at this time, perhaps initially motivated by the search for metals. Travel to and from Cornwall may have led to the spread of a range of ideas and beliefs, as communities in Cornwall interacted with people from distant places, bringing new monument styles and ideologies that would have been interpreted within a framework of previously existing knowledge and practices. Bell Beaker period (c. 2400\u20131700 BCE). The Bell Beaker complex expanded to Britain and Ireland by c. 2450 BCE, bringing new ceramic forms ('Beakers') and burial practices, around the same time as the earliest known metal artefacts in Britain. The spread of the Beaker culture to Britain is associated with the migration of people from mainland Europe, possibly from somewhere in the vicinity of the Lower Rhine. These people carried substantial levels of Yamnaya-related ancestry in their DNA, and are believed to have replaced a minimum of 90% of the British Neolithic gene pool within a few hundred years.Bell Beaker culture was probably introduced to Cornwall from further east in Britain, rather than directly from the European mainland."}, {"summary_score": 0.8518723388743052, "summary_rank": 6, "text_score": 0.8127969186034838, "text_rank": 22, "summary": "In the Bronze Age, two major migration waves took place in Britain. The first wave, linked to the Bell Beaker culture around 2450 BCE, introduced significant Steppe ancestry, resulting in at least 90% local population turnover by 1500-1000 BCE and the arrival of new Y-chromosome subclades and mtDNA haplogroups. The origin of the Bell Beaker culture's language is contested, with theories suggesting connections to Old European, pre-Celtic, or Proto-Celtic.\n\nThe second wave, originating from France, led to a considerable increase in Early European Farmer ancestry in Britain around 1000 BCE, which might have facilitated the entry of early Celtic languages into the region. A 2022 study supports this hypothesis.\n\nIn the context of these migration waves, DNA analysis of two Bronze Age human remains in Cornwall provides additional insights.
