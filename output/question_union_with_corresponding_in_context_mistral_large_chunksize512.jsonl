Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castell\u00f3n. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing \u2014 in particular his mastery of perspective \u2014 drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly.

In 1966 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alc\u00faescar (Commander's Palace of Alc\u00faescar), also known as the Palacio de los Marqueses de Torre Orgaz, in the historic centre of C\u00e1ceres in the province of the same name in Extremadura. Originally built as a medieval fortified residence on pre-existing Arab buildings in 1488, the palace was modified in later centuries, adding Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The Ministry proposed the conversion of one part of the palace into a Hoster\u00eda.The part of the building on which Picardo was to work was a jumble of old buildings, some attached to the main palace building and some free-standing, which had mostly formed stables and coach houses. There was also a patio-garden between these buildings and the palace and its tower.. Picardo began by demolishing most of the ramshackle service buildings, other than the square structure at Number 6 Calle Ancha which benefitted from substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. Picardo decided the lower ground floor of this building would form the bar and cafeter\u00eda, with a doorway from the street which would become the main entrance to the Hoster\u00eda. He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings. Picardo also installed a sgraffito image above the main doorway, featuring the cross of the Orden de Santiago (Order of Santiago).A new one-storey building was erected to the rear of the plot, imitating similar buildings in the city.

It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction."}]}, "correct": false}

If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo's artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\""}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.8845434063300317, "feature_rank": 2, "text_score": 0.8036163553349965, "feature": "Who were the \"maestros\" that Picardo credited in his article, and why did he wonder what they would say about his work?", "text": "With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador.

He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador. He featured hand-painted written ceramic tiles, produced by Juan Manuel Arroyo, to decorate and 'sign' the building, to expound on its history and to credit the surveyor and stoneworker.In an article about the Ja\u00e9n Parador for an architectural magazine in 1967, Picardo rhapsodised about the mood and aura he had created for the building: \"Exterior, un conjunto de masas elementales rectangulares./Interior, techos con artesas, b\u00f3vedas y arcos, madera, barro y piedra. .../Ay del romancero!\" (Outside, a gathering of rectangular blocks./Inside, artesonado ceilings, vaults and arches, wood, clay and stone. .../Oh, the romance!)In the same article Picardo credited his \"maestros\" (masters): \"Torres-Balb\u00e1s, Moya, Sota y Luis Santamaria.

It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret."}]}, "correct": false}

Cerd\u00e0 had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral\u00b7lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Gl\u00f2ries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat.

This increase in buildability caused notable differences between buildings constructed at different times, and led to the presence of numerous party walls that disfigured the urban space, a problem that the city still suffers from despite several projects to remedy it, such as the Barcelona posa't guapa (Barcelona, make yourself pretty) campaign.The post-war urban renewal was led by the head of urban planning of the new authorities, Pedro Bidagor, who in 1945 promoted the creation of the Barcelona Provincial Planning Commission, responsible for drawing up a planning project for the city and its surroundings. Thus arose the Regional Plan of 1953, developed by Josep Soteras, an attempt to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities in order to meet the strong demand for housing in the years of massive immigration, while trying to curb real estate speculation and improve the urban environment. The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte.

The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte.

The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C.

Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265).

In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir \u00a1Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855)."}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.9070312375631799, "feature_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8757735549968685, "feature": "How did Cerd\u00e0's project affect existing suburban layouts and the urban development projects of neighboring towns?", "text": "Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park.

The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany.

The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which \"were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system\". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" and could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\".

Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives."}]}, "correct": true}

Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be. The Guardian touched on political dissatisfaction, comparing the protests to that of the gilet jaunes, which \"were initially against fuel tax rises but evolved to encompass a wider lack of trust in the political system\". Antoine Bristielle, from the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank, opined that the invoking of Article 49.3 could be \"perceived as a symbol of brutality\" and could \"erode support both for the government and democratic institutions\".

The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw\u202f7.

Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdo\u011fan had claimed \"98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999\" and described it \"as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement\"."}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.8978644461931105, "feature_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8438549531299031, "feature": "What is the estimated reconstruction cost in Syria according to the World Bank?", "text": "About half of residential property in the affected area is thought to be covered by Compulsory Earthquake Insurance..

Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington..

At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others..

Agriculture. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale.  Agriculture is probably responsive to climate variability and weather extremes, such as droughts, floods, and severe storms. The forces that shape the climate are also critical to farm productivity. Human activity has already changed atmospheric characteristics such as temperature, rainfall, levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ground level ozone. The scientific community expects such trends to continue. Warmer climate may give positive effects on food production; however, the increased potential for weather extremes will pose challenges for farmers. Moreover, water supply and soil moisture could make it less feasible to continue crop production in certain areas.. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) concluded: Recent studies indicate that increased frequency of heat stress, droughts and floods negatively affect crop yields and livestock beyond the impacts of mean climate change, creating the possibility for surprises, with impacts that are larger and occurring earlier than predicted using changes in mean variables alone. This is especially the case for subsistence sectors at low latitudes. Climate variability and change also modify the risks of fires, pest and pathogen outbreak, negatively affecting food, fiber, and forestry.. Climate Factors. Several factors directly connect climate change and agricultural productivity: Change in precipitation amount and patterns. Rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Pollution levels such as ground level ozone. Change in climatic variability and extreme eventsMost agricultural impact studies have considered the effects of one or two aspects of climate change on a particular farming activity. Few, however, have considered the full set of anticipated shifts and their impact on agricultural production across the country.. The ways in which climate changes in Washington will affect agriculture are largely unknown. One benefit which climate change may potentially have on agriculture is the possibility of longer growing seasons. However, some of the negative effects include reduced water supply and higher demand for water. Some of the unknown effects are changes in the behavior of weeds, pests and crop diseases.. With the shifts in climate, Washington exports of agriculture goods may fluctuate. The impacts of these fluctuations are largely unknown due to the complexity and unknown extent of the changes to come. Yakima Valley.

In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others..

Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington..

The snowpack captures winter precipitation at higher altitudes where it acts as a bank, slowly releasing water during dryer months. The decrease in snowpack levels will lead to earlier peak flows in area streams and rivers, increased flooding, and loss of irrigation and drinking water.

The combination of higher water levels and more catastrophic waves will cause even higher rates of damage to the coast line. These waves will destroy infrastructure that is near the coast including roads, railways, and water treatment systems and will cost the Washington State tax payer untold sums of money to both fix and prepare for.Change in the type of land along the shoreline will also change. Tidal flats will decrease thus effecting the population of shellfish along with other coastal animals. Loss of this land could also lead to the increase of salt marshes and effect the salinity of surrounding areas. The economic effects of such land changes would be the decrease in shellfish supply, and a decrease in land value as marshes grow.The economic importance of the coast is generally easier to measure than its aesthetic value.

Seattle's first plan is to reduce Seattle's dependence on cars which is projected to cut emission by 170,000 tons. Their first plan of action is to significantly increase the supply of frequent, reliable and convenient public transportation. The single largest source of Seattle's GHG's come from the approximate two billion miles driven by gasoline fueled cars and trucks. The success of reducing this is to supply an alternative to driving.

All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington's gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State\u2014Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.  This valley owes its special characteristics (wide-open expanse, wildflowers and views) to its heavy snows and short growing season\u2014keeping it clear of trees."}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.8942054537584393, "feature_rank": 2, "text_score": 0.8447274479016131, "feature": "What kind of ecological impacts are expected as a result of climate change in Washington?", "text": "As global temperatures rise, it causes the oceans to warm up and expand. Ice caps and glaciers also melt, and the amount of rain increases as the amount of snow decreases. All of these factors contribute to the rise in sea level, which is a principal cause of flooding. Homes and businesses within reach of tidewater and low-lying agricultural areas in Washington are at high risks for flooding. Parts of Tacoma and Olympia are at higher risks than other cities like Seattle, since many areas in Tacoma and Olympia are built just a few feet above sea level. It is said that \"shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and recreational facilities associated with coastal port districts are places where impacts will reach more deeply into the state\u2019s economy through effects on commercial and recreational activities\" pg. 65. The areas that are to be affected first by the increased pattern of flooding include Willapa Bay and the Skagit River Delta Ecological impacts. Ecological impacts are expected to be great, with many indicators already visible.  They will be caused both directly (warmer temperatures, greater storm event intensity/frequency, etc.) and indirectly (rising sea level, more frequent wildfires, etc.) by climate change.

For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington..

In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications.

The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil.

Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market.

Over the years roughly half of London's meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on.

The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.

Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations \u2014 that animals need not be put up for sale on market days \u2014 to bypass the marketing system altogether.

Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth's researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. There is a record of market workers sending a wreath to the funeral of George Joseph Cooper MP, admired because at one time Argentina was put on the blacklist and he had tried very hard to get it removed.

Drovers at Deptford market were paid a lump sum per vessel, George Philcox told Booth.  They could unload a cattle boat in as little as 15 minutes. Some cattle, especially from Argentina, were very wild, and were best given \"a wide berth\". A man in regular employment could earn as much as \u00a34 a week (about \u00a3520 purchasing power in 2018 money). Slaughtermen.

The stage play The Gut Girls by Sarah Daniels is a fictionalised version of this incident.. Years later the Duchess of Albany's daughter (aged 95) told the BBC:I never knew such cheerful people.

Over the years roughly half of London's meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on.

Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile.  It was to the business advantage of shippers (hence, liners) that livestock arrive in the Thames on time and in excellent condition.  By 1892 North Atlantic animal losses were reduced to less than 1%, ten times better than on the Buenos Aires run..

The English export trade contributed to the demand for more and better cattle.Stockmen found profitable the exportation of only the choicest grade cattle and attained this quality by upgrading the range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood...  The trade therefore became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.   Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.  \"On the western plains the ranches that succeeded the open range bought high priced sires with which to upgrade their old stock. The upturn in the quality of beef animals, with younger cattle going to the feedlot, meant better beef from the slaughter house and on the family table, all part of a general improvement\". It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.

The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.

When freights were high these vessels were hastily rigged up with temporary decks and crammed tightly with cattle.Risk was greatest in winter, when insurance rates soared to 10% \"as a heavy storm may make it necessary to lighten the ship by throwing the entire deck load of cattle overboard\".In 1879 the British government's chief veterinary officer reported on animals jettisoned from transatlantic cattle ships or dying on board from injury or suffocation.

Plimsoll wrote that cattle ships were dangerously unstable in stormy weather, cruel to animals, and unnecessary.  They were unstable if cattle were carried on the upper deck or (worse) on a temporary, higher platform that raised the ship's centre of gravity even further, and obstructed the crew in their duties.

He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice..

It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it.

The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia.

Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as \"ground zero for Youngkin's victory\", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections.

An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget took $10 million over two years that had been planned as financial aid for undocumented immigrants pursuing higher education in Virginia and used the money instead to increase financial aid for students attending Virginia's historically black colleges and universities. The amendment was passed by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. According to The Washington Post, half of the money reallocated by the amendment will be \"used to supplement in-state student aid at Norfolk State and Virginia State universities, which are both public institutions\" and the other half will be used to \"increase Virginia Tuition Assistance Grants, a form of aid for residents attending private colleges and universities, to $7,500 from $5,000 a year for students enrolled in historically Black institutions.\" Lamont Bagby, chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, condemned the amendment, calling it the wrong way to help HBCUs. Several Democrats characterized the amendment as an effort to \"pit\" two different disadvantaged student groups against each other. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Youngkin could have drawn from \"up to $50 million in unappropriated money\" in state revenue to assist Virginia's HBCUs, rather than taking money that had been initially allocated to assist undocumented immigrant students.

At that time, Youngkin stated his preference for a \"pain threshold bill\", which bans abortion at around twenty weeks. In July 2021, while running for governor, he was caught on a hot mic telling an activist that he would \"start going on offense\" against abortion rights if elected governor but would largely avoid the topic until then, saying \"as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won\u2019t win my independent votes that I have to get.\"As governor, Youngkin introduced a failed amendment to the state budget, that if adopted by the legislature, would have banned the state government from funding abortion services in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. Youngkin claimed that this would have made Virginia's policy on the public funding of abortion services consistent with the federal Hyde Amendment, which allows it only in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the mother's life. In actuality, as noted by the Richmond Public Interest Law Review, Virginia policy on the matter still would have been broader than the Hyde Amendment, as the state law also allows public funding of abortion services when needed to protect the pregnant mother's health.In May 2022, following the leaked draft opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Youngkin joined with Maryland Governor Larry Hogan in calling on the federal government to intervene against peaceful protests targeting the homes of conservative Supreme Court Justices living in Virginia and Maryland.

During the campaign, Youngkin proposed paying for much of his proposed tax cuts with the state's budget surplus, which at the time, was projected to total $2.6 billion. Although The Washington Post and NPR both noted that much of that revenue would be unavailable for tax cuts, since state law required that over half of the amount be devoted to the state's \"rainy day\" reserve fund, water quality improvement fund, and transportation fund, Virginia's budget surplus continued to grow, and by the end of Northam's term, was projected to total at least $13.4 billion for the state's then-upcoming budget cycle.As his campaign's senior economic advisor, Youngkin hired Stephen Moore, who had helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas several years earlier when Sam Brownback was in office as that state's governor. NPR noted towards the end of the Virginia gubernatorial campaign that Youngkin \"sourced much of his fiscal agenda from [Moore].\" In response to Moore's hiring, The Washington Post described the Brownback tax cuts as \"an experiment widely seen as a failure, leading the state to slash spending for priorities such as education and transportation when revenue dried up\". The publication noted that the tax cuts were ultimately repealed \"on a bipartisan vote\". Youngkin's Democratic gubernatorial opponent, Terry McAuliffe, cited the economic downturn in Kansas as a way to critique Youngkin's economic platform. Moore acknowledged after joining the Youngkin campaign that the Brownback tax cuts had negatively impacted the Kansas economy but argued that they should be perceived as an anomaly, saying that several other states \"did really well when they lowered taxes\".In 2022, Youngkin signed a two-year, $165 billion state budget featuring $4 billion in tax cuts.

In March 2022, his administration was awarded a grant from the Biden administration's Labor Department to combat inequities in the Virginia Employment Commission's operations. The grant was made available through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

While critical race theory has been widely discussed by teachers at workshops sponsored by the Virginia Department of Education, it has never been endorsed by the department or included in the state's public school curriculum. In his executive order, Youngkin characterized critical race theory and related concepts as \"political indoctrination\" that \"instruct students to only view life through the lens of race and presumes that some students are consciously or unconsciously racist, sexist, or oppressive, and that other students are victims.\" Frederick Hess, education policy director at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, approved of the order as \"sensible and thoughtful and well-written\".The Washington Post has noted that while critical race theory specifically refers to \"an academic framework that examines how policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism in the United States\", the term has been reappropriated by conservatives \"as a catchall symbolizing schools\u2019 equity and diversity work.\" Youngkin's stance on critical race theory has been condemned by leaders of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, and according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, has \"alarmed many educators\" in the state.

Barrie's beloved play, on the Producers' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.. In 1956, NBC started a subsidiary, California National Productions (CNP), for merchandising, syndication and NBC opera company operations with the production of Silent Services. By 1957, NBC planned to remove the opera company from CNP and CNP was in discussion with MGM Television about handling syndication distribution for MGM series.During a National Association of Broadcasters meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program The Bell Telephone Hour, which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.. In 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color."}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.7998584891468999, "feature_rank": 3, "text_score": 0.7374810245986454, "feature": "Which three shows were not unqualified ratings successes in NBC in the following year?", "text": "On the upside, the network's broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI was the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time, and the network's Monday night midseason lineup of The Voice and musical-drama Smash was very successful.

Techniques. The quality and appearance of the luminous representation is in many cases linked to the technique used. The expression and the different light effects of a work depend to a great extent on the different techniques and materials used. In drawing, whether in pencil or charcoal, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality, where white is generally the color of the paper (there are colored pencils, but they produce little contrast, so they are not very suitable for chiaroscuro and light effects). Pencil is usually worked with line and hatching, or by means of blurred spots. Charcoal allows the use of gouache and chalk or white chalk to add touches of light, as well as sanguine or sepia. Another monochrome technique is Indian ink, which generates very violent chiaroscuro, without intermediate values, making it a very expressive medium.. Oil painting consists of dissolving the colors in an oily binder (linseed, walnut, almond or hazelnut oil; animal oils), adding turpentine to make it dry better.

The use of light is intrinsic to painting, so it has been present directly or indirectly since prehistoric times, when cave paintings sought light and relief effects by taking advantage of the roughness of the walls where these scenes were represented. However, serious attempts at greater experimentation in the technical representation of light did not take place until classical Greco-Roman art: Francisco Pacheco, in El arte de la pintura (1649), points out that: \"adumbration was invented by Surias, Samian, covering or staining the shadow of a horse, looked at in the sunlight\".

If ever an event should be treated at noon, let the sun be hidden among clouds, trees, mountains and buildings, and let that star be pointed out by means of some rays that escape those obstacles. Let it be considered then that the bodies do not give shadows, or little, and that the colors, by the excessive vivacity of the light, appear less vivid than in the hours when the light is more attenuated.. Most art treatises advised the afternoon light, which was the most used especially from the Renaissance to the 18th century. Vasari advised to place the sun to the east because \"the figure that is made has a great relief and great goodness and perfection is achieved\".In the early days of modern painting, the sunset used to be circumscribed to a celestial vault characterized by its reddish color, without an exact correspondence with the illumination of figures and objects. It was again with Leonardo that a more naturalistic study of twilight began, pointing out in his notes that: The reddening of the clouds, together with the reddening of the sun, makes everything that takes light from them redden; and the part of the bodies which is not seen that reddening remains of the color of the air, and whoever sees such bodies seems to him that they are of two colors; and from this you cannot escape since, showing the cause of such shadows and lights, you must make the shadows and lights participants of the said causes, otherwise your work is vain and false.For Milizia this moment is risky, since \"the more splendid these accidents are (the flaming twilight is always an excess), the more they must be observed to represent them well\".Finally, the night has always been a singularity within painting, to the point of constituting a genre of its own: the nocturne. In these scenes the light comes from the moon, the stars or from some type of artificial illumination (bonfires, torches, candles or, more recently, gas or electric light). The justification for a night scene has generally been given from iconographic themes occurring in this time period.

His images stand out for their sinuous movement, with atmospheres built with powerful lights that helped to organize the development of the action, combining the Flemish tradition with the Venetian coloring that he learned in his travels to Italy. Perhaps where he experimented most in the use of light was in his landscapes, most of them painted in his old age, whose use of color and light with agile and vibrant brushstrokes influenced Vel\u00e1zquez and other painters of his time, such as Jordaens and Van Dyck, and artists of later periods such as Jean-Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was undoubtedly the most brilliant artist of his time in Spain, and one of the most internationally renowned. In the evolution of his style we can perceive a profound study of pictorial illumination, of the effects of light both on objects and on the environment, with which he reaches heights of great realism in the representation of his scenes, which however is not exempt from an air of classical idealization, which shows a clear intellectual background that for the artist was a vindication of the painter's craft as a creative and elevated activity. Vel\u00e1zquez was the architect of a space-light in which the atmosphere is a diaphanous matter full of light, which is freely distributed throughout a continuous space, without divisions of planes, in such a way that the light permeates the backgrounds, which acquire vitality and are as highlighted as the foreground. It is a world of instantaneous capture, alien to tangible reality, in which the light generates a dynamic effect that dilutes the contours, which together with the vibratory effect of the changing planes of light produces a sensation of movement. He usually alternated zones of light and shadow, creating a parallel stratification of space. Sometimes he even atomized the areas of light and shadow into small corpuscles, which was a precedent for impressionism.In his youth he was influenced by Caravaggio, to evolve later to a more diaphanous light, as shown in his two paintings of the Villa Medici, in which light filters through the trees."}]}, "correct": false}

In addition to all this, in Christianity light can also signify truth, virtue and salvation. In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be \"plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity\". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called \"illumination\".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a \"real aspect of divinity,\" according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires..

In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects \u2014 generally made with gold leaf \u2014 was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death."}, {"feature_type": "question", "feature_score": 0.8399741318513829, "feature_rank": 2, "text_score": 0.7809680056911372, "feature": "How is the concept of light represented in Christian churches?", "text": "For this 5th century author, \"Light derives from Good and is the image of Goodness\". Later, in the 9th century, John Scotus Erigena defined God as \"the father of lights\". Already the Bible begins with the phrase \"let there be light\" (Ge 1:3) and points out that \"God saw that the light was good\" (Ge 1:4). This \"good\" had in Hebrew a more ethical sense, but in its translation into Greek the term \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 (kal\u00f3s, \"beautiful\") was used, in the sense of kalokagath\u00eda, which identified goodness and beauty; although later in the Latin Vulgate a more literal translation was made (bonum instead of pulchrum), it remained fixed in the Christian mentality the idea of the intrinsic beauty of the world as the work of the Creator. On the other hand, the Holy Scriptures identify light with God, and Jesus goes so far as to affirm: \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me will not walk in darkness, for he will have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This identification of light with divinity led to the incorporation in Christian churches of a lamp known as \"eternal light\", as well as the custom of lighting candles to remember the dead and various other rites.. Light is also present in other areas of the Christian religion: the Conception of Jesus in Mary is realized in the form of a ray of light, as seen in numerous representations of the Annunciation; likewise, it represents the Incarnation, as expressed by Pseudo-Saint Bernard: \"as the splendor of the sun passes through glass without breaking it and penetrates its solidity in its impalpable subtlety, without opening it when it enters and without breaking it when it leaves, so the Word God penetrates Mary's womb and comes forth from her womb intact.\" This symbolism of light passing through glass is the same concept that was applied to Gothic stained glass, where light symbolizes divine omnipresence. Another symbolism related to light is that which identifies Jesus with the Sun and Mary as the Dawn that precedes him.

The light radiates from the objects, which are luminous without the need for the play of volumes that will be characteristic of modern painting. In particular, the use of gold in medieval miniatures generated areas of great light intensity, often contrasted with cold and light tones, to provide greater chromaticism.However, in painting, light did not have the prominence it had in architecture: medieval \"proper light\" was alien to reality and without contact with the spectator, since it neither came from outside \u2014 lacking a light source \u2014 nor went outward, since it did not expand light. Chiaroscuro was not used, since shadow was forbidden as it was considered a refuge for evil. Light was considered of divine origin and conqueror of darkness, so it illuminated everything equally, with the consequence of the lack of modeling and volume in the objects, a fact that resulted in the weightless and incorporeal image that was sought to emphasize spirituality. Although there is a greater interest in the representation of light, it is more symbolic than naturalistic. Just as in architecture the stained glass windows created a space where illumination took on a transcendent character, in painting a spatial staging was developed through gold backgrounds, which although they did not represent a physical space, they did represent a metaphysical realm, linked to the sacred. This \"gothic light\" was a feigned illumination and created a type of unreal image that transcended mere nature.. The \"unnatural\" light of Gothic art is also presented as the bearer of a world of images of great figurative opulence, whose power acts with extraordinary force on the soul of man.. The gold background reinforced the sacred symbolism of light: the figures are immersed in an indeterminate space of unnatural light, a scenario of sacred character where figures and objects are part of the religious symbolism. Cennino Cennini (Il libro dell'Arte), compiled various technical procedures for the use of gold leaf in painting (backgrounds, draperies, nimbuses), which remained in force until the 16th century. Gold leaf was used profusely, especially in halos and backgrounds, as can be seen in Duccio's Maest\u00e0, which shone brightly in the interior of the cathedral of Siena."}]}, "correct": true}

Of his Christ on the Column, Joachim von Sandrart said: \"the brightness of the candles and lights illuminates everything with a naturalness that resembles life so closely that no art has ever reached such heights\".. One of the greatest exponents of the symbolic use of light was Rembrandt, an original artist with a strong personal stamp, with a style close to tenebrism but more diffused, without the marked contrasts between light and shadow typical of the Caravaggists, but a more subtle and diffuse penumbra. According to Giovanni Arpino, Rembrandt \"invented light, not as heat, but as value. He invented light not to illuminate, but to make his world unapproachable\". In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light. Rembrandtian light is a reflection of an external force, which affects the objects causing them to radiate energy, like the retransmission of a message. Although he starts from tenebrism, his contrasts of light and shadow are not as sharp as those of Caravaggio, but he likes more a kind of golden shadows that give a mysterious air to his paintings. In Rembrandt, light was something structural, integrated in form, color and space, in such a way that it dematerializes bodies and plays with the texture of objects. It is a light that is not subject to the laws of physics, which he generally concentrates in one area of the painting, creating a glowing luminosity. In his work, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light.

Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n developed a somewhat sweetened tenebrism, although one of his best works, San Hugo in the refectory of the Carthusian monks (c. 1630, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) stands out for the presence of white color, with a subtle play of light and shadow that stands out for the multiplicity of intensities applied to each figure and object.In Venice, Baroque painting did not produce such exceptional figures as in the Renaissance and Mannerism, but in the work of artists such as Domenico Fetti, Johann Liss, and Bernardo Strozzi one can perceive the vibrant luminism and the enveloping atmospheres so characteristic of Venetian painting.. The Caravaggist novelties had a special echo in Holland, where the so-called Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged, a series of painters who assumed the description of reality and the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio as pictorial principles, on which they developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and the search for new compositional schemes, resulting in a painting that stands out for its optical values. Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti (\"Gerard of the Nights\").

Artemisia Gentileschi trained with her father, Orazio Gentileschi, coinciding with the years when Caravaggio lived in Rome, whose work she could appreciate in San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria del Popolo.

For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other.

Throughout his career he achieved a great mastery in capturing a type of light of atmospheric origin, of the irradiation of light and chromatic vibration, with a fluid technique that pointed to the forms rather than defining them, thus achieving a dematerialized but truthful vision of reality, a reality that transcends matter and is framed in the world of ideas.

The Surrender of Breda (1635, Museo del Prado, Madrid) was a first milestone in his mastery of atmospheric light, where color and luminosity achieve an accentuated protagonism.

Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting: in the former, the landscape \u2014 more centered in the New England area \u2014 is more peaceful, more anecdotal, with delicate tonal gradations characterized by a crystalline light that seems to emanate from the canvas, in neat brushstrokes that seem to recreate the surface of a mirror and in compositions in which the excess of detail is unreal due to its straightness and geometrism, resulting in an idealization of nature.

He spent some formative years in Italy, where he was interested in the effects of fireworks in the sky and painted the eruptions of Vesuvius. One of his masterpieces is Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump (1768, The National Gallery, London), where he places a powerful light source in the center that illuminates all the characters, perhaps a metaphor for the Enlightenment light that illuminates all human beings equally. The light comes from a candle hidden behind the glass jar used to perform the experiment, whose shadow is placed next to a skull, both symbols of the transience of life, often used in vanitas. Wright made several paintings with artificial lighting, which he called candle light pictures, generally with violent contrasts of light and shadow. In addition \u2014 and especially in his paintings of scientific subjects, such as the one mentioned above or A Philosopher Gives a Lesson on the Table Planetarium (1766, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby) \u2014 light symbolizes reason and knowledge, in keeping with the Enlightenment, the \"Age of Enlightenment\".. In the transition between the 18th and 19th centuries, one of the most outstanding artists was Francisco de Goya, who evolved from a more or less rococo style to a certain prerromanticism, but with a personal and expressive work with a strong intimate tone. Numerous scholars of his work have emphasized Goya's metaphorical use of light as the conqueror of darkness. For Goya, light represented reason, knowledge and freedom, as opposed to the ignorance, repression and superstition associated with darkness."}]}, "correct": true}

La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind. It was followed by Pescadores valencianos (1895), Cosiendo la vela (1896) and Comiendo en la barca (1898). In 1900 he visited with Aureliano de Beruete the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was fascinated by the intense chromatism of the Nordic artists, such as Anders Zorn, Max Liebermann or Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer; From here he intensified his coloring and, especially, his luminosity, with a light that invaded the whole painting, emphasizing the blinding whites, as in J\u00e1vea (1900), Idilio (1900), Playa de Valencia (1902), in two versions, morning and sunset, Evening Sun (1903), The Three Sails (1903), Children at the Seashore (1903), Fisherman (1904), Summer (1904), The White Boat (1905), Bathing in J\u00e1vea (1905), etc. They are preferably seascape, with a warm Mediterranean light of which he feels special predilection for that of the month of September, more golden.

Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as by the Baroque painter Frans Hals and Spanish painting. His technique was of loose and vigorous brushwork, with great luminous contrasts.A luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, more closely linked to the incipient Fauvism, in which Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, Jan Sluyters, and the early work of Piet Mondrian stood out. Toorop was an eclectic artist, who combined different styles in the search for his own language, such as symbolism, modernism, pointillism, Gauguinian synthetism, Beardsley's linearism, and Japanese printmaking. He was especially devoted to allegorical and symbolic themes and, since 1905, to religious themes.. In Germany, Max Liebermann received an initial realist influence \u2014 mainly from Millet \u2014 and a slight impressionist inclination towards 1890, until he ended up in a luminism of personal inspiration, with violent brushstrokes and brilliant light, a light of his own research with which he experimented until his death in 1935.In Spain, luminism developed especially in Valencia and Catalonia. The main representative of the Valencian school was Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, although the work of Ignacio Pinazo, Teodoro Andreu, Vicente Castell and Francisco Ben\u00edtez Mellado is also noteworthy. Sorolla was a master at capturing the light in nature, as is evident in his seascapes, painted with a gradual palette of colors and a variable brushstroke, wider for specific shapes and smaller to capture the different effects of light.

Another focus of symbolism was Belgium, where the work of F\u00e9licien Rops, Fernand Khnopff and William Degouve de Nuncques should be noted. The first was a painter and graphic artist of great imagination, with a predilection for a theme centered on perversity and eroticism. Khnopff developed a dreamlike-allegorical theme of women transformed into angels or sphinxes, with disturbing atmospheres of great technical refinement. Degouve de Nuncques elaborated urban landscapes with a preference for nocturnal settings, with a dreamlike component precursor of surrealism: his work The Blind House (1892, Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo) influenced Ren\u00e9 Magritte's The Empire of Lights (1954, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels).. In Central Europe, the Swiss Arnold B\u00f6cklin and Ferdinand Hodler and the Austrian Gustav Klimt stood out. B\u00f6cklin specialized in a theme of fantastic beings, such as nymphs, satyrs, tritons or naiads, with a somber and somewhat morbid style, such as his painting The Island of the Dead (1880, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), where a pale, cold and whitish light envelops the atmosphere of the island where Charon's boat is headed. Hodler evolved from a certain naturalism to a personal style he called \"parallelism\", characterized by rhythmic schemes in which line, form and color are reproduced in a repetitive way, with simplified and monumental figures.

Post-painterly abstraction (also called \"New Abstraction\") focused on geometrism, with an austere, cold and impersonal language, due to an anti-anthropocentric tendency that could be glimpsed in these years in art and culture in general, also present in pop-art, a style with which it coexisted. Thus, post-pictorial abstraction focuses on form and color, without making any iconographic reading, only interested in the visual impact, without any reflection. They use striking colors, sometimes of a metallic or fluorescent nature. Barnett Newman, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly and Kenneth Noland stand out. Minimalism was a trend that involved a process of dematerialization that would lead to conceptual art. They are works of marked simplicity, reduced to a minimum motif, refined to the initial approach of the author. Robert Mangold and Robert Ryman stand out, who had in common the preference for monochrome, with a refined technique in which the brushstroke is not noticed and the use of light tones, preferably pastel colors.Figuration returned again with hyperrealism \u2014 which emerged around 1965 \u2014 a trend characterized by its superlative and exaggerated vision of reality, which is captured with great accuracy in all its details, with an almost photographic aspect, in which Chuck Close, Richard Estes, Don Eddy, John Salt, and Ralph Goings stand out.

Findings and statistics. Since 2004/05, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) published complaint statistics reports for England and Wales. In the 2014/15 annual report, the IPCC reported that there were 17 deaths in or following police custody and only one fatal police shooting from 2014 to 2017. These figures more than doubled when the IPCC was first erected. The annual report for 2015/16 was published on 26 July 2016. A total of 37,105 complaints were recorded in 2014/15, marking a 6% increase to the previous year, and a 62% overall increase since 2004/05. Allegations of \"neglect or failure in duty\" accounted for 34% of all allegations recorded while \"other assault\" and \"oppressive conduct\" or harassment made up only 8% and 6% respectively. Public dissatisfaction and discrimination. Despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to file a complaint. The Metropolitan Police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 at 6,828 claims. However, young people and people from black or minority ethnic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.While instances of police brutality in the UK is comparatively less than its US counterpart, there are nonetheless high profile incidents that have received wide media coverage. Examples. In May 2013, 21-year-old Julian Cole was arrested outside a nightclub in Bedford by six police officers. The altercation left Cole in a vegetative state due to a severed spinal cord.

The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to \u20ac600 and as much as \u20ac30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers.

ACODI documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims feared police retaliation or believed their complaints would be ignored. This belief is not unfounded; in 2005, Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. Despite eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.Under Spanish law, the police have the right to check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern.

Racism. There have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal. In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism. According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001; however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.Racially-influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno Lopes was aggressively searched and physically abused. When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the Alfragide police station requesting information on Lopes' situation.

Numerous were critically wounded. Many Hong Kong citizens accuse the police of attempting to murder protesters to deter the people from exercising their freedom of expression.. Amnesty International released a report on 21 June 2019 denouncing the role of the Hong Kong police in the 12 June protest that ended up in bloodshed.Several street conflicts continued in Hong Kong throughout July 2019. Instances of police striking journalists with batons to obstruct their live reporting have been filmed.On the night of 31 August 2019, more than 200 riot police officers entered the Prince Edward MTR station and attacked suspects in a train compartment on the Tsuen Wan line with batons and pepper spray.

When investigations are made, they are often ineffective.The worst case of police brutality was the November 2012 protests; political dissatisfaction spurred a series of protests in Maribor, Slovenia. For the most part, the protests were peaceful; the crowds chanted and behaved non-violently for about two hours on 26 November 2012 (also known as, \"the second Maribor uprising\"). However, the violence began when crowds moved towards an area with a heavy police presence. Police used excessive force to disperse the crowds, including tear gas, dragging and beating protesters, police dogs, and mounted police who indiscriminately charged into the crowd. Civilians, protesters, and journalists were all targeted. Authorities attempted to justify the use of force by claiming protesters were violent and the use of force was necessary and not excessive. Slovenian media sources reported that the protest only turned violent after the police started using physical force. This level of violence was unprecedented and entirely unexpected in Slovenia.Since 2003, Slovenian authorities have attempted to rectify this discrimination by introducing a two-day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community. The programme involved teaching the police about Roma culture and their language which helped to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension. The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding the treatment of minorities. It also helped to build trust between the Roma community and the police. Tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme; however, they have been greatly reduced. Spain. With the beginning and spread of several mass movements of protests in 1968, including various regions and cities of Spain united against Francisco Franco's regime, the Francoist dictatorship of Spain repressed the protests and strikes in the country using police brutality and state violence.In post-Francoist Spain (1975\u2013present), two notable demonstrations were the ones that occurred in Barcelona on 27 May 2011, and in Madrid on 25 September 2012.

The police in Brazil have a history of violence against the lower classes. It dates back to the nineteenth century when it primarily served as an instrument to control slaves. In a mostly rural country, the police forces were heavily influenced by local large landowners known as \"colonels\".In the latter half of the twentieth century, the country was heavily urbanized, while over its last military dictatorship state governments became responsible for Brazilian police forces experiencing which became heavily militarized.The militarist approach to dealing with social issues led the country to its highest violence levels and in 2015 Brazil had more violent deaths than the Syrian Civil War, with most people fearing the police. More than 6,160 people were killed by the Brazilian police in 2018. In 2019, the state of Rio de Janeiro alone registered 1,814 killings by members of the police force in 2019, setting a new record. A significant portion of the officers involved had already been charged for crimes previously.Research released by the Forum Brasileiro de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica (Brazilian Public Security Forum) in partnership with S\u00e3o Paulo University showed that the Brazilian police killed approximately 6,416 people in 2020.

Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion. The PSNI has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease in the use of the baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used); however, harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland. Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's police force is called the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Garda) and employs around 14,500 staff. Ireland's criminal laws allow \"reasonable force\" to be used by the police with regard to all the circumstances, which eludes to officers actions being proportionate in the circumstances. Excessive use of force is unlawful, though section 76(7) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows the following considerations when deciding on what force is reasonable.. A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh up the exact necessary action at the time or may act instinctively but honestly \u2013 in these instances, the use of force may be considered reasonable.This is acknowledged by the Garda, who state: \"Unfortunately, even in the most civilised democratic jurisdictions, tragedies resulting from police use of force will continue to devastate families and communities\".The use of force by Irish Police officers has been of international concern, when the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported on this issue in the Republic three times within a decade. Incidents that prompted this concern centred around the death of John Carty, a man suffering from mental illness who was shot and killed by police; the prosecution of seven Garda police members due to assaults on protesters in 2002 and in 2005; and a fifteen-year-old boy who died after spending time in Garda custody. Given this state of events, the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections. Italy. The use of excessive violence by police officers has been a major concern in Italy since the 2000s."}]}, "correct": false}
