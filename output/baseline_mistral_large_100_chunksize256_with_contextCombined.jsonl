With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course.

In 1971, Picardo, after seeking inspiration in the buildings of Greece and New York which he claimed provided \"two basic architectural references: the classic perfection of the Parthenon and the constructive audacity of the new languages of New York\", Picardo's design won the competition and he was awarded the contract for the building.. Picardo designed a building of \"extreme simplicity and elegance, of great architectural beauty and modernity\".  Located between Calle de Castell\u00f3 and Calle de Padilla, the building, started in 1972, consisted of seven floors at ground level and above, measuring 1,400 square metres in all, and four below ground, measuring 3,000 square metres. Picardo's purpose in burying most of the building below ground was to obtain the maximum amount of free land for the garden. It was conceived as a cube with the same dimensions on each of the four fa\u00e7ades and designed with continuous horizontal banding without break around the corners.", "The oldest parts of the structure, a keep, a church and a cloister, date to the 12th and 13th centuries.The section of the property set aside for Picardo's conversion was the immense south wing, which was flanked by two towers and divided into three floors, the ground floor built of ashlar and the upper two floors of brick. There were balconies on the first floor, and on the uppermost floor a characteristic Aragonese long gallery had been developed, created by a succession of semi-circular arches. The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms.

Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction).

He designed classic Castilian-style furniture, flooring, rugs, doors, windows, light fittings, mirrors, heraldic displays, seigneurial crests, banners, explanatory mosaics and so on, everything down to the smallest detail. Picardo built 38 guest rooms and one suite on the first floor, and 42 rooms and one suite on the second floor, providing space for 162 guests.

He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior.

While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine F\u00edgaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco.

Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms.", "He surmounted it by constructing a patio rather than building on the fractured zone next to the cliff edge. This single deck was built as an independent structure separated from the main building, so that any future movement of the terrain would not effect the Parador itself.. Picardo's design of the Parador was a copy of a typical Andaluc\u00edan residence with an entrance hallway leading to a typical patio, open to the sky, with terracing supported by the seven reused columns (though one further column had to be made to copy the others so as to achieve the same number of columns on all four sides). There were further small secondary patios. The dining room and sitting room were positioned to take advantage of the widespread views to the south and southwest over and beyond the river.Throughout the building Picardo copied many Andaluc\u00edan architectural features, most particularly in the ceilings, using exposed pine wood joists, linked by vaulted plasterwork, and the floors which were terracotta throughout. As at Guadalupe and J\u00e1en, Picardo designed much of the interior furniture, fittings, lighting and decoration, copying many of the features, both large and small, he had used in the earlier projects.", "He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms.

On the north wall of the courtyard and approached from the outside by the barbican towers, Picardo installed the main reception area and rebuilt a portico area with pillars and intermediate glass. Above were bedrooms with balconied terraces erected in his signature timber style. He repeated the historical rendering of the exterior facades of the castle which had been decorated with sgraffito, and which he had removed, by replicating the decoration on the northern walls of the courtyard.In the northeast corner of the ground floor had been the bishops' throne room, and Picardo here installed the main guest lounge, a lofty room with a timber-beamed ceiling and two large fireplaces and chimneys. On the east side of the ground floor was the dining room, with the building's only large windows, which looked out onto the wooded ravine of the Arroyo Vadillo. The room used Picardo's favoured powerful stone vaulting to hide the steel supporting structure of the floor above.", "He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings. Picardo also installed a sgraffito image above the main doorway, featuring the cross of the Orden de Santiago (Order of Santiago).A new one-storey building was erected to the rear of the plot, imitating similar buildings in the city. Ashlar and solid brick formed the interior and exterior facings of the walls, and pantiles were utilised on the roofs. Picardo also excavated large areas beneath the buildings to make service areas. He designed and built a stone and iron enclosure and entrance gateway from the street to the patio garden. Throughout, his intention was to make the Hoster\u00eda appear, through imitation, to be an integral historic part of the old city centre.Internally, Picardo repeated many of his pastiche medievalisms as seen in his previous Parador projects, with much use of heavy timber, such as a dark coffered ceiling in the dining room and classic Castilian designs for windows, doors, furniture, and light fittings.", "Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle.", "The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style.

In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required..

It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret.", "There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition.

Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas.

There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations. With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition.

He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda.", "Despite these further works, the Parador has kept its original character as established by Picardo.

He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of M\u00e9rida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura.

Parador de Arcos de la Frontera: Casa del Corregidor. The Parador at Arcos de la Frontera in the province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda is located in the centre of the old town, at the top of the cliffs that overhang the Rio Guadalete. Picardo first visited the triangular site in February 1964.", "At that point the rest of the palace was, as Picardo had recommended, restored and converted and, with his original Hoster\u00eda, opened as a full Parador with 27 guest rooms on 10 October 1989. Picardo was not involved in this work.. Subsequent expansions into neighbouring buildings have turned the Parador into a much larger establishment. Picardo's original entrance, bar and cafeter\u00eda area now form a sumptuous suite, though the medieval aura of his interior decoration and furnishings for that part of the building has been lost through modernisation. Parador de Carmona: Alcazar del Rey Don Pedro. In 1966, while building the Parador at Arcos de la Frontera, Picardo was commissioned to inspect three ancient sites near the city of Sevilla in the province of the same name in Andaluc\u00eda with a view to constructing another Parador. After looking at the castle at Alcal\u00e1 de Guada\u00edra, and the palaces of \u00c9cija, he came across the ruined castle of Carmona the Alc\u00e1zar del Rey Don Pedro (also known as the Alc\u00e1zar de Arriba y Puerta de Marchena).", "In 1987 an expansion was carried out by the architect Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuenca G\u00f3mez which included additional guest rooms, and a new pavilion for conventions.

The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. It also reserved large areas for infrastructure, facilities and green spaces; among the latter, it emphasized the enclosure of the Collserola mountain range as a large central metropolitan park.Although it was not carried out in its entirety, various \"partial plans\" emerged from its initial approach, most of which yielded to the pressures of the land owners and tended towards the requalification of land: a 1971 study calculated a 1.8 multiplication of the population density of the partial plans with respect to the Comarcal of 1953.

Against the vision of the city as a unitary entity, the concept of the sum of realities was opposed, prioritizing attention to local needs. It sought to palliate both quantitative and qualitative deficits, in which each intervention in public space served as an engine of urban regeneration, compensating the peripheries with a \"monumentalization\" of their environment.One of the factors driving urban change was industrial restructuring, promoted by the Plan for the reindustrialization of the center of Barcelona, which resulted in the creation of an Zona d'Urgent Reindustrialitzaci\u00f3 (Urgent Reindustrialization Zone) (ZUR).", "The project included a region of Barcelona, which included the plain of the city, the Baix Llobregat and the group of towns around the Tibidabo mountain.

The city was still confined within its walls \u2014the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta\u2014 despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona's capital status meant that large-scale projects were not carried out. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed.", "Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530 000 inhabitants, in 1930 they had almost doubled (1 009 000 hab), to reach between 1970 and 1980 the maximum peak (1 754 900) and by the end of the century to 1 500 000 inhabitants.With the turn of the century, a new political scenario opened up, marked by the loss of the colonies in America and Asia and the rise of the Regionalist League, led by politicians such as Francesc Camb\u00f3, Enric Prat de la Riba and the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who expressed their desire to place Barcelona on the international front line, at the level of cities such as Paris, New York, Berlin or Vienna.

It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea.", "The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs.

This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory.

Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, under a project called the Eixample, drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 in 1859. After the revolution of 1868, the Citadel was also demolished and the land transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.Although chintz printing was well established in Barcelona since the 18th century, the industrial era proper began with the founding in 1832 of the Bonaplata Factory, founded by Josep Bonaplata. In 1849 the complex La Espa\u00f1a Industrial, owned by the Muntadas brothers, was opened in Sants.

The Cerd\u00e0 Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliaci\u00f3n, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Bes\u00f2s, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range.", "It is the model of the \"Imperial Barcelona\" proposed by Prat de la Riba, or the \"Nova Par\u00eds del Migdia\" (New Paris of the Midday) commented by Puig i Cadafalch.

Against the vision of the city as a unitary entity, the concept of the sum of realities was opposed, prioritizing attention to local needs. It sought to palliate both quantitative and qualitative deficits, in which each intervention in public space served as an engine of urban regeneration, compensating the peripheries with a \"monumentalization\" of their environment.One of the factors driving urban change was industrial restructuring, promoted by the Plan for the reindustrialization of the center of Barcelona, which resulted in the creation of an Zona d'Urgent Reindustrialitzaci\u00f3 (Urgent Reindustrialization Zone) (ZUR).", "The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. It also reserved large areas for infrastructure, facilities and green spaces; among the latter, it emphasized the enclosure of the Collserola mountain range as a large central metropolitan park.Although it was not carried out in its entirety, various \"partial plans\" emerged from its initial approach, most of which yielded to the pressures of the land owners and tended towards the requalification of land: a 1971 study calculated a 1.8 multiplication of the population density of the partial plans with respect to the Comarcal of 1953.

The integration of the new aggregated municipalities with Barcelona and between them was sought, with a predominance of the organizational aspects over the expansive ones, in an attempt to reformulate the Cerd\u00e0 Plan, badly seen by the modernist generation.

Among these layouts we must take into account the highways and rural roads, or the easements imposed by railroads, canals, irrigation ditches, torrents and other land features..

In 1922, the City Council created the Patronat Escolar, which promoted secular, bilingual education and pedagogical renovation, and promoted an ambitious plan of school buildings, including those built in noucentista style by Josep Goday (Ramon Llull, Collaso i Gil, Llu\u00eds Vives, Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals, Baixeras and Pere Vila schools).", "However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed V\u00eda Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport.

The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\".", "In addition, opponents opine that Macron has \"exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies\", and that \"the official body that monitors France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits\", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, \"were hard to accurately predict\".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France's political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him, having \"struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'\". He said that \"[t]hat's why he has not only all the unions, but also a large part of public opinion against him\", as \"[b]y tying himself to the project, opposition to it is heightened, dramatized in a way.\"It has been criticized for having taken place during a cost-of-living crisis, which some have attributed to worsening the anger and protests over the policies.", "In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that \"without immediate action\" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would \"balance the deficit\" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would \"pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early\".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030.", "This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\".

In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate's execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal.", "The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022.

Court of Appeal review. After the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's appeal for re-sentencing, Nagaenthran, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, filed two separate appeals to ask for the Court of Appeal to commute his sentence under the newly enacted death penalty laws, but the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on 27 May 2019. The Court of Appeal said that there were numerous inconsistencies in Nagaenthran's account of his crime, which made it hard to rely on his defence given that they affected his credibility. The five judges - Sundaresh Menon, Belinda Ang, Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, and Chao Hick Tin - held that Nagaenthran may have a low IQ, but his mental responsibility for his offence was not substantially impaired. He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently.. Besides, Nagaenthran had known that it was unlawful for him to import heroin, and hid the drugs to avoid detection.", "\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival.

They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted.", "Government's response. On the same day Nagaenthran was executed, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) made an official statement, in which they strongly condemned the allegations and rumours spread in relation to Nagaenthran's case, especially those seeking to \"cast aspersions\" on the involvement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, in which these rumours falsely suggested any form of bias made by Menon in his judgement in Nagaenthran's appeal. The AGC commented that the lawsuit against Menon was the seventh legal application (not including appeals) made on behalf of Nagaenthran, and they described the lawsuit as \"the latest attempt to abuse the court's processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran.\"The AGC also mentioned that prior to the lawsuit, it was specifically mentioned to Nagaenthran's counsel about Chief Justice Menon's appointment as the Attorney General during the prosecution of Nagaenthran, and Nagaenthran himself, under his lawyer's advice, made no objections for Menon to preside the lawsuit.", "Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion.

Therefore, for these above reasons, there was no basis at all in making the application.

He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila.

According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place.", "The AGC reiterated in a statement that Nagaenthran was given a fair trial and had \"exhausted his rights of appeal and almost every other recourse under the law over some 11 years\", while the CNB said in a separate statement that Nagaenthran's actions when committing the crime was \"a deliberate, purposeful and calculated decision\" and cited the related court findings, in which the judges all agreed that \"he knew what he was doing\" at the time of the offence.The CNB also said that there were too much misinformation spread about Nagaenthran's mental state, and they reiterated that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled at the time of his offence since he had tried to evade the authorities and also narrated too many inconsistent accounts of how and what led to him committing the offences.", "He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit.

Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a \"five-year-old child\", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, \"Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.", "He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently..

He was also prone to being manipulative and evasive, as shown from his initial attempts to avoid being searched before the narcotics officers arrested him in 2009. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was \"the working of a criminal mind\" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong.

It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor.", "Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth's researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. There is a record of market workers sending a wreath to the funeral of George Joseph Cooper MP, admired because at one time Argentina was put on the blacklist and he had tried very hard to get it removed.  In 1924, years after the market had closed, efforts were still being made to get it re-opened. Drovers.", "Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free.", "Trading was by private bargain, and in live animals only.

Despite this, it appears that most women tried to conceal their employment at the market. Deptford as an international livestock market. Over the years roughly half of London's meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on. From Europe. Early days. Describing the pull of London as a meat market for European farmers, Richard Peet said \"It was as though a city of several million people were located just off the Dutch coast\".", "Admiralty storehouses were converted into abattoirs, comprising some 70 slaughterhouses.The demise of the old naval dockyard was regretted by many, and some features dating to Henry VIII were preserved.

Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.

By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).", "Sometimes educated men e.g. Harvard students travelled as stiffs.  The poet W.H. Davies was a stiff and wrote about the harsh methods used to make the cattle stand up; so did an English solicitor returning from a working holiday to Canada.  It was done to stop animals tangling their head ropes, or being trampled to death by their fellows. Improvements. A government inquiry tended to confirm many of Plimsoll's allegations.  Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile.", "Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.", "She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.

Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)

Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.

Over the years roughly half of London's meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on. From Europe. Early days. Describing the pull of London as a meat market for European farmers, Richard Peet said \"It was as though a city of several million people were located just off the Dutch coast\".", "Trading was by private bargain, and in live animals only.  Exporters consigned cattle, sheep and pigs to salesmen who worked on commission.  Salesmen and buyers intermingled around the animal pens. Market days were Mondays and Thursdays, but there was nothing to stop animals being sold in their lairs on other days, and this was often done, especially when a shipload arrived late.. Weighbridges were seldom used: it was a matter of professional pride that cattle weights were guesstimated.  A journalist described it for Australian readers:The buyer runs over the lot, say, twenty or fifty, averaging the weights by calculation, and then offers a price, which is of course contemptuously rejected at first. By a gradual process of approximation the difficulty is got over, and a shake of the hand, or other mysterious sign, indicates the purchase of \u00a31000 worth of beef. The buyers were wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers, who had access to slaughterhouse space on the premises, generally renting it by the year.", "On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.

Significance to the West. The exportation of cattle to England had a discernible impact on the American livestock industry.  While not all American exports went to Deptford, London was the most important market.  Wrote John P. Huttman:The impact of foreign demand for U.S. meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds\".", "From Europe.

The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West.  But early Western cattle e.g. Texas longhorns, though hardy, made tough eating.  It cost exactly the same to ship a top quality steer from New York to London as a gristly one.  Consequently, it made economic sense for American shippers to export their best animals, as better able to absorb the cost of carriage. At first, export-grade cattle were to be found in the East only, where cattle breeds were similar to those of the British Isles.  British farmers were advised not to worry about imported Western livestock for the present, because it would not compete on quality.  But (as predicted) Western cattlemen realised they could capture lucrative markets by improving their stock \u2014 and did so.  The English export trade contributed to the demand for more and better cattle.Stockmen found profitable the exportation of only the choicest grade cattle and attained this quality by upgrading the range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood...  The trade therefore became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.   Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.", "In the 1860s the Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before they reached their port of embarkation. . Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.  The Russian capital was more than 30\u00b0 to the east of Deptford, and these animals may have come from much further still, since Saint Petersburg oblast raised few export-grade cattle.  They may have been driven to market from south Russia.  In 1872 the Russian Empire was blacklisted for cattle plague and no more Russian cattle could be landed, even at Deptford. Demise of European cattle trade. The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s \u2014 except for Iceland \u2014 after the British authorities faced the fact that too much livestock was really coming from places where disease was endemic \"and the provincial authorities made no attempt to stamp it out\".", "meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds\". As noted, the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.. Further, some British agriculturalists, shielded until recently from American competition \u2014 first by distance, then by quality issues \u2014 found it attractive to go in for American ranching themselves. They \"fought competition at its source and engaged directly in American ranching, until by 1884 it was estimated that 'one-sixth of all our herds are now owned by Englishmen'\".  And British investors, attracted by the fabulous profits sometimes realised in the West, made an important contribution to its development. From Canada. A major export industry at the time, range cattle came from Alberta and Assiniboia and went east on the Canadian Pacific Railway.

They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)

And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not \u2014 namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef.

When freights were high these vessels were hastily rigged up with temporary decks and crammed tightly with cattle.Risk was greatest in winter, when insurance rates soared to 10% \"as a heavy storm may make it necessary to lighten the ship by throwing the entire deck load of cattle overboard\".In 1879 the British government's chief veterinary officer reported on animals jettisoned from transatlantic cattle ships or dying on board from injury or suffocation.

Animals were sent from the grasslands of the world to be slaughtered at Deptford market.  Even today, when animal welfare is a consideration and the average journey from feedlot to slaughter plant lasts just a few hours, transport-related stress and injury are major sources of loss to the American meat industry.  According to Temple Grandin, fear, which motivates animals to avoid predators, is a very strong stressor during transport.  Animals unaccustomed to human beings are liable to be stressed more, and in that era of range cattle there were many.  An American special agent, reporting on the overseas shipping of untamed Argentine cattle (1904), said: The wild creatures wear themselves out trying to break away.  They are in  abject terror of everything near them, for they have never been restrained in any way before. Everything is new, and they do not understand that they will not be hurt, as the better trained animals do. They have never seen any dry food, and for days they do not eat. .

American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.

It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.", "She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.", "In Canada. There was no 28-hour law in Canada and rail journeys were immense. The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was \"sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer\", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain \"gaunt and shrunken\". Whether economic justification for live cattle trade. Plimsoll's case. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders.  He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not \u2014 namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade.", "Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters.", "Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently \u2014 as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it.", ". New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor.", "Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.", "Sometimes educated men e.g. Harvard students travelled as stiffs.  The poet W.H. Davies was a stiff and wrote about the harsh methods used to make the cattle stand up; so did an English solicitor returning from a working holiday to Canada.  It was done to stop animals tangling their head ropes, or being trampled to death by their fellows. Improvements. A government inquiry tended to confirm many of Plimsoll's allegations.  Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile."]}, "correct": true, "question_type": "comprehension_and_reasoning", "question_context": ["As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product)[194] was as good as, indeed\n\nwas better than Deptford-killed beef.

That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia's FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin's office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number.

Teacher shortages. In September 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order directing education officials in his administration to combat Virginia's teacher shortages by easing the process of gaining a teaching license in the state. The order aims to fill vacancies by focusing in large part on recruiting retired teachers, people whose teaching licenses have expired, people with out-of-state teaching licenses, college students in teacher training programs, and military veterans seeking to transition into teaching careers. The order also provides additional funding to school districts with the most severe teacher shortages in Virginia and seeks to bolster in-school child care options for teachers.The Washington Post reported that \"Youngkin\u2019s actions to loosen standards regarding who can become a teacher mirror efforts in other states, including Florida and Arizona, as the nation faces a catastrophic teacher shortage.\"", "According to The Washington Post, the \"centerpiece\" of this budget was \"a big increase in the standard deduction for personal income tax.\" Rather than doubling the standard deduction, as Youngkin had proposed, the budget increased it by about 80%, raising it from $4,500 to $8,000 for individuals and from $9,000 to $16,000 for couples filing jointly. The budget included one-time tax rebates and a partial elimination of Virginia's grocery tax, both of which aligned with Northam's own outgoing budget proposals rather than with Youngkin's preferred tax policies. As Northam had proposed, the one-time tax rebates amounted to $250 for individuals and $500 for couples, slightly less than Youngkin's desired $300 for individuals and $600 for couples, and although the final budget enacted Northam and Youngkin's shared goal of eliminating a 1.5% grocery tax that had been levied by the state, Democrats blocked Youngkin's additional proposal to eliminate a separate 1% grocery tax levied by Virginia localities.

This policy, designed to benefit low-income tax filers, was described by The Richmond-Times Dispatch as \"a longtime Democratic priority\" and had been opposed by Republicans. It was included in the budget as a compromise between the two parties.Youngkin's goal of offering relief from the state's gas tax was blocked by the legislature along mostly party lines. Democrats argued that the plan proposed by Youngkin would have deprived the state of revenue for transportation projects while offering insufficient relief to consumers. According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, it was estimated that about one-third of the savings from Youngkin's gas tax holiday proposal would have been kept by the oil industry, while about one-quarter of the savings would have gone to out-of-state drivers. Youngkin acknowledged that his proposal may not have resulted in significant savings for Virginians, saying, \"We can\u2019t guarantee anything\".", "Youngkin began offering specific proposals for education spending late in the summer of 2021, only a few months before the election. These proposals included $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.Youngkin inherited a record surplus in state revenue from Northam, which was projected to continue growing during the state's then-upcoming budget cycle. As a result of this surplus, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a biennial state budget in 2022 that committed $19.2 billion to education, a record for the state even when accounting for inflation. This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats. In exchange for getting much of their desired education spending enacted, Democrats agreed to enact several of Youngkin's tax cut proposals.Incorporated into the budget compromise was an outgoing proposal of Northam's to enact a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers.", "Upon their announcement, the Associated Press called these proposals \"the most wide-ranging and detailed look at the priorities of a potential Youngkin administration\". Had these proposals gone on to be enacted in full, they would have amounted to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts. During the campaign, Youngkin proposed paying for much of his proposed tax cuts with the state's budget surplus, which at the time, was projected to total $2.6 billion. Although The Washington Post and NPR both noted that much of that revenue would be unavailable for tax cuts, since state law required that over half of the amount be devoted to the state's \"rainy day\" reserve fund, water quality improvement fund, and transportation fund, Virginia's budget surplus continued to grow, and by the end of Northam's term, was projected to total at least $13.4 billion for the state's then-upcoming budget cycle.As his campaign's senior economic advisor, Youngkin hired Stephen Moore, who had helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas several years earlier when Sam Brownback was in office as that state's governor.", "Virginia was among the first states to receive such a grant, because, according to The Washington Post, its application to participate in the program had been one of the \"most thorough\".

Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. Although race blind, the reformed admissions processes achieved their goal by implementing an approach largely based on geographic and socioeconomic factors.

Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\".

According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.\n\nIn April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"\n\nAdditional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nOnly a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department.[285] The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental gr"]}

The quality and appearance of the luminous representation is in many cases linked to the technique used. The expression and the different light effects of a work depend to a great extent on the different techniques and materials used. In drawing, whether in pencil or charcoal, the effects of light are achieved through the black-white duality, where white is generally the color of the paper (there are colored pencils, but they produce little contrast, so they are not very suitable for chiaroscuro and light effects). Pencil is usually worked with line and hatching, or by means of blurred spots. Charcoal allows the use of gouache and chalk or white chalk to add touches of light, as well as sanguine or sepia. Another monochrome technique is Indian ink, which generates very violent chiaroscuro, without intermediate values, making it a very expressive medium.. Oil painting consists of dissolving the colors in an oily binder (linseed, walnut, almond or hazelnut oil; animal oils), adding turpentine to make it dry better. The oil painting is the one that best allows to value the light effects and the chromatic tones.", "In his treatise he established that \"painting is a composition of light and shadows, combined with the various qualities of all the simple and compound colors\". He also distinguished between illumination (lume) and brilliance (lustro), and warned that \"opaque bodies with hard and rough surface never generate luster in any illuminated part\".. The Florentine polymath included light among the main components of painting and pointed it out as an element that articulates pictorial representation and conditions the spatial structure and the volume and chromaticism of objects and figures. He was also concerned with the study of shadows and their effects, which he analyzed together with light in his treatise. He also distinguished between shadow (ombra) and darkness (tenebre), the former being an oscillation between light and darkness. He also studied nocturnal painting, for which he recommended the presence of fire as a means of illumination, and he wrote down the different necessary gradations of light and color according to the distance from the light source.", "Known since ancient Egypt, it has been a technique used throughout the ages, although with more intensity during the 18th and 19th centuries. As it is a wet technique, it provides great transparency, which highlights the luminous effect of the white color. Generally, the light tones are applied first, leaving spaces on the paper for the pure white; then the dark tones are applied.In acrylic paint, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents. The speed of drying allows the addition of multiple layers to correct defects and produces flat colors and glazes. Acrylic can be worked by gradient, blurred or contrasted, by flat spots or by filling the color, as in the oil technique. Genres. Depending on the pictorial genre, light has different considerations, since its incidence is different in interiors than in exteriors, on objects than on people. In interiors, light generally tends to create intimate environments, usually a type of indirect light filtered through doors or windows, or filtered by curtains or other elements.", "In general, the strongest contrasts were made in the areas closest to the observer and progressively reduced towards the background. This technique was picked up by early Christian and Byzantine art, as seen in the apsidal mosaic of Sant'Apollinare in Classe, and even reached as far as India, as denoted in the Buddhist murals of Ajant\u0101.In the 5th century the philosopher John Philoponus, in his commentary on Aristotle's Meteorology, outlined a theory on the subjective effect of light and shadow in painting, known today as \"Philoponus' rule\": If we apply black and white on the same surface and then look at them from a distance, the white will always appear much closer and the black much farther away. So when painters want something to look hollow, like a well, a cistern, a ditch or a cave, they paint it black or brown. But when they want something to appear prominent, such as a girl's breasts, an outstretched hand or a horse's legs, they apply black over the adjoining areas so that they appear to recede and the parts in between appear to come forward.. This effect was already known empirically by ancient painters.", "In the Flemish Gothic period, the technique of oil painting emerged, which provided brighter colors and allowed their gradation in different chromatic ranges, while facilitating greater detail in the details (Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, Gerard David).Between the 13th and 14th centuries a new sensibility towards a more naturalistic representation of reality emerged in Italy, which had as one of its contributing factors the study of a realistic light in the pictorial composition. In the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel (Padua), Giotto studied how to distinguish flat and curved surfaces by the presence or absence of gradients and how to distinguish the orientation of flat surfaces by three tones: lighter for horizontal surfaces, medium for frontal vertical surfaces and darker for receding vertical surfaces. Giotto was the first painter to represent sunlight, a type of soft, transparent illumination, but one that already served to model figures and enhance the quality of clothes and objects.", "The oil painting is the one that best allows to value the light effects and the chromatic tones. It is a technique that produces vivid colors and intense effects of brightness and brilliance, and allows a free and fresh stroke, as well as a great richness of textures. On the other hand, thanks to its long permanence in a fluid state, it allows for subsequent corrections.For its application, brushes, spatulas or scrapers can be used, allowing multiple textures, from thin layers and glazes to thick fillings, which produce a denser light.Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil of various mineral colors, with binders (kaolin, gypsum, gum arabic, fig latex, fish glue, candi sugar, etc.), kneaded with wax and Marseilles soap and cut into sticks. The color should be spread with a smudger, a cylinder of leather or paper used to smudge the color strokes. Pastel combines the qualities of drawing and painting, and brings freshness and spontaneity.Watercolor is a technique made with transparent pigments diluted in water, with binders such as gum arabic or honey, using the white of the paper itself.", "To this end, they used to paint outdoors (en plen air), capturing the various effects of light on the surrounding environment at different times of the day. They studied in depth the laws of optics and the physics of light and color. Their technique was based on loose brushstrokes and a combination of colors applied according to the viewer's vision, with a preponderance of contrast between elementary colors (yellow, red and blue) and their complements (orange, green and violet). In addition, they used to apply the pigment directly on the canvas, without mixing, thus achieving greater luminosity and brilliance.Impressionism perfected the capture of light by means of fragmented touches of color, a procedure that had already been used to a greater or lesser extent by artists such as Giorgione, Titian, Guardi and Vel\u00e1zquez (it is well known that the Impressionists admired the genius of Las Meninas, whom they considered \"the painter of painters\").", "Unlike in architecture and sculpture, where light is real, the light of the surrounding space, in painting light is represented, so it responds to the will of the artist both in its physical and aesthetic aspect. The painter determines the illumination of the painting, that is to say, the origin and incidence of the light, which marks the composition and expression of the image. In turn, the shadow provides solidity and volume, while it can generate dramatic effects of various kinds.In the pictorial representation of light it is essential to distinguish its nature (natural, artificial) and to establish its origin, intensity and chromatic quality. Natural light depends on various factors, such as the season of the year, the time of day (auroral, diurnal, twilight or nocturnal light \u2014 from the moon or stars) or the weather. Artificial light, on the other hand, differs according to its origin: a candle, a torch, a fluorescent, a lamp, neon lights, etc. As for the origin, it can be focused or act in a diffuse way, without a determined origin."]}, "correct": false, "question_type": "multiple_information_retrieval", "question_context": ["Oil painting consists of dissolving the colors in an oily binder (linseed, walnut, almond or hazelnut oil? animal oils), adding turpentine to make it dry better.", "Pastel painting is made with a pigment pencil of various mineral colors, with binders (kaolin, gypsum, gum arabic, fig latex, fish glue, candi sugar, etc.), kneaded with wax and Marseilles soap and cut into sticks.", "Watercolor is a technique made with transparent pigments diluted in water, with binders such as gum arabic or honey, using the white of the paper itself.", "In acrylic paint, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents."]}

This experimentation with light influenced the work of artists such as Veronese, Tintoretto, Jacopo Bassano and El Greco.Tintoretto liked to paint enclosed in his studio with the windows closed by the light of candles and torches, which is why his paintings are often called di notte e di fuoco (\"by night and fire\").

This was perhaps the first work to include artificial lighting with a naturalistic sense: the light radiating from the angel influences the illumination of the surrounding objects, while diluting the distant forms.. Outside Italy, Albrecht D\u00fcrer was especially concerned with light in his watercolor landscapes, treated with an almost topographical detail, in which he shows a special delicacy in the capture of light, with poetic effects that prelude the sentimental landscape of Romanticism.

On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice).", "In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself.

Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires..

In the Netherlands, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin sought to capture various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen, imitating the reflections of light on mirrors and metallic surfaces and highlighting the brilliance of colored jewels and gems (Triptych of M\u00e9rode, by Campin, 1425-1428; Polyptych of Ghent, by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, 1432).

Adam Elsheimer was noted for his light studies of landscape painting, with an interest in dawn and dusk lights, as well as night lighting and atmospheric effects such as mists and fogs.

Salomon van Ruysdael sought atmospheric capture, which he treated by tonalities, studying the light of different times of the day. His nephew Jacob van Ruysdael was endowed with a great sensitivity for natural vision, and his depressive character led him to elaborate images of great expressiveness, where the play of light and shadow accentuated the drama of the scene. His light is not the saturating and static light of the Renaissance, but a light in movement, perceptible in the effects of light and shadow in the clouds and their reflections in the plains, a light that led John Constable to formulate one of his lessons on art: \"remember that light and shadow never stand still\". His assistant was Meindert Hobbema, from whom he differed in his chromatic contrasts and lively light effects, which reveal a certain nervousness of stroke.", "He used to use a canvas as a reflecting or diffusing screen, which he regulated as he wished to obtain the desired illumination in each scene. His concern for light led him not only to his pictorial study, but also to establish the correct placement of his paintings for optimal visualization; thus, in 1639 he advised Constantijn Huygens on the placement of his painting Samson blinded by the Philistines: \"hang this painting where there is strong light, so that it can be seen from a certain distance, and thus it will have the best effect\". Rembrandt also masterfully captured light in his etchings, such as The Hundred Florins and The Three Crosses, in which light is almost the protagonist of the scene.. Rembrandt picked up the luminous tradition of the Venetian school, as did his compatriot Johannes Vermeer, although while the former stands out for his fantastic effects of light, the latter develops in his work a luminosity of great quality in the local tones. Vermeer imprinted his works \u2014 generally everyday scenes in interior spaces \u2014 with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres.", "In the Liberation of Saint Peter (1514, Vatican Museums, Vatican City) he painted a nocturnal scene in which the light radiating from the angel in the center stands out, giving a sensation of depth, while at the same time it is reflected in the breastplates of the guards, creating intense luminous effects.

In Scenes from the Life of Saint Nicholas (1437, Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) he applied Alberti's method of balancing illuminated and shaded halves, especially in the figure with his back turned and the mountainous background.. Uccello was also a great innovator in the field of pictorial lighting: in his works \u2014 such as The Battle of San Romano (1456, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) \u2014 each object is conceived independently, with its own lighting that defines its corporeality, in conjunction with the geometric values that determine its volume. These objects are grouped together in a scenographic composition, with a type of artificial lighting reminiscent of that of the performing arts..

The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti (\"Gerard of the Nights\"). In works such as Christ before the High Priest (1617), Nativity (1622), The Prodigal Son (1623) or The Procuress (1625), he showed great mastery in the use of artificial light, generally from candles, with one or two light sources that illuminated the scene unevenly, highlighting the most significant parts of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness.", "In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness.", "Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n developed a somewhat sweetened tenebrism, although one of his best works, San Hugo in the refectory of the Carthusian monks (c. 1630, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) stands out for the presence of white color, with a subtle play of light and shadow that stands out for the multiplicity of intensities applied to each figure and object.In Venice, Baroque painting did not produce such exceptional figures as in the Renaissance and Mannerism, but in the work of artists such as Domenico Fetti, Johann Liss, and Bernardo Strozzi one can perceive the vibrant luminism and the enveloping atmospheres so characteristic of Venetian painting.. The Caravaggist novelties had a special echo in Holland, where the so-called Caravaggist School of Utrecht emerged, a series of painters who assumed the description of reality and the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio as pictorial principles, on which they developed a new style based on tonal chromaticism and the search for new compositional schemes, resulting in a painting that stands out for its optical values.", "Its main representatives were Carlo Crivelli, Antonello da Messina, and Giovanni Bellini. In the Altarpiece of Saint Job (c. 1485, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), Bellini brought together for the first time the Florentine linear perspective with Venetian color, combining space and atmosphere, and made the most of the new oil technique initiated in Flanders, thus creating a new artistic language that was quickly imitated. According to Kenneth Clark, Bellini \"was born with the landscape painter's greatest gift: emotional sensitivity to light\". In his Christ on the Mount of Olives (1459, National Gallery, London) he made the effects of light the driving force of the painting, with a shadowy valley in which the rising sun peeks through the hills. This emotive light is also seen in his Resurrection at the Staatliche Museen in Berlin (1475-1479), where the figure of Jesus radiates a light that bathes the sleeping soldiers. While his early works are dominated by sunrises and sunsets, in his mature production he appreciates more the full light of day, in which the forms merge with the general atmosphere.", "With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome).", "This research gradually evolved into increasingly dramatic effects, giving more emphasis to artificial lighting, as seen in The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence (1558, Jesuit Church, Venice), where he combines the light of the torches and the fire of the grill where the saint is martyred with the supernatural effect of a powerful flash of divine light in the sky that is projected on the figure of the saint.

In El Greco's work, light always prevails over shadows, as a clear symbolism of the preeminence of faith over unbelief. In one of his first works from Toledo, the Expolio for the sacristy of the cathedral of Toledo (1577), a zenithal light illuminates the figure of Jesus, focusing on his face, which becomes the focus of light in the painting. In the Trinity of the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo (1577-1580) he introduced a dazzling Gloria light of an intense golden yellow. In The Martyrdom of Saint Maurice (1580-1582, Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial) he created two areas of differentiated light: the natural light that surrounds the earthly characters and that of the breaking of the glory in the sky, furrowed with angels."]}, "correct": true, "question_type": "comprehension_and_reasoning", "question_context": ["His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome).", "In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman.", "His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew.", "In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works? these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself.", "In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action.", "The Vocation of Saint Matthew(1601), by Caravaggio, Church of SanLuigi dei Francesi, Rome."]}

It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving \"an elevated style of landscape\" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting. He also painted biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component, as in his Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time.", "Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time. An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one. Church was Cole's first disciple, who transmitted to him his vision of a majestic and exuberant nature, which he reflected in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner, whose atmospheric effects are seen in works such as In the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D. C.), a lake between mountains seen after a storm, with the sun's rays breaking through the clouds. Heade was devoted to country landscapes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, in meadows of endless horizons with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day, sometimes refracted by humid atmospheres. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism.", "In his later works Clark states that \"Turner's imagination was capable of distilling, from light and color, poetry as delicate as Shelley's.\" Among his works are: San Giorgio Maggiore: At Dawn (1819, Tate Gallery), Regulus (1828, Tate Gallery), The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons (1835, Philadelphia Museum of Art), The Last Voyage of the \"Daredevil\" (1839, National Gallery), Negreros throwing the Dead and Dying Overboard (1840, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), Twilight over a Lake (1840, Tate Gallery), Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery), etc.. Mention should also be made of Richard Parkes Bonington, a prematurely deceased artist, primarily a watercolorist and lithographer, who lived most of his time in Paris. He had a light, clear and spontaneous style. His landscapes denote the same atmospheric sensibility of Constable and Turner, with a great delicacy in the treatment of light and color, to the point that he is considered a precursor of impressionism.", "His early works still had a certain classical component, in which he imitated the style of artists such as Claude Lorrain, Richard Wilson, Adriaen van de Velde or Aelbert Cuyp. They are works in which he still represents light by means of contrast, executed in oil; however, his watercolors already pointed to what would be his mature style, characterized by the rendering of color and light in movement, with a clear tonality achieved with a primary application of a film of mother-of-pearl paint. In 1819 he visited Italy, whose light inspired him and induced him to elaborate images where the forms were diluted in a misty luminosity, with pearly moonscapes and shades of yellow or scarlet. He then devoted himself to his most characteristic images, mainly coastal scenes in which he made a profound study of atmospheric phenomena. In Interior at Petworth (1830, British Museum, London) the basis of his design is already light and color, the rest is subordinated to these values. In his later works Clark states that \"Turner's imagination was capable of distilling, from light and color, poetry as delicate as Shelley's.\"", "C.), illuminated by a twilight that bathes the objects in contrast with the incipient darkness of the sky. In his work he uses flat and dense colors, in preferably nocturnal environments with special prominence of empty space, while objects and figures seem bathed in an unreal light, a light that seems to come from the stars, for which he felt a special devotion.In the United States, between the 1920s and 1930s, several figurative movements emerged, especially interested in everyday reality and life in cities, always associated with modern life and technological advances, including artificial lights in streets and avenues as well as commercial and indoor lights. The first of these movements was the Ashcan School, whose leader was Robert Henri, and where George Wesley Bellows and John French Sloan also stood out. In opposition to American Impressionism, these artists developed a style of cold tones and dark palette, with a theme centered on marginalization and the world of nightlife.", "Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism. Handicapped since childhood by polio, he focused on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon, in which light has a special role, a placid light that gives a sense of eternity, of time stopped in a serene perfection and harmony. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style.", "Constable once said that \"the form of an object is indifferent; light, shadow and perspective will always make it beautiful\".Joseph Mallord William Turner was a painter with a great intuition to capture the effects of light in nature, with environments that combine luminosity with atmospheric effects of great drama, as seen in Hannibal Crossing the Alps (1812, Tate Gallery, London). Turner had a predilection for violent atmospheric phenomena, such as storms, tidal waves, fog, rain, snow, or fire and spectacles of destruction, in landscapes in which he made numerous experiments on chromaticism and luminosity, which gave his works an aspect of great visual realism. His technique was based on a colored light that dissolved the forms in a space-color-light relationship that give his work an appearance of great modernity. According to Kenneth Clark, Turner \"was the one who raised the key of color so that his paintings not only represented light, but also symbolized the nature of light\". His early works still had a certain classical component, in which he imitated the style of artists such as Claude Lorrain, Richard Wilson, Adriaen van de Velde or Aelbert Cuyp.", "He was also influenced by John Constable, whose painting The Hay Wagon opened his eyes to a new sensitivity to light. In 1832 he traveled to Morocco, where he developed a new style that could be considered proto-impressionist, characterized by the use of white to highlight light effects, with a rapid execution technique. In the field of landscape painting, John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner stood out, heirs of the rich tradition of English landscape painting of the 18th century. Constable was a pioneer in capturing atmospheric phenomena. Kenneth Clark, in The Art of Landscape, credited him with the invention of the \"chiaroscuro of nature\", which would be expressed in two ways: on the one hand, the contrast of light and shade that for Constable would be essential in any landscape painting and, on the other, the sparkling effects of dew and breeze that the British painter was able to capture so masterfully on his canvases, with a technique of interrupted strokes and touches of pure white made with a palette knife."]}, "correct": true, "question_type": "comprehension_and_reasoning", "question_context": ["Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time."]}

Sorolla was a master at capturing the light in nature, as is evident in his seascapes, painted with a gradual palette of colors and a variable brushstroke, wider for specific shapes and smaller to capture the different effects of light. An interpreter of the Mediterranean sun like no other, a French critic said of him that \"never has a paintbrush contained so much sun\". After a period of training, in the 1890s he began to consolidate his style, based on a genre theme with a technique of rapid execution, preferably outdoors, with a thick brushstroke, energetic and impulsive, and with a constant concern for the capture of light, on which he did not cease to investigate its more subtle effects. La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind.", "Its main representatives were Vasili Perov, Iv\u00e1n Kramsk\u00f3i, Isaak Levit\u00e1n, and especially, Ili\u00e1 Repin.. In Spain, Carlos de Haes, Agust\u00edn Riancho and Joaqu\u00edn Vayreda deserve to be mentioned. Haes, of Belgian origin, traveled the entire Spanish geography to capture its landscapes, which he captured with an almost topographical detail. Riancho had a predilection for mountain scenery, with a coloring with a certain tendency to dark shades, free and spontaneous. Vayreda was the founder of the so-called Olot School. Influenced by the Barbizon School, he applied this style to the Girona landscape, with works of diaphanous and serene composition with a certain lyrical component of bucolic evocation.. Also in Spain it is worth mentioning the work of Mariano Fortuny, who found his personal style in Morocco as a chronicler of the African War (1859-1860), where he discovered the colorfulness and exoticism that would characterize his work.", "La vuelta de la pesca (1895) is the first work that shows a particular interest in the study of light, especially in its reverberation in the water and in the sails moved by the wind. It was followed by Pescadores valencianos (1895), Cosiendo la vela (1896) and Comiendo en la barca (1898). In 1900 he visited with Aureliano de Beruete the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was fascinated by the intense chromatism of the Nordic artists, such as Anders Zorn, Max Liebermann or Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer; From here he intensified his coloring and, especially, his luminosity, with a light that invaded the whole painting, emphasizing the blinding whites, as in J\u00e1vea (1900), Idilio (1900), Playa de Valencia (1902), in two versions, morning and sunset, Evening Sun (1903), The Three Sails (1903), Children at the Seashore (1903), Fisherman (1904), Summer (1904), The White Boat (1905), Bathing in J\u00e1vea (1905), etc.", "Between 1909 and 1910 his stays in Andalusia induced him to blur the contours, with a technique close to pointillism, with a predominance of white, pink, and mauve. Among his last works is La bata rosa (1916), in which he unleashes an abundance of light that filters through all parts of the canvas, highlighting the use of light and color on the treatment of the contours, which appear blurred.. The Luminist School of Sitges emerged in Catalonia, active in this town in the Garraf between 1878 and 1892. Its most prominent members were Arcadi Mas i Fondevila, Joaquim de Mir\u00f3, Joan Batlle i Amell, Antoni Almirall and Joan Roig i Soler. Opposed in a certain way to the Olot School, whose painters treated the landscape of the interior of Catalonia with a softer and more filtered light, the Sitgetan artists opted for the warm and vibrant Mediterranean light and the atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast.", "The former showed a special interest in highly complex lighting effects, such as the mixing of natural and artificial light. Gallen-Kallela was an original artist who later approached symbolism, with a personal expressive and stylized painting with a tendency towards romanticism, with a special interest in Finnish folklore. Zorn specialized in portraits, nudes and genre scenes, with a brilliant brushstroke of vibrant luminosity.. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin should be mentioned. Serov had a style similar to that of Manet or Renoir, with a taste for intense chromatism and light reflections, a bright light that extols the joy of life. Korovin painted both urban landscapes \u2014 Parisian street scenes \u2014 and natural landscapes \u2014 summer images in Crimea \u2014 in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art. In Spain, the work of Aureliano de Beruete and Dar\u00edo de Regoyos stands out. Beruete was a disciple of Carlos de Haes, so he was trained in the realist landscape, but assumed the impressionist technique after a period of training in France.", "Until the age of fifty he worked almost exclusively in charcoal drawing and lithography, although he later became an excellent colorist, both in oil and pastel. Puvis de Chavannes was an outstanding muralist, a procedure that suited him well to develop his preference for cold tones, which gave the appearance of fresco painting. His style was more serene and harmonious, with an allegorical theme evoking an idealized past, simple forms, rhythmic lines and a subjective coloring, far from naturalism. In France there was also the movement of the Nabis (\"prophets\" in Hebrew), formed by Paul S\u00e9rusier, \u00c9douard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis and F\u00e9lix Vallotton. This group was influenced by Gauguin's rhythmic scheme and stood out for an intense chromatism of strong expressiveness. Another focus of symbolism was Belgium, where the work of F\u00e9licien Rops, Fernand Khnopff and William Degouve de Nuncques should be noted. The first was a painter and graphic artist of great imagination, with a predilection for a theme centered on perversity and eroticism.", "Later his coloring became more intense, influenced by the divisionist technique, with a technique of superimposing brushstrokes in different tones; for the most illuminated areas he used yellow, orange and reddish tones, seeking a harmonious relationship between them all. After settling in Arles in Arles in 1888 he was fascinated by the limpid Mediterranean light and in his landscapes of that period he created clear and shining atmospheres, with hardly any chiaroscuro. As was usual in impressionism, he sometimes made several versions of the same motif at different times of the day to capture its light variations. He also continued his interest in artificial and nocturnal lights, as in Caf\u00e9 de noche, interior (1888, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), where the light of the lamps seems to vibrate thanks to the concentric halo-shaped circles with which he has reflected the radiation of the light; or Caf\u00e9 de noche, exterior (1888, Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo), where the luminosity of the caf\u00e9 terrace contrasts with the darkness of the sky, where the stars seem like flowers of light.", "Dal\u00ed's treatment of light is generally surprising, with singular fantastic effects, contrasts of light and shadow, backlighting and countershadows, always in continuous research of new and surprising effects. Towards 1948 he abandoned avant-gardism and returned to classicist painting, although interpreted in a personal and subjective way, in which he continues his incessant search for new pictorial effects, as in his \"atomic stage\" in which he seeks to capture reality through the principles of quantum physics. Among his last works stand out for their luminosity: Christ of Saint John of the Cross (1951, Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow), The Last Supper (1955, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C.), The Perpignan Station (1965, Museum Ludwig, Cologne) and Cosmic Athlete (1968, Zarzuela Palace, Madrid).. Joan Mir\u00f3 reflected in his works a light of magical and at the same time telluric aspect, rooted in the landscape of the countryside of Tarragona that was so dear to him, as is evident in La mas\u00eda (1921-1922, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.
