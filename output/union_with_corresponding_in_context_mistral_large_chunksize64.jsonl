Impact on physically demanding jobs: The reforms would raise the retirement age to 64 or 65, from 62, which could disproportionately affect those in physically demanding jobs.\n5. Perception of undemocratic process: The government's decision to force the bill through without a parliamentary vote has been criticized as undemocratic, further fueling opposition to the reforms.\n6.

Lack of clear calculations: The lack of clear calculations in the plan has been criticized, leading to concerns about its effectiveness and fairness.\n9. Political ramifications: The reforms have caused unease within the parties that Macron is aligned with or close to, and have been seen as a threat to his authority, further fueling opposition.\n10.

Oil painting: In this technique, light is represented by means of contrast, executed in oil.\n2. Acrylic painting: In this technique, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents.\n3. Pointillism: In this technique, there is no precise source of illumination, but each point is a light source in itself. The composition is based on juxtaposed (\"divided\") dots of a pure color, which merge in the eye of the viewer at a given distance.\n4. Glazing: The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke.\n5. Chiaroscuro: The interrelation between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\"; if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\".\n6. Colorism: The \"coloristic\" light can be by chiaroscuro (light and shadow) or by surface (a point of light that shines brighter than the rest); and the \"chromatic\", which can be tonal (contrast between two tones) or by saturation (a bright color with a neutral one).\n7. Luminism: In this technique, light is diffused from the background of the painting and, as it expands, it is enough by itself to create a sensation of depth, blurring the contours and degrading the colors to create the space of the painting.\n8. Impressionism: In this technique, artists painted from life, capturing at all times the variations of light on landscapes and objects, the fleeting \"impression\" of light at different times of the day.\n9. Fauvism: In this movement, a new conception of pictorial illumination arose, which consisted in the negation of shadows; the light comes from the colors themselves, which acquire an intense and radiant luminosity.\n10.
