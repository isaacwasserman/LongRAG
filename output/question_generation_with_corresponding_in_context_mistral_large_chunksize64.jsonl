{"question": "What techniques of painting are mentioned in pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used?", "ground_truth": "Four techniques are mentioned, including oil painting, pastel painting, watercolor, acrylic paint.", "generated_answer": " The techniques of painting mentioned in the pictorial representation of light when discussing different materials used are:\n\n1. Oil painting: In this technique, light is represented by means of contrast, executed in oil.\n2. Acrylic painting: In this technique, a plastic binder is added to the colorant, which produces a fast drying and is more resistant to corrosive agents.\n3. Pointillism: In this technique, there is no precise source of illumination, but each point is a light source in itself. The composition is based on juxtaposed (\"divided\") dots of a pure color, which merge in the eye of the viewer at a given distance.\n4. Glazing: The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke.\n5. Chiaroscuro: The interrelation between light and shadow is called \"chiaroscuro\"; if the dark area is larger than the illuminated one, it is called \"tenebrism\".\n6. Color stains: The artist applies color stains, especially red, to achieve a play of light and shadow.\n7. Negation of shadows: In this movement, a new conception of pictorial illumination arose, which consisted in the negation of shadows; the light comes from the colors themselves, which acquire an intense and radiant luminosity.\n8. Light and shadow interaction: For these artists, colors had to generate emotions, through a subjective chromatic range and brilliant workmanship. In this movement, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light.\n9. Structural light: With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements.\n10.
