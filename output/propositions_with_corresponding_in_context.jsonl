Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castell\u00f3n. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing \u2014 in particular his mastery of perspective \u2014 drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine F\u00edgaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Bolet\u00edn de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing \"increasing sophistication\" and being of \"complexity and extraordinary quality\". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of \u201cthe most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andaluc\u00eda for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career."}, {"summary_score": 0.8526752610341778, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.80594237671723, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "The five children of Picardo and Trinidad de Ribera Talavera include three boys and two girls.", "text": "Painted in 1953 it portrays Picardo in an informal pose at the age of 34.

The castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair and in some parts into ruin, but in 1925 it was declared a National Monument.When Picardo began work on the design he found that space in the palace was limited and he was unable to provide more than 12 guest rooms. His plan for the public areas included the conversion of two large and long ground floor interiors, with pointed barrel-vaulted ceilings, on each side of the building's entrance. To the left of the entry, in the original guardhouse, he placed the reception area and to the right, where the old stables were situated, he placed the bar and cafeter\u00eda, adding one single window to each space to allow in some daylight. In these rooms Picardo left the exposed masonry of the walls and ceilings. The main dining room, which he placed on the first floor, connected by the main staircase from the ground floor, was based on the great hall of a palace. In it he featured a large fireplace and chimney at one end, and used a multitude of large timber beams to shape a coffered ceiling, with decorative plasterwork strung below.. The twelve guest rooms were arranged on the second floor, but the windows being high in the walls, Picardo arranged for a raised area in front of each window so that guests could see out of the windows with greater ease. The public corridors followed the design pioneered by Picardo at Ja\u00e9n of imitation stone groin vaults at regular intervals.In planning the interior decoration Picardo determined that the ground floor would be medieval in design in keeping with the original military use of the palace, and the upper floors would be more palatial in decor. He designed much of the joinery, the beds, the tables, the chairs and, in particular, the light fittings, making use of the emblem of the Order of Calatrava as a decorative motif. His attention to detail even extended to the design of hinges and handles for doors, and for the heads of nails used in the door faces. He also made considerable use of his characteristic ceramic murals decorating the public parts of the building, including his history of the castle, all produced by his favoured ceramicist, Juan Manuel Arroyo, and signed by Picardo.The Parador opened for service on 18 May 1968 and was inaugurated on 6 July 1968.As early as 1972 Picardo had reported to the Ministry of Information and Tourism on the feasibility of carrying out further work to increase the number of rooms at Alca\u00f1iz. In 1975 he designed a new two-storey wing for the ruined west side of the complex which would double the number of guests rooms. His plans lay in abeyance until 1998 when the architect Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuenca G\u00f3mez resurrected Picardo's original 1975 designs. They had to be altered somewhat in the light of archeological discoveries made since 1975, but much of Picardo's ideas were incorporated in the expansion of the Parador, bringing the number of guest rooms to 38. Hoster\u00eda de C\u00e1ceres: El Comendador. In 1966 Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to work on the Palacio del Comendador de Alc\u00faescar (Commander's Palace of Alc\u00faescar), also known as the Palacio de los Marqueses de Torre Orgaz, in the historic centre of C\u00e1ceres in the province of the same name in Extremadura. Originally built as a medieval fortified residence on pre-existing Arab buildings in 1488, the palace was modified in later centuries, adding Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. The Ministry proposed the conversion of one part of the palace into a Hoster\u00eda.The part of the building on which Picardo was to work was a jumble of old buildings, some attached to the main palace building and some free-standing, which had mostly formed stables and coach houses. There was also a patio-garden between these buildings and the palace and its tower.. Picardo began by demolishing most of the ramshackle service buildings, other than the square structure at Number 6 Calle Ancha which benefitted from substantial stone walls and four brick, groined vaults. Picardo decided the lower ground floor of this building would form the bar and cafeter\u00eda, with a doorway from the street which would become the main entrance to the Hoster\u00eda. He erected three further floors above the lower-ground floor, reusing many architectural elements from the demolished buildings."}, {"summary_score": 0.886515628940864, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.903276072350055, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views.", "text": "He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains.

Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience.

In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of M\u00e9rida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monz\u00f3n, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Catalu\u00f1a and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Catalu\u00f1a.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Ant\u00f3n at A Coru\u00f1a in 1968, the Posada del Cord\u00f3n at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del De\u00e1n and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia. Also in 1971 Picardo inspected the castle at Molina de Arag\u00f3n in the province of Guadalajara, and possibly also in 1971 the Castillo de Valderrobres in Teruel in Aragon. In 1972 he surveyed the castle at Trujillo in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, the cave houses of Mes\u00f3n Gitano (now known as the yacimiento arqueol\u00f3gico Barrio Almohad\u00ed (archeological site Barrio Almohad\u00ed) and the nearby Alcazaba of Almer\u00eda, and the castle-fortress at Aracena in the Province of Huelva in Andaluc\u00eda. In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Controversial legacy of Picardo's Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out.

With a number he returned to build additions to his earlier work. He also worked on a number of other Parador projects which for various reasons did not reach fruition. His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbar\u00e1n. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gram\u00e1tica, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Cat\u00e1logo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de inter\u00e9s nacional hist\u00f3rico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an \"outstanding\" staircase, and to return them to their original Mud\u00e9jar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mud\u00e9jar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina.

Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of \u201cthe most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andaluc\u00eda for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career. Its influence, particularly in his work on Paradores, can be clearly seen.. During the 1950s Picardo pursued his personal architectural ambitions, entering competitions and publishing plans and drawings of uncommissioned buildings. In 1951 in  company with his fellow architect Carlos de Miguel he designed a centre for the Cofrad\u00eda de Pescadores (Fishermen's Brotherhood) of Altea in the province of Alicante which attracted much attention but remained unbuilt.Picardo, working alone, designed a small hotel which could be built on the Costa del Sol in Andaluc\u00eda. He described it as \"un modesto parador (a modest inn), resolved in a simple and attractive way\".In competition, Picardo entered plans and drawings of a preliminary draft for the Delegaci\u00f3n de Hacienda de Gerona (Treasury Delegation in Gerona) but came second behind the Spanish architect Carlos Sobrini who had been a year behind Picardo at college. He also came second in a similar competition a year later with a design for the Delegaci\u00f3n de Hacienda en Las Palmas (Treasury Delegation in Las Palmas), once again losing to Carlos Sobrini.In 1958 Picardo co-designed with his brother Carlos Picardo a six-storey edificio de viviendas (apartment building) near Madrid's Plaza de Las Ventas, designed for middle-class families.In the early 1960s Picardo built some houses in the vernacular and historical Andaluc\u00edan style on the Costa del Sol and in Jerez and, in contrast, a number of modernist apartment blocks for the construction company Urbis in Madrid. He also moved on to a series of building commissions for the Spanish Ministerio de Informaci\u00f3n y Turismo (Ministry of Information and Tourism) which laid the foundation for his notable work in the 1960s and 1970s on a large number of the state-owned luxury hotel network Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a.. Even early in his architectural career, Picardo was viewed as a supreme draughtsman, producing quick sketches, perspectives, views, details and innumerable plans of his projects in which his skills can be easily identified. Artist. As well as his work on modern buildings and on preservation and restoration projects through the 1950s, Picardo continued to receive commissions for decorative mural paintings, where he \"demonstrated his mastery in the use of colour and techniques such as watercolour and oil\". His works were seen in locations such as the new Hotel de Los Cisnes in Jerez, while in Madrid he embellished the Bar Jerez, the Hotel Plaza, the Residencia de Ingenieros del Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n (Engineers' residence of the National Institute of Colonization), the Exposici\u00f3n de Regiones Devastadas (Exposition of Devastated Regions), the Instituto de \u00d3ptica \"Daza de Vald\u00e9s\" (Institute of Optics), the sales area of the Garaje Villamagna (Villamagna Garage) and in 1953 he completed extensive paintings at the Restaurante Commodore in Madrid where amongst other images he produced two large curved panoramic views, one of Madrid and one of C\u00e1diz. Picardo was regarded as an \"outstanding\" muralist.At the same time his drawings of buildings and architectural details were published as illustrations in a best-selling textbook on monumental and historic Spanish architecture, Arquitectura Popular Espa\u00f1ola, by the restoration and conservation architect Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s. Picardo travelled around Spain with him, making a multitude of detailed drawings of vernacular architectural elements for Balb\u00e1s' books.. Picardo's published architectural drawings were highly regarded. They were described as \"magnificent\" by the leading Spanish restoration architect Luis Men\u00e9ndez-Pidal y \u00c1lvarez.In 1959 Picardo was given an unusual commission: to design a pack of baraja de naipes (playing cards) for exclusive use as advertising material by the Spanish fashion brand Loewe."}, {"summary_score": 0.8543350599101338, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7784889871627639, "text_rank": 17, "proposition": "Picardo", "text": "The architects' problem was that, while the painting is 7.76 metres long by 3.49 metres high, the largest sheet of 18mm triple armoured glass available at that time was smaller, at 7.50 metres by 2.45 metres. The decision was therefore made to install the painting some distance away from the main sheet of glass, so that the metal frame of the glass would not infringe on the view of the image. The solution for the display was to build an armoured glass and steel polyhedron case whose bevels, for full security, would meet the floor, the walls and the ceiling around the picture. The main glass itself was set at 10 degrees to the vertical to avoid reflections. The sources of illumination would be within the case. The size of the room in which the picture was displayed \u2014 a large high space originally created as a ballroom \u2014 allowed the whole canvas to be viewed from 25 metres away.Guernica was installed in September 1981 and the room opened to the public on 25 October that year, Picasso's centenary. Within a year, over one million people had seen Guernica in its new Picardo/de Paredes setting. Opinions of the method of display differed. The artist's daughter, Paloma Picasso, applauded the location and the method of display, as did Spanish artist Josep Renau. Catalan architect, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, described it as \"magnificent\". The British art critic and collector, Douglas Cooper, wrote that the painting was \"admirably lit, there being no shadows, no reflections and no distortions.\" He went on: \"Never in its history has Guernica been displayed so beautifully or so entirely to its advantage.\" Others were not so convinced. It was reported that the fact the installation was built by the technicians of the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes rather than by the Prado's own staff brought practical difficulties. And British art critic, David Sylvester, maintained years later that when Guernica was returned to Spain in 1981 \"it was hung in an annexe to the Prado, where by common consent it was not seen to advantage.\"In 1992 Guernica was controversially moved from the Museo Nacional del Prado (where Picasso had wanted the painting to be permanently displayed) to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. The Picardo/Garc\u00eda de Paredes display installation is no longer in use. Election to the Real Academia. On 3 February 1997, at the age of 78, Picardo was elected Academician of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), being proposed by Julio Cano Lasso, Fernando Chueca Goitia and Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. He entered the Academy on 22 February 1998 with a speech entitled Hip\u00f3lito, the composition and delivering of an address having been established as one of the requirements after being elected Academician. In it he talked of two of his passions: architecture and the horse. \"The horse is an animal that surpasses the human body in beauty, strength and speed,\" Picardo claimed. \"... and architecture, in turn, is the art that protects this human body and enables and exalts it.\" He confessed that it was impossible for him to decide between architectural beauty and equine beauty because both \"son perfecciones\" (are perfections).In 2000 Picardo gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores, an image of five policemen mounted on five horses in a compact group. The academy observes the complicated juego (game) of the twenty horses' legs of different colours and in different positions seemingly almost entwined.The academy also houses in its collection a portrait of Picardo by Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. Painted in 1953 it portrays Picardo in an informal pose at the age of 34. It was donated to the academy by his sons in 2023. Premio Antonio Camu\u00f1as de Arquitectura. In 2001 Picardo won the prestigious Premio Antonio Camu\u00f1as de Arquitectura (Antonio Camu\u00f1as Prize for Architecture). The prize has been awarded every two years since 1985. Its purpose is to recognise the oeuvre of a Spanish architect who has stood out in his or her work for architectural renovation.

It was an agricultural area and summer residences, which received numerous immigrants, especially in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. Being a peripheral area, it has a low population density, with a predominance of young and lower-middle class population. During the years of massive immigration, it was an area of strong real estate speculation.. Nou Barris (8.04 km\u00b2, 164,516 inhabitants): is the most recently created district, on land segregated from Sant Andreu de Palomar. It is a peripheral area with a majority immigrant population, which also suffered from strong real estate speculation and even suffered from shantyism and self-construction, and which for a long time has suffered from a significant lack of assistance, infrastructure and basic services, which have been mitigated in recent times. The majority of the population is working class and has low purchasing power.. Sant Andreu (6.56 km\u00b2, 145,983 inhabitants): corresponds to the former municipality of Sant Andreu de Palomar, annexed in 1897. It was an agricultural and milling area until the mid-nineteenth century, when numerous industries began to settle. On the other hand, in the mid-twentieth century it received a strong wave of immigration, which was received in neighborhoods of cheap houses and residential estates, such as the Bon Pastor and Bar\u00f3 de Viver. In recent times it has experienced a certain revitalization thanks to commercial activities such as the location of the La Maquinista center or the urbanization of the surroundings of La Sagrera Station to accommodate the arrival of the AVE high-speed train.. Sant Mart\u00ed (10.80 km\u00b2, 232,629 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Sant Mart\u00ed de Proven\u00e7als, added in 1897. Like the previous one, it was an agricultural and milling area, until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution when numerous factories were installed in the area; however, in recent decades it has suffered a process of deindustrialization, replaced by economic activities more based on new technologies, especially after the location of the so-called 22@ district. This district also welcomed a large immigrant population. Thanks to the 1992 Olympic Games, it underwent a process of renovation of the entire waterfront, where the Olympic Village was located. Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla\u00e7a del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts."}, {"summary_score": 0.8732427893672353, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8833318928245495, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "Barcelona is divided into 10 districts and 73 neighborhoods.", "text": "Administrative divisions.

This area received much immigration from the rest of Spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, settled mainly in the neighborhoods of Sant Pere and Raval; it has continued to do so during the twenty-first century, although with immigrants from other countries. This district has the oldest and lowest socioeconomic level population in the city, although in the new millennium a slow process of gentrification has begun in parallel to the urban development plans carried out in the district. Being the oldest part of the city, it has numerous monuments and architectural works of interest, making it an important focus of tourist attraction. On the other hand, it houses the most important institutions of the city, such as the City Hall or the Generalitat de Catalunya.. Eixample (7.46 km\u00b2, 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerd\u00e1 Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands.. Sants-Montju\u00efc (21.35 km\u00b2, 180,824 inhabitants): includes the old town of Sants, annexed to Barcelona in 1897, together with the land of Montju\u00efc mountain, which makes it the largest district of the city; it also includes the Zona Franca. It has a low population density, and its rate of population of foreign origin exceeds the average. It has a high percentage of green area, thanks mainly to the presence of the Montjuic mountain, as well as industrial land.. Les Corts (6.08 km\u00b2, 81,200 inhabitants): it comes from the old town of Les Corts de Sarri\u00e0, added to the city in 1897, with a probable origin in a medieval masia. It was an eminently agricultural area, which in the mid-nineteenth century experienced a significant urban growth with the construction of the area called Corts Noves. The population is mainly autochthonous, and stands out for its high rate of young people. The majority is middle class, although the Pedralbes neighborhood stands out as one of the most exclusive in the city. Its main economic activity is in the tertiary sector, and it is home to numerous financial institutions and office centers.. Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi (20.09 km\u00b2, 145,761 inhabitants): it comes from the union of two former municipalities, Sarri\u00e0 and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles. It is one of the largest districts, especially because it includes a large part of the Collserola mountain range. It is also the district with the lowest population density, mainly because it is a high status residential area, with a predominance of single-family houses. The economy is dominated by quality facilities, as well as private schools and health centers. Its population has the highest rate of higher education and technical and managerial professionals, as well as autochthonous residents, while the foreign population is dominated by the European Union.. Gr\u00e0cia (4.19 km\u00b2, 120,273 inhabitants): has its origins in the old village of Gr\u00e0cia, incorporated into the city in 1897.

The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte.

The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea. The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km\u00b2. The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montju\u00efc; those of Martorell and Castellv\u00ed de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Erampruny\u00e0 (Gav\u00e0) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Bes\u00f2s river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10\u201312 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent \u2014later City Hall\u2014 or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital \u2014such as the Santa Creu\u2014 or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the B\u00f2ria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Pla\u00e7a Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara \u2014in the current Citadel Park\u2014, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marqu\u00e8s del l'Argentera. Currently only the Portal de Santa Madrona, in the Drassanes, is still preserved.With the extension of the wall, a long avenue known as La Rambla, occupied mainly by religious institutions, was left within the city walls. It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc."}, {"summary_score": 0.8573069520415078, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7853940324508858, "text_rank": null, "proposition": "Eixample arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls.", "text": "Administrative divisions.

Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire. This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs.

At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea."}]}, "correct": false}

The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea."}, {"summary_score": 0.8545157643926875, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8481769335729561, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "In the Early Modern Age, Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy.", "text": "It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc. Early Modern Age. In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry. The city was still confined within its walls \u2014the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta\u2014 despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona's capital status meant that large-scale projects were not carried out. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Pla\u00e7a de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montju\u00efc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area."}]}, "correct": false}

On the other hand, there was a campaign to restore facades and monuments and to adapt dividing walls, called Barcelona posa't guapa (Barcelona make yourself pretty) (1986-1992), directed by Josep Emili Hern\u00e1ndez-Cros, from the Heritage area of the City Council.The celebration of the Games was a challenge for the urban planning of the city, and was a platform for a determined strategic urban planning action, with a perfect harmony between social and economic agents, which led to a new projection of the city both nationally and internationally, and led to talk of a \"Barcelona model\" as an integrative project of urban reform that was exportable to other cities.The last years of the century were marked by the search for a more sustainable urban planning based on ecological criteria. This new awareness was reflected in the search for public spaces adapted to the environment and designed for the residents, with special emphasis on community facilities and services. These criteria were defined in particular at the Sustainable Barcelona Civic Forum, held in 1998. One of the main achievements during these years in the interests of sustainability has been the commitment to the bicycle as a more environmentally friendly means of transport: in 1993 the first bicycle path was installed on Avinguda Diagonal, on a 3 km stretch; since then the space allocated to bicycles has not stopped increasing, the use of which has also been favored by the creation in 2007 of a municipal bicycle rental company (Bicing), with several stopping points throughout the city.The turn of the century also saw an increase in multi-municipal projects, especially in terms of infrastructure and transport, such as the expansion of the port and the airport, the route of the AVE and the Plan for public transport, or the projects for the rehabilitation of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f3s deltas. The Pla Director d'Infraestructures (Infrastructure Master Plan) (PDI) marked the expansion and improvement of public transport, with a Metro network covering the entire metropolitan area, the reintroduction of the tramway at both ends of the Diagonal (Baix Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s), and the improvement of the bus network. 21st Century. With the turn of the century, the city continued to focus on innovation and design as projects for the future, together with the use of new technologies and a commitment to environmental sustainability. In 2000, the Urban Strategies Advisory Council was created to assist the City Council in urban planning and strategic decision making for the city and its surroundings. Initially it was composed of Oriol Bohigas, Dominique Perrault, Richard Rogers, Ramon Folch, Jordi Nadal and Antoni Mar\u00ed.One of the first urban development projects of the new millennium was the creation of the 22@ district, thanks to a modification of the General Metropolitan Plan in 2000. Its objective is the reformulation of the industrial land in the El Poblenou neighborhood, a traditionally industrial sector that fell into decline at the end of the 20th century due to the relocation of most companies to land outside the city. The preservation of the productive business fabric of the area was then promoted, focusing on companies dedicated to new technologies, in line with the private sector and the day-to-day activities of the area. The area of action is 115 ha, which made it one of the areas of greatest urban renewal in Europe at the beginning of the 21st century.. One of the most outstanding events of the new millennium was the celebration of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures, which led to new urban changes in the city: the entire Bes\u00f2s area, until then populated by old disused factories, was recovered, the entire Poblenou neighborhood was regenerated and the new Diagonal Mar neighborhood was built, while the city was provided with new parks and spaces for the leisure of the citizens."}, {"summary_score": 0.8653828359069924, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8711096492416152, "text_rank": 2, "proposition": "During the Middle Ages, an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona.

In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc. Early Modern Age. In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry. The city was still confined within its walls \u2014the only expansion was on the beach, in the neighborhood of La Barceloneta\u2014 despite the fact that by the end of the period it had almost 100,000 inhabitants.This period was not one of excessive urban reforms, since the loss of Barcelona's capital status meant that large-scale projects were not carried out. In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Pla\u00e7a de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montju\u00efc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area."}]}, "correct": false}

In 1922, city buses were reestablished, in charge of the Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Autobuses de Barcelona (General Bus Company of Barcelona, CGA), which was later absorbed by Tranv\u00edas de Barcelona, (Tramways of Barcelona) which went on to operate both transports.Also at this time the first taxis appeared: in 1910 the first 21 vehicles were licensed; in 1920 there were already a thousand taxis, with 64 stops throughout the city. In 1928 the green light was incorporated as a \"free\" signal, and in 1931 the color black and yellow was established as the city's distinguishing color.. In the 1920s, urban transport was improved with the construction of the Barcelona Metro. Work began in 1920 with the installation of two lines: line 3 (Lesseps-Liceo), inaugurated in 1924, and line 1 (Catalu\u00f1a-Bordeta), put into service in 1926. The network was progressively expanded, and today Barcelona has 12 lines. Initially it was operated by three companies: Gran Metropolitano de Barcelona (L3), Metropolitano Transversal (L1) and Ferrocarril de Sarri\u00e0 a Barcelona (now Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya); the first two merged in 1957 into the company Ferrocarril Metropolitano de Barcelona, which together with the bus company Transportes de Barcelona formed in 1979 the company Transportes Metropolitanos de Barcelona (TMB).It should also be noted that during the first decades of the century, public schooling was greatly boosted, thanks above all to the initiative of the City Council, the Provincial Deputation and the Commonwealth of Catalonia. In 1922, the City Council created the Patronat Escolar, which promoted secular, bilingual education and pedagogical renovation, and promoted an ambitious plan of school buildings, including those built in noucentista style by Josep Goday (Ramon Llull, Collaso i Gil, Llu\u00eds Vives, Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals, Baixeras and Pere Vila schools). After the Civil War, public education was taken over by the central government, until the arrival of democracy, when the competences were transferred to the Generalitat.In these years, increasing importance was also given to the question of green spaces, which was raised in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubi\u00f3 i Tudur\u00ed, director of the Parks and Gardens Service of Barcelona: with the text El problema de los espacios libres (The problem of open spaces), presented at the XI Congreso Nacional de Arquitectos (XI National Congress of Architects), he proposed the placement of a series of green spaces in the form of concentric semicircles between the Bes\u00f2s and Llobregat rivers, all along the Collserola mountain range, with small enclaves in the inner part of the city in the style of the London squares. He proposed four levels for the city: interior parks, among which would be the Citadel and Montju\u00efc, as well as three smaller ones (Letamendi, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and Gl\u00f2ries); suburban parks, among which would be the Hippodrome, Tur\u00f3 Park, Tur\u00f3 Gil, Font del Rac\u00f3, Vallcarca, Guinard\u00f3 and Park G\u00fcell; exterior parks (Llobregat, Pedralbes, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo, Sant Medir, Horta and Bes\u00f2s); and the Collserola nature reserve. Rubi\u00f3's project was not executed, except in small portions, but little by little the city was gaining green land: from 1910 to 1924 it went from 72 ha to 450 ha. 1929 International Exposition. In 1929 the International Exposition was held in Montju\u00efc. For this event the entire area of the Pla\u00e7a dEspanya, the avenue of Queen Maria Christina and the mountain of Montju\u00efc was urbanized, and the pavilions that currently house the Barcelona Fair were built. One of the main architects of the project was Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and it was one of the main test beds of noucentisme, the successor style to modernisme."}, {"summary_score": 0.895540442987443, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8632610732981968, "text_rank": 5, "proposition": "Streetcars in Barcelona were replaced by buses.

In transportation, streetcars were replaced by buses, and the metro network was expanded; in 1941 trolleybuses appeared, which disappeared in 1968. The water supply was also improved with the contribution coming from the Ter River, natural gas was introduced, and the electrical and telephone networks were renewed.In 1952 Barcelona hosted the XXXV International Eucharistic Congress, which allowed the development of a new neighborhood known as Congreso (Congr\u00e9s), with a housing complex designed by Josep Soteras, Carles Marqu\u00e8s and Antoni Pineda. The complex, of 16.5 ha, included a complex of 3,000 homes, 300 commercial premises, a church (parish of San P\u00edo X) and various school, sports and cultural services and facilities, with alternating open and closed blocks. In the rest of the city, several renovations were also carried out, such as the opening of the avenues of Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias (now Riera de Cassoles) and Infanta Carlota (now Josep Tarradellas); a monumental fountain was placed at the intersection of Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the work of Josep Soteras; and Calvo Sotelo square \u2014currently Francesc Maci\u00e0\u2014 was landscaped, with a project by Nicolau Maria Rubi\u00f3 i Tudur\u00ed.In 1957 the first section of the Paseo Mar\u00edtimo was opened, an idea that had emerged in the 1920s but had not yet been developed, with a project by Enric Giralt i Ortet. On the other hand, the housing deficit to accommodate the new immigration led to the enactment of the Social Urgency Plan of 1958, which led to the construction of large blocks of social housing in neighborhoods on the periphery, such as La Verneda, Torre Llobeta, La Trinitat and Verdum.. The Zona Franca, an industrial sector located between the mountain of Montjuic, the port and the Llobregat, was also established at that time. The idea arose in 1900, due to the loss of the colonial market in Cuba, promoted by Fomento del Trabajo Nacional (National Labor Development) an entity that commissioned the project to Guillem Graell. However, bureaucratic obstacles, the outline of several projects that did not come to fruition and the Civil War delayed its construction until the 1960s, although then simply as an industrial estate, abandoning the concept of a zona franca. In addition to the industrial area itself, several residential neighborhoods were located in the sector, such as Casa Ant\u00fanez, Can Clos, La Vinya and Polvor\u00edn. In 1967, Mercabarna, a central wholesale food market that supplies the entire city, was established in the area. In 1993 the Zona d'Actividades Log\u00edsticas (Logistics Activities Zone) (ZAL), dedicated to post-production and pre-commercial activities, was also created in the area.Between 1957 and 1973, Josep Maria de Porcioles was mayor, a long term of office known as the \"Porcioles era\", which stood out in urban planning for its speculative rampage, favored by the Municipal Charter of 1960, which granted the City Council broad powers in many areas, including urban planning. Porcioles created the Municipal Housing Board, whose developments included the creation of large housing estates, such as Montbau (1958-1961), Southwest Bes\u00f2s (1959-1960) and Canyelles (1974). Some of the urban development actions of this period were positive, such as the covering of Arag\u00f3n street, the extension of the Gran V\u00eda towards the Maresme, the adaptation of the seafront of Montjuic or the Barceloneta promenade; however, the speculative rampage of large real estate operations generated popular discontent that resulted in the so-called \"urban social movements\", which combined the discomfort generated by the degradation of the urban periphery with political protest against the Franco regime."}]}, "correct": false}

The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany. In an interview in March 2023, Macron said that \"when he began working there were 10 million French pensioners and now there were 17 million\". The New York Times add that in order \"[t]o keep the system financially viable without funneling more taxpayer money into it \u2013 something the government already does \u2013 Macron sought to gradually raise the legal age when workers can start collecting a pension by three months every year until it reaches 64 in 2030.\" Additionally, Macron has \"accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension \u200crules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation\".As part of Macron's pension reforms, the retirement age was to be raised to 64 or 65, from 62.  The pay-as-you-go system \u2013  raising the retirement age would help to further finance, as life expectancy increases and more start work later \u2013 would have a surplus of \u20ac3.2bn in 2022, but the government's pensions advisory board (COR) forecast that it would \"fall into structural deficits in coming decades unless new financing sources are found\". In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that \"without immediate action\" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would \"balance the deficit\" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would \"pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early\".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 \u2013 the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from.In his New Year's Eve speech on 31 December 2022, he clarified that the reforms would be implemented by autumn 2023. In early January 2023 prior to consultation with unions, Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne spoke on FranceInfo radio, stating that the government could \"show flexibility\" on the intention to raise the retirement age to 65, and were willing to explore \"other solutions\" that would enable the government to \"reach its target of balancing the pensions system by 2030\".

Protests erupted after the announcement that the pension reforms would be enacted without a parliamentary vote, Borne invoking article 49:3 of the constitution to do so just \"minutes\" before the scheduled vote on the bill. Inside the National Assembly, opposition MPs on the left booed and jeered the announcement and sang the national anthem in order to prevent Borne from speaking, forcing the session to be briefly suspended before the announcement by Borne was made. Speaking to MPs who were booing her, Borne proclaimed that \"[w]e cannot gamble on the future of our pensions ... The reform is necessary.\"Marine Le Pen announced she would file a no-confidence motion in the government, describing the use of Article 49.3 as \"an extraordinary confession of weakness,\" \"a total failure for the government\", and that Borne should resign.

The Week said that \"Macron and his government insist the reforms are needed to keep the pension system solvent and government borrowing acceptably low\".Politicians from across the political spectrum denounced the move. Conservative MPs, such as those from The Republicans, whom Macron has relied upon for support in votes in the National Assembly, \"rebuke[d] the government, warning that its move would radicalise opponents and undercut the law's democratic legitimacy.\" The Times reported that Macron was thought to have \"hoped earlier on Thursday to hold \u2013 and win \u2013 a parliamentary vote but changed tack after learning that only 35 of the 64 Republican MPs would back the reform, leaving him short of a majority\", quoting Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt, who said that they \"did everything [to have a vote] right up to the last minute\". MoDem MPs, who are aligned with Macron's Renaissance group, said the decision to force the bill through \"was a mistake\"; Erwan Balanant said \"he had left the parliament chamber \"in a state of shock\"\", while \"[o]ther centrist MPs said it was a waste and showed weakness\". Reaction by protesters. In the Place de la Concorde, thousands protested (figures are disputed between 2,000 protesters and 7,000). France 24 reported that it was a \"spontaneous and unplanned rally\", but Le Monde stated that it was \"organized by the union Solidaires and authorized by the administrative court\". La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon spoke to the crowd, declaring that Macron had gone \"over the heads of the will of the people.\" He also claimed the reform had \"no legitimacy \u2013 neither in parliament, nor in the street\". It is possible that many joined the rally in Paris after being turned away by police from the \"blockade of the Veolia warehouse in Aubervilliers\".. Later, a bonfire was lit, with police armed with shields and batons deploying tear gas in an attempt to clear the square at around 8pm. One police officer was reportedly injured.By nightfall, 120 people were reported to have been arrested, according to Parisian police, \"on suspicion of seeking to cause damage\"; by 11:30pm, the number later rose to 217. Protesters in the Place were observed to have thrown cobbled stones at assembled police before they moved in to break up the groups, using tear gas and water cannons, with smaller sections of protesters running down side streets and setting smaller fires, such as to piles of garbage, and \"caused damage to shop fronts\". Numerous makeshift barricades in Paris streets were set alight.The CGT announced further strikes and demonstrations for 23 March; its head, Philippe Martinez, said that the forcing through of the law \"shows contempt towards the people\", with unions describing the move by the government as \"a complete denial of democracy\". France 24 commented that \"unionists were also out in strength, hailing a moral victory even as they denounced Macron's \"violation of democracy\"\".Protests took place in other cities, such as Rennes, Nantes, Lyon, Toulouse, and Marseille.

Police explained this was due to \"serious risks of disturbances to public order and security\", and said those who did not obey this order could be fined. Nevertheless, a bonfire was lit at the Place de la Concorde, with an effigy of Macron dropped onto it to cheers. Despite this, widespread protests were still reported in Paris, with a rally instead planned for Place d'Italie in southern Paris at 6pm that evening, at which demonstrators chanted, once again, for Macron to resign, and \"Macron is going to break down, we are going to win\". 4,000 were present. Barricades were erected in the streets, rubbish bins were set alight, with the glass on billboards and bus shelters smashed. Barriers used to block the streets and bottles were thrown at riot police, who utilised tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters. 81 arrests were made in the vicinity. protesters who gathered at the Place d'Italie then \"marched toward Europe's biggest waste incineration plant, which has become a flashpoint of tensions\", some setting trash cans alight and chanting mottos \"such as \"the streets are ours\" as firefighter sirens wailed\". Politico, quoting the Ministry of the Interior, later reported 122 had been arrested in Paris, with a total of 169 nationwide.. Police also used tear gas against protesters who started a fire in Bordeaux, as BFMTV showed demonstrations in major cities such as Marseille, Compiegne, Nantes (where around a thousand protested), Brest, and Montpellier, with around 200 protesting in Lodeve in the south of France. In Nice, the political office of the leader of the Republicans, \u00c9ric Ciotti, was ransacked, with tags left that threatened riots if the party refused to support any of the motions of no-confidence in the government. In the afternoon in Nantes, protestors threw bottles at police, who also responded with tear gas; in spite of this, DW described the protests in Nantes, as well as Marseille and Montpellier, as \"mostly peaceful marches\", as did the AP. They reported that in Marseille, protesters eluded police and occupied the main train station for approximately 15 minutes. In Besan\u00e7on, \"hundreds of demonstrators lit a brazier and burned voter cards. In Lyon, some demonstrators tried to break into a town hall and set it alight, with police arresting 36; police claimed that \"\"groups of violent individuals\" triggered clashes\".A spokesperson for TotalEnergies reported that 37% of its operational staff at refineries and depots, such as at Feyzin and Normandy, were on strike.

Morning and afternoon. DW reported, on 18 March, that union leaders were anticipating that some airports would see nearly a third of flights cancelled on 20 March, owing to strike action. easyJet and Ryanair, both British airlines, warned passengers to expect disruption. Ryanair said it was \"expecting possible cancellations and delays on flights to and from France from 20 to 23 March.\" Eurostar announced that trains would run a normal service on 20 and 21 March, but there would be disruption to public transport in Lille on 20 March.In the morning, rubbish piles were set alight around the ring road in Rennes as part of a road blockade, with protesters also blockading waste collection points and the nearby Vern-sur-Seiche oil depot was blockaded. The road blockade was attended by a \"few hundred people\". It began at 6:30am, and led to \"over 15 miles of halted traffic around the city\". Police used tear gas and charged towards protesters who were on the road and in surrounding fields. Shortly before midday, it was announced they had all been lifted. However, a damaged road in Porte de Saint-Malo meant the speed limit was temporarily reduced to 70 kilometers per hour. Crisis24 said that industrial action at oil refineries was \"starting to impact fuel supplies\", with shortages of fuel at stations, \"particularly\" in Marseille and the south of the country. Sky News, on 17 March, stated that garbage collection strikes are set to continue until at least 20 March.SNCF has warned of \"disruption to intercity and regional train services\", with only two out of three trains running on several lines of Paris' RATP network. Crisis24 reported that such disruptions will continue until 23 March, when the national strike will exacerbate service provision.On 17 March, teachers' unions called for strikes in the following weeks, possibly disrupting the baccalaur\u00e9at exams, which begin on 20 March. CFDT's Laurent Berger proclaimed that she wished for no disruption to the exams as they could just worsen the already-high stress levels of the students taking them.39% of TotalEnergie workers were on strike.

As well as this, they quoted figures from the UFIP oil lobby that 7% of the country's petrol stations were affected by fuel shortages, (up from 4% prior to the weekend; and that only 5\u20138 of 200 storage facilities were blocked) meaning \"people in major cities in particular would be \"suffering\"; this was worse in some areas, as in Marseille, \"around half of petrol stations are reporting shortages, with an estimated 40 per cent completely closed in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\", and that \"the Paris region could be hit by shortages at the storage facility of Genevilliers, northwest of the French capital\".

On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were \"rounded up\", police justifying the arrests for their \"participation in a group with a view to preparing violence\", or \"concealing their faces\"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to \"file a collective complaint against the police for \"arbitrary detention\" and \"obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate\".\"Such \"arbitrary police custody\", \"mass-arrest\", tactics have been accused \u2013 by politicians, judges and lawyers alike \u2013 of being utilised \"simply to frustrate the protest movement\", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a \"repression of the social movement\". This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used \"criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom,\" said Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods\". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a \"judicialisation of policing\" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of \"participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage\"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the \"violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests\" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Cl\u00e9ment Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that \"there are no unjustified arrests\", and people are questioned for \"offences which, in our eyes, are constituted\" and \"48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short\". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding \"when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others\"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the \"manoeuvre is risky\", as they \"expose the workforce, monopolise officers\" and \"risk radicalising the demonstrators\".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the \"police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week\". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were \"on pretty brutal form\" \u2013 stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press \u2013 and were also throwing their stun grenades with \"abandon\". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be."}]}, "correct": false}

General impact and analysis. Concerns over increasing violence. Multiple outlets, including media and unions, have grown concern over the increasing use of violence in the protests, particularly in the days since the government invoked Article 49.3, with comparisons made to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests of the first years of Macron's presidency. On 19 March, The Guardian commented that as \"police brace[d] for a week of unpredictable, spontaneous protests in cities and small towns across France, the mood of anger was likened to the start of the gilets jaunes protests\". On 20 March, Reuters also voiced that the tone of the protests had deteriorated to, and were \"reminiscent\" to, that of the Yellow Vest protest in recent days. Euronews, on 21 March, claimed that \"government insiders and observers have raised fears that France is again heading for another bout of violent anti-government protests\". On 22 March, Reuters outlined that \"[p]rotests against the bill have drawn huge crowds in rallies organised by unions since January\", of which \"[m]ost have been peaceful, but anger has mounted since the government pushed the bill through parliament without a vote last week\"; \"[t]he past six nights have seen fierce demonstrations across France with bins set ablaze and scuffles with police\".France 24 commented that unions had been \"united in coordinating their protests\", but that \"many expressed fears they could lose control of the protests as more radical demonstrators set the tone\". Fabrice Coudour, a leading representative for the 'hard-left' CGT, commented that \"tougher action ahead, more serious and further-reaching\" was possible that could \"escape our collective decision-making\". Jean-Marie Pernot, a political scientist specialising in trade unions, said that a lack of \"respect [for] any of the channels meant for the expression of dissent, it will find a way to express itself directly\". One of the Yellow Vests' \"prominent spokesmen\", Jerome Rodrigues, spoke to protesters outside the National Assembly after the invoking of Article 49.3 on 17 March, that \"the objective was now nothing less than \"the defeat\" of the president.\"Head of the UNSA trade union federation, Lauren Escure, admitted that \"when there is this much anger and so many French people on the streets, the more radical elements take the floor\", and that it was not something they would want, but was inevitable, and \"will be entirely the government's fault,\" he told AFP. The heads of two 'moderate' unions, Cyril Chabanier of CFTC and Laurent Berger of CFDT, expressed that unions were concerned. Cabanier said that an impression that \"it is just violence that pays\" was being created, and that \"[t]here are some people who are very angry, [and] the anger leads to greater radicalisation and radicalisation unfortunately leads to violence\". Berger has been reported as having warned the government that protests could grow more violent if those protesting begin to feel that the Yellow Vests, in France 24's words, \"achieved more with violence than established unions with their peaceful, mass demonstrations\". Berger told RMC radio, alongside his demand for the reforms to be \"withdrawn\", that his union \"condemn[s] violence\", but added \"look at the anger. It's very strong, even among our ranks\".On 19 March, The Guardian reported that \u2013 alongside the leader of the Republicans' office being vandalised \u2013 other MPs from the party were \"receiving hundreds of threatening emails a day\".

On 7 February, President Erdo\u011fan declared a 3-month state of emergency in the 10 affected provinces: Adana, Hatay, Osmaniye, Kahramanmara\u015f, Gaziantep, Kilis, \u015eanl\u0131urfa, Ad\u0131yaman, Malatya and Diyarbak\u0131r.The national government declared a level four alert to appeal for international aid. According to the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, 25,000 search and rescue personnel were dispatched to the 10 affected provinces. At least 70 countries offered to help in search and rescue operations.. Emergency services in Turkey were activated and looked for survivors trapped under many collapsed buildings. By 8 February, more than 8,000 people were rescued from rubble across 10 provinces. About 380,000 individuals took refuge at relief shelters or hotels.An \"air aid corridor\" was established by the Turkish Armed Forces to mobilize search and rescue teams. Many military aircraft including an Airbus A400M and C-130 Hercules planes transported search and rescue teams and vehicles to the area. Food, blankets and psychological teams were also sent. Turkey sent an official request to NATO and allies for assistance.Over 53,000 Turkish emergency workers were deployed to the regions affected from the earthquakes. A team of 90 miners from Soma arrived at Osmaniye to provide assistance. The Izmir Metropolitan Municipality also sent dozens of vehicles and equipment.Poor weather conditions including snow, rain and freezing temperatures disrupted search and rescue efforts undertaken by rescue workers and civilians. Rescuers and volunteers wore winter clothing while searching for survivors. Damaged roads also slowed down aid delivery.On 8 February, Erdo\u011fan visited the town of Pazarc\u0131k, Kahramanmara\u015f Province and Hatay Province. He acknowledged \"shortcomings\" in the response to the earthquake, but denied that there was an insufficient number of personnel involved in rescue operations. He also described people saying they hadn't seen security forces at all in some areas as \"provocateurs\".AFAD announced on 19 February that search and rescue efforts in most of the affected provinces had ceased. The chairperson of AFAD, Yunus Sezer, said efforts would largely be discontinued by the night of 19 February. Operations were still ongoing for 40 buildings in Kahramanmara\u015f and Hatay provinces by 19 February. Charity and volunteer campaigns. President of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem K\u0131n\u0131k, said the national blood stock may not be sufficient and made an appeal on social media urging people to donate blood across the country. On 7 February, many search and rescue teams from various cities, many from Instanbul, and AFAD volunteers reached the affected areas. At Istanbul, 12,752 volunteers were flown on 73 flights to the region by 06:00. By 11 February, there were over 159,000 volunteer and professional search and rescue personnel in the affected area.Eight of Turkey's most-watched television channels organized a joint broadcast of an aid campaign. The channels; ATV, FOX, Kanal D, Kanal 7, Show TV, Star TV, TRT 1 and TV8 ortak organized the T\u00fcrkiye Beats with One Heart Campaign on 15 February. The broadcast was featured on 213 television channels and 562 radio stations. The campaign received $6.1 billion in donations; the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey was the largest donor, pledging $1.6 billion. Ziraat Bank and Vak\u0131fBank each pledged $1 billion. The Ministry of Youth and Sports, Turkish Football Federation, Super League Clubs Association Foundation and beIN Media Group organized the Omuz Omuza campaign which raised $44.8 million on the first day.

More than 12 hours later, the USGS had reported at least 54 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude, while the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) recorded at least 120 total aftershocks. A Mww\u202f6.3 aftershock struck near Uzunba\u011f in Hatay Province on 20 February; the earthquake was the result of oblique-normal faulting. The Mw\u202f 7.8 earthquake had aftershocks distributed along ~350 km (220 mi) of the EAF.The Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake triggered its own aftershock sequence, including two mb 6.0 aftershocks. Aftershocks of the second earthquake continued through at least 9 Feb. Thousands of aftershocks associated with this earthquake were distributed along an east-west trend corresponding to the \u00c7ardak Fault for about 170 km (110 mi). Seismology. A source model for the Mww\u202f7.8 earthquake produced by the USGS from observed seismic waves, taking into account preliminary rupture mapping from satellite data, uses three fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >40 km (25 mi) \u00d7 30 km (19 mi), 028\u00b0/85\u00b0 (Segment 1), >175 km (109 mi) \u00d7 30 km (19 mi), 060\u00b0/85\u00b0 (Segment 2) and >160 km (99 mi) \u00d7 20 km (12 mi), 025\u00b0/75\u00b0 (Segment 3). The mainshock produced a maximum slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2, beneath Sakarya in Kahramanmara\u015f Province, northeast of the junction where it meets Segment 1. Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Ad\u0131yaman.The USGS source model for the Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70 km (43 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 276\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 1), >40 km (25 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 250\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 2) and ~80 km (50 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 060\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4 m (37 ft).Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw\u202f 7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarc\u0131k and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370 km (230 mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of 9 m (30 ft) along the Pazarc\u0131k segment. The northern end of the rupture was about 20\u201330 km (12\u201319 mi) south of the Mw\u202f 6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the P\u00fct\u00fcrge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12 m (39 ft) from the surface to 7 km (4.3 mi) depth during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake; slip was 11 m (36 ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact\u2014mostly confined to within the \u00c7ardak Fault; it was also shallower\u2014attenuating from 8\u201312 km (5.0\u20137.5 mi). Slip during the Mw\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw\u202f 7.7 event. The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25 km (16 mi) \u00d7 25 km (16 mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth.Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that is was already close to failure."}]}, "correct": true}

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said potential losses may be up to 1 percent of Turkey's GDP in 2023. The Turkish government released a preliminary report estimating the total damage cost at $103.6 billion; corresponding to 9 percent of its GDP in 2023. About half of residential property in the affected area is thought to be covered by Compulsory Earthquake Insurance.. The United Nations Development Programme estimated between 116 million and 210 million tons of debris must be cleared in Turkey. The volume of building debris was estimated at 100 million m3 (3.5 billion cu ft); greater than any recent natural disaster. The amount is 10 times that produced during the 2010 Haiti earthquake.In Syria, the World Bank estimated $5.1 billion in damages, excluding economic impact and losses. Nearly half the cost was direct damage to residential buildings and 18 percent on infrastructure. Aleppo Governate, the worst-affected governate, accounted for 45 percent of the damage cost (equivalent to about $2.3 billion), followed by Idlib and Lattakia governates. The amount of destroyed or damaged capital stock was about 10 percent of Syria's GDP. The World Bank estimated the reconstruction cost at $7.9 billion, additionally the economy may contract by up to 5.5 percent in 2023. Aftermath in Turkey. In the immediate aftermath, thousands were trapped under rubble when buildings collapsed. Many people were missing in collapsed buildings. Survivors trapped under rubble livestreamed their pleas for help on social media. Some trapped survivors shared their location on social media which allowed rescuers to reach them. People who lost contact with their relatives also sent pleas on social media. Several tens of thousands of people across the region were left homeless and spent the night in cold weather. Officials had plans to open hotels in Antalya, Alanya and Mersin to temporarily accommodate the affected population.

Liquefaction was identified via satellite and remote sensing along the southern portion of the Mw\u202f7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments. These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.  Liquefaction was also observed in Samanda\u011f.

G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.. Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in \u0130skenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atat\u00fcrk Boulevard in \u00c7ay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure. The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200 m (660 ft). Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at \u0130skenderun.Despite an epicenter 90 km (56 mi) inland, a tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea.

It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; \u00a33.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. \u0130smail Palako\u011flu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbak\u0131r Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes. The opposition voted no to the measure, claiming that it was unnecessary since the provinces were already declared as \"disaster areas\".A week after the earthquakes in Samanda\u011f, a coastal town in Hatay Province, residents dug through the rubble to look for victims because of the slow and limited government response. \"We have nothing left and the government barely helped us,\" one resident said, adding that assistance only came 48 hours after the earthquake. Media. NetBlocks announced that ICTA limited access to Twitter from Turkey, with Turkish government officials claiming disinformation. According to Reuters, citing an anonymous government official, the block was necessary \"because in some accounts there were untrue claims, slander, insults and posts with fraudulent purposes,\" The block caused public anger as Twitter assisted in sharing information on arriving aid and the whereabouts of survivors still trapped in rubble. The Peoples' Democratic Party said Twitter helped in organizing aid to the affected and the block would \"only cause more death.\""}]}, "correct": true}

Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred further northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Ad\u0131yaman.The USGS source model for the Mw\u202f7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later has three large fault segments with individual lengths, widths, strikes and dips of >70 km (43 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 276\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 1), >40 km (25 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 250\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 2) and ~80 km (50 mi) \u00d7 >20 km (12 mi), 060\u00b0/80\u00b0 (Segment 3). Maximum displacement occurred on Segment 1 at 11.4 m (37 ft).Three segments of the EAF were involved in the Mw\u202f 7.8 rupture; the Amanos, Pazarc\u0131k and Erkenek segments. The earthquake ruptured ~370 km (230 mi) of the EAF, producing a maximum slip of 9 m (30 ft) along the Pazarc\u0131k segment. The northern end of the rupture was about 20\u201330 km (12\u201319 mi) south of the Mw\u202f 6.8 earthquake that struck in 2020. This section of the EAF, the P\u00fct\u00fcrge segment, between both earthquakes, may represent a seismic gap. The southern segment of the EAF rupture was at its termination, near Antakya. Slip peaked at 12 m (39 ft) from the surface to 7 km (4.3 mi) depth during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake; slip was 11 m (36 ft) at the surface. Slip along the fault was compact\u2014mostly confined to within the \u00c7ardak Fault; it was also shallower\u2014attenuating from 8\u201312 km (5.0\u20137.5 mi). Slip during the Mw\u202f 7.8 event extended to 18 km (11 mi) and 12 km (7.5 mi) for the Mw\u202f 7.7 event. The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock that struck Antakya on 20 February had a rupture area of 25 km (16 mi) \u00d7 25 km (16 mi) and produced a peak slip of 0.93 m (3 ft 1 in) at 8.3 km (5.2 mi) depth.Preliminary analysis of the effects of stress changes caused by the M7.8 earthquake on the \u00c7ardak\u2013S\u00fcrg\u00fc Fault, based on the USGS fault model, indicated up to 3 bars of added stress near the epicenter of the M7.7 shock, sufficient to trigger rupture on that zone, assuming that is was already close to failure."}, {"summary_score": 0.8568479318486865, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8226455852386165, "text_rank": 12, "proposition": "Aftershocks occurred on 20 February, with a Mww\u202f6.3 aftershock near Antakya, causing additional buildings to collapse in Samanda\u011f and further damage in Antakya.", "text": "The Department of Fisheries and Marine Research said there was a possible link between the beaching and earthquake as these whales' echolocation system are affected by sea disturbances.The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said shaking was felt in Armenia, Egypt, Palestine, Georgia, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Russia.

Then a week later in a win over Ponsonby he scored 2 more tries and \u201cgave a good display, right up to his best form\u201d.In mid June List was selected for Auckland's second match of the season when they played South Auckland on July 15. South Auckland caused an upset, winning 14\u20130. The \u201cAuckland backs made desperate efforts in the fading stages to get some satisfaction, and in this Brisbane, List and Len Schultz featured, but it was all in vain\u201d in muddy conditions. He then returned to the Marist side and scored a try in a win over Ponsonby on July 29. Marist had finished runner up in the championship to Devonport, and then finished runner up to Newton in the Challenge Cup competition played over 5 rounds. In their loss to Newton on August 19 he was the \u201cbest of the three quarters, and there is no doubt that when he shows his best form he is the best in club football\u201d.List had missed selection for the Auckland side in matches against Taranaki, North Auckland, West Coast, and Hawke's Bay but was chosen in the reserves in their final match of the season against South Auckland on September 9. During the first half Bert Cooke was injured and retired from the match with List coming on to replace him and move to the wing. He missed a try when Stan Prentice had made a break but threw a pass at List's feet which saw him kick it dead. Then before halftime \u201cHassan got his backs away with dispatch, and rapid handling by Schultz and Brisbane enabled List to fly across out wide\u201d to give Auckland a 9\u20132 lead. The Auckland Star said \u201cList did well when he came on for wing duty\u201d."}, {"summary_score": 0.854487469541865, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8131502775191443, "text_rank": null, "proposition": "In the 1930 season, List played 14 matches for Kingsland Athletic and scored 7 tries for them.", "text": "He scored a try in Auckland's 22\u201319 win. \u201cCarter and List, played brightly with limited opportunity and were conspicuous for determined dashes\u201d.

He was chosen in the 22 man Auckland training squad to prepare for their match against Canterbury on August 24. He was ultimately picked in the side to play on the wing. Auckland won 47-18 before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park with List scoring the home side's final try. The Herald said that \u201cList showed more determination than in other matches and played really well\u201d. His final match of the season was for Kingsland when they were eliminated in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition 9-3 by Marist. He \u201ccombined well in the three-quarter line [with Carter] and they were repeatedly conspicuous for strong running\u201d. He failed to make the North Island side to play the South Island a week later.. The 1930 season saw List play 14 matches for Kingsland Athletic, and once again he scored 7 tries for them. This placed him equal ninth in the club try scoring list. He only played one match for Auckland out of their three matches. Prior to the start of the season in team previews the Auckland Star said \u201cList is a steady and resolute exponent with plenty of experience\u201d. Kingsland lost their opening game to Marist 16-13 but were awarded the victory as Marist had fielded an unregistered player. List was involved in much of Kingsland's attacking work. After their round 2 loss to Devonport List was selected in the 23 man training squad for Auckland's match with Northland. He then played for Kingsland against Newton on May 10 in a 14\u20138 loss. The Sun said that he \u201cwas on form, and his deadly fend proved a regular nightmare to some members of the opposition, but he failed to run straight, and gave his wingers insufficient room in which to work\u201d.. List was then named on the wing for Auckland for their May 17 match with Northland. Auckland won the match 21-16 before a crowd of 8,000 at Carlaw Park. List had a rare poor game and \u201ca weak attempt at tackling by him let Whitelaw, the visitor\u2019s right winger, run rings around him\u201d, resulting in a try to Dunn. The Auckland Star said \u201cList by no means justified his selection\u201d, he \u201cwas uncertain in his movements, dropped passes all to frequently, and did not prove a match for his vis-a-vis, Whitelaw\u201d. The Sun said \u201cneither List nor R. Carter was very impressive. List seemed to be right off his game. He has been so long at centre that he appeared to be at a loss to know what to do on the wing\u201d.He was \"again disappointing\" in Kingsland's next match with Richmond on May 24. He \u201cmishandled at times, but was given few real chances\u201d. The New Zealand side was touring Australia later in the season so his poor form was relevant for further rep honours in 1930. He was then omitted from the Auckland side to play South Auckland on May 31 after having been named in a 20-man squad to train prior.List spent the remainder of the season in the maroon jersey of Kingsland. The following week he scored a try in a 31\u201310 loss to Ellerslie where he played well but had few opportunities. His play then turned around in a narrow 17\u201313 loss to City. He \u201cstruck his best form and was a tower of strength to his side. It was about his best exhibition this season\u201d. Both he and Carter were \u201coutstanding and were responsible to no mean extent for the showing made by their side\u201d. List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13\u20136 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was \u201ceasily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards\u201d. He \u201cat centre, was brilliant in patches\u201d. List then scored two tries in Kingsland's 13\u20135 win over Newton. He \u201cgave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago\u201d. The Sun said he \u201cplayed a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday\u201d.

Despite being a newcomer to the senior game the Auckland Star said that he was a little unlucky to not make the tour. List was chosen as a reserve for the Auckland side to play New Zealand on July 2 prior to their departure but did not take the field.He then returned to his Kingsland side for 3 more club matches. The New Zealand Herald said that he was one of the players who had shown \u201cparticularly fine form\u201d and was a young player who was in the frame for selection for Auckland's Southern Tour later in the season. After one further match for Kingsland on July 25 and following a bye he was named as an emergency player for Auckland's match with South Auckland (Waikato) on August 19. Following Kingsland's loss to Otahuhu in the Stallard Cup, List was selected in the Auckland touring side. It was stated that he was 22 years old and weighed 12 stone.With the New Zealand side on tour with a large number of Auckland players, the Auckland team was officially a B side with several young players aged 19 to 22. Their first match was against West Coast at Greymouth on the West Coast on September 9. Auckland B won the match 22 to 15 with List scoring a try.

The loss of these fisheries could then be assumed to potentially result in the loss of that revenue. In addition, as reported by the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, the numbers mentioned in these reports do not take into account the fact that recreational salmon and steelhead fishing is more costly than other sport fishing types and therefore accounts for more than their percentage of the total. In addition, these figures do not include economic totals from commercial or tribal fisheries. Local economics. Salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead and many other fish that are used economically will be negatively affected by the increase in temperatures. Southern species, including Hake and Mackerel are predators of baby salmon. Scientists say these species have been feeding on salmon migrating out of the Columbia River.  These fish need cold and clean water to reproduce successfully. The high and low flows of the rivers will be shifted in the seasons, negatively affecting salmon rearing. Increases in water temperatures could affect the food for fish in rivers, lakes, Puget Sound and coastal ocean regions. Fishing is big business in the Pacific Northwest and many local economies depend on fishing. There is a current debate on how to allocate the run of salmon. The local Native American tribes get a modest percentage of the statewide income from salmon fishing, with the majority going to commercial fishermen. The ones left out are the sport fishermen, those who participate in recreational fishing. The economic problem with this is that sport fishermen spend much more money per fish caught, and since they are less efficient, they drive the economy through the Spending multiplier throughout the local economy. The salmon allocation is hotly contested and when salmon populations are low, local economies suffer the majority of the impact. During 2007, the commercial fishermen caught 43% and the sport fishermen caught 57% of the total fish. Native Americans' treaties guarantee them a maximum of 50% of the total run before the commercial and sport fishers take their share, under the Boldt Decision of 1974. Human health. Impacts on infectious diseases  West Nile fever is a serious disease linked to climate change in the US that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It favors periods of drought and heavy rain, which are likely to become more common as increased average temperatures in Washington State result in rain replacing snowfall during the winter, resulting in drier summers (chance of drought, particularly east of the Cascades).  The mosquitoes will also survive longer because the warmer winters will not eliminate as many bugs as it usually does. Documentation of the West Nile virus is just beginning in Washington State, but Colorado has been grappling with cases of it since 2002. Total costs there have been estimated at $120 million or $670 million (P. 58), both as of 2006. Louisiana has been battling cases since 2001, with total costs of $190 million by 2006.  In the hopes of avoiding these costs, the Washington Department of Health spends $246,000 per year on surveillance for the virus and Epidemiological follow-up and testing on suspected human cases (P. 59). Dengue fever is an infectious disease also carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of four related dengue viruses. It is also called \"break-bone\" fever because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. Health experts have known about dengue fever for more than 200 years.. An epidemic in Hawaii in 2001 was a reminder that many locations in the United States are susceptible to dengue epidemics because they harbor the particular types of mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.. Worldwide, 50-100 million cases of dengue infection occur each year. This includes 100-200 cases in the United States, mostly in people who have recently traveled abroad. Many more cases probably go unreported, because some health care providers do not recognize the disease.. Impacts on respiratory illnesses, (such as asthma and allergies) . Washington's asthma prevalence is among the highest in the nation, costing the state over $400 million yearly. 400,000 adults and 120,000 children suffer from it in Washington. Though increases in average yearly temperatures is the hallmark of global warming, human activities are the cause of greenhouse gases like emissions from cars, power plants, and airborne particles from human-caused forest fires. Global warming has a \"direct\" effect on respiratory illnesses because increased CO2 levels stimulate pollen production, which stimulates allergies. More frequent flooding in WA State will increase the growth of fungus, also exacerbating allergies. Increased carbon dioxide levels have already and will continue to increase the level of pollen output in the state."}]}, "correct": false}

Human activity has already changed atmospheric characteristics such as temperature, rainfall, levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ground level ozone. The scientific community expects such trends to continue. Warmer climate may give positive effects on food production; however, the increased potential for weather extremes will pose challenges for farmers. Moreover, water supply and soil moisture could make it less feasible to continue crop production in certain areas.. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) concluded: Recent studies indicate that increased frequency of heat stress, droughts and floods negatively affect crop yields and livestock beyond the impacts of mean climate change, creating the possibility for surprises, with impacts that are larger and occurring earlier than predicted using changes in mean variables alone. This is especially the case for subsistence sectors at low latitudes. Climate variability and change also modify the risks of fires, pest and pathogen outbreak, negatively affecting food, fiber, and forestry.. Climate Factors. Several factors directly connect climate change and agricultural productivity: Change in precipitation amount and patterns. Rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Pollution levels such as ground level ozone. Change in climatic variability and extreme eventsMost agricultural impact studies have considered the effects of one or two aspects of climate change on a particular farming activity. Few, however, have considered the full set of anticipated shifts and their impact on agricultural production across the country.. The ways in which climate changes in Washington will affect agriculture are largely unknown. One benefit which climate change may potentially have on agriculture is the possibility of longer growing seasons. However, some of the negative effects include reduced water supply and higher demand for water. Some of the unknown effects are changes in the behavior of weeds, pests and crop diseases.. With the shifts in climate, Washington exports of agriculture goods may fluctuate. The impacts of these fluctuations are largely unknown due to the complexity and unknown extent of the changes to come. Yakima Valley. The Yakima River Basin is the most productive and driest agricultural region in Washington state. Yakima, Kittitas, and Benton County of the River Basin produced $1.3 billion in agricultural economic output in 2004. Without adequate water available for irrigation, the basin will face serious economic impacts. Research at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) determined that the $1.3 billion output was due to water availability. Past droughts caused 10-15% losses of economic output, not including the accumulation of water loss over the years. Compared to a \"good year\" where the outputs are estimated at $901 million, droughts and crop losses will become more prevalent due to water shortages increasing from $13 to $79 million per year by mid-century. Water shortages will cause higher costs for farmers and amplify economic losses during drought years. Expected global increases in temperatures will have economic effects not easy to quantify. Decreased snowpack and earlier runoff will decrease stream flow. Higher temperatures will increase evaporation in the soil and decrease its capacity to hold moisture for plants during the hottest parts of the growing season. Insects will find a haven in warmer temperatures and become a greater problem.  The Columbia River Gorge is beginning show signs of adapting to warmer temperatures by producing a 3rd generation yearly. Increased numbers of hot days (over 100 \u00b0F) are expected to cause increased levels of heat-related illness, which makes the agricultural workers population especially vulnerable. . Simple tools developed to forecast the impacts of El Ni\u00f1o on agriculture irrigation can also be used to estimate the impacts of water shortages during climate change.  Studies that focus on the water availability to the 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of orchards, vineyards, and food crops within the Yakima River Valley exploit the effects of a climate change in the region. Irrigation draws water from only five reservoirs and snowpack from the Cascades. With the arrival of early snowfall and a premature diminish, irrigation water supply is predicted to drop 20-40% in a year at mid-century due to this dramatic change."}]}, "correct": true}

Malaysia's foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah replied to the Singapore government in a statement that they acknowledged Nagaenthran's execution and this issue would not affect the diplomatic ties between Malaysia and Singapore, as they uphold their respect for the sovereignty rights of Singapore to decide on its own judicial system and laws.In response to the United Nations' criticism of Singapore, Ambassador Umej Bhatia defended the government's decisions to execute Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman, as well as their use of the death penalty on drugs. Bhatia stated that all criminal proceedings in Singapore were conducted with due process before an \"impartial and independent judiciary\", and the death penalty would be passed on any suspect if their guilt were proven according to the law. He drew attention to Singapore's decades-long reputation for having a fair and impartial criminal justice system, and an independent and effective judiciary.

British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit."}]}, "correct": true}

Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court."}]}, "correct": true}

Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice. Bailes also stated in his own words, \"Witnesses, juries and courts make mistakes, but the death penalty once carried out is irreversible.\" The case of Nagaenthran also brought to attention the past cases of Australians executed for drug offences in Southeast Asian countries (e.g. Barlow and Chambers execution in Malaysia, Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore, and both Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Bali Nine in Indonesia) and Australia's public opposition against the death penalty.The case of Nagaenthran's execution brought attention to the cases of the nine remaining Malaysians (including Datchinamurthy Kataiah and Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) on Singapore's death row, as well as four other Malaysians hanged for drug trafficking prior to Nagaenthran's execution. The risk of execution of these nine Malaysians despite being alleged couriers or allegedly disabled brought concern to the activists who opposed the death penalty. The United Nations also criticised Singapore for executing Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman and stated that Singapore should impose a moratorium as a first step to abolish the death penalty, and urged Singapore to not execute Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was the third drug trafficker facing imminent execution in Singapore. Government's response. On the same day Nagaenthran was executed, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) made an official statement, in which they strongly condemned the allegations and rumours spread in relation to Nagaenthran's case, especially those seeking to \"cast aspersions\" on the involvement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, in which these rumours falsely suggested any form of bias made by Menon in his judgement in Nagaenthran's appeal. The AGC commented that the lawsuit against Menon was the seventh legal application (not including appeals) made on behalf of Nagaenthran, and they described the lawsuit as \"the latest attempt to abuse the court's processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran.\"The AGC also mentioned that prior to the lawsuit, it was specifically mentioned to Nagaenthran's counsel about Chief Justice Menon's appointment as the Attorney General during the prosecution of Nagaenthran, and Nagaenthran himself, under his lawyer's advice, made no objections for Menon to preside the lawsuit. However, this information appeared to be \"deliberately\" withheld from Nagaenthran's mother when she brought forward the lawsuit, since Nagaenthran's mother had filed the application with the help of friends and activists, the organisations of legal papers clearly were not solely the work of Nagaenthran's mother, and both the signature and email address did not belong to Nagaenthran's mother. Therefore, for these above reasons, there was no basis at all in making the application. The AGC responded in the official statement that these allegations amounted to \"contempt of the court\", and reiterated that it \"takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice\".On 28 April 2022, the day after Nagaenthran's execution, both the AGC and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) made statements to defend Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran in light of the international condemnation of Singapore and the execution."}, {"summary_score": 0.8754367935693471, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8825174620556775, "text_rank": 2, "proposition": "Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists, including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH, tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency for Nagaenthran Dharmalingam.", "text": "Opposition to execution. Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran's execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran's case a \"flagrant breach\" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia's Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran's sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother's execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran's mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran's family. This allowed Nagaenthran's mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran's brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a \"five-year-old child\", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, \"Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation.

Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran's execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran's case a \"flagrant breach\" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia's Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran's sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother's execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran's mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran's family. This allowed Nagaenthran's mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran's brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a \"five-year-old child\", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, \"Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation.

British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit."}]}, "correct": true}

Together with M Ravi, LFL asked the Malaysian government to bring forward Nagaenthran's case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Global Commission on Drug Policy, citing the case of Nagaenthran, stated that the death penalty was an inappropriate response to any offences, including drug-related crimes. A protest was also made on 3 April 2022 at Hong Lim Park against the government's use of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's failed appeal. Besides, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) was urged to intervene in Nagaenthran's case and other death penalty issues from Singapore, as well as advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in the ASEAN member nations.While some netizens felt that Nagaenthran should be spared from the gallows and the death penalty should be removed, others agreed with and supported the judges' standing that Nagaenthran clearly knew the magnitude and consequences of his crime and stated he should face execution for his crime. Earlier in the same month Nagaenthran lost his appeal, a 2021 survey result was publicly revealed and it showed that more than 80% of Singaporeans believed that the death penalty should remain in Singapore due to its deterrent effect and relevance in fighting crime.M Ravi told the reporters that due to the complete exhaustion of avenues of appeal on Malaysia's part, no more appeals would be lodged and the execution could take place in days, but he continued to express his support for Nagaenthran's life to be spared. The concern that Nagaenthran's execution would take place soon was further intensified when 68-year-old Changi Prison inmate Abdul Kahar bin Othman, a Singaporean drug convict, was confirmed to be executed at dawn on 30 March 2022, making Abdul Kahar the first person to be hanged in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.On 16 April 2022, rights advocate Kokila Annamalai revealed in a Malaysian newspaper that a second clemency appeal submitted by Nagaenthran's family and supporters was rejected by the President of Singapore on 31 March 2022. Having personally witnessed the tender, loving moments between Nagaenthran and his family members during their prison visits and court session, Annamalai shared her sadness towards Nagaenthran for his imminent fate and she stated that there should be more to be done regarding the issue of capital punishment in Singapore, and criticised Singapore for a lack of mercy on Nagaenthran. The Guardian and Malaysian newspapers also confirmed that Nagaenthran's death sentence was upheld by the dismissal of his second clemency plea, and Ravi criticised the decision to reject clemency on Nagaenthran. Second death warrant. On 20 April 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) informed Nagaenthran's mother that her son's execution was rescheduled to take place on 27 April 2022, and that extended daily visits would be facilitated for the family until the eve of his execution. This announcement led to requests for the Malaysian government to delay Nagaenthran's execution by taking the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Upon receiving her son's second death warrant, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam appeared on Facebook in a video clip, in which she made a public apology on behalf of her son, and she begged for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran's life.By then, Amnesty International also filed a petition to seek clemency on behalf of Nagaenthran, and the petition itself garnered more than 8,000 signatures.

The AGC responded in the official statement that these allegations amounted to \"contempt of the court\", and reiterated that it \"takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice\".On 28 April 2022, the day after Nagaenthran's execution, both the AGC and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) made statements to defend Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran in light of the international condemnation of Singapore and the execution. The AGC reiterated in a statement that Nagaenthran was given a fair trial and had \"exhausted his rights of appeal and almost every other recourse under the law over some 11 years\", while the CNB said in a separate statement that Nagaenthran's actions when committing the crime was \"a deliberate, purposeful and calculated decision\" and cited the related court findings, in which the judges all agreed that \"he knew what he was doing\" at the time of the offence.The CNB also said that there were too much misinformation spread about Nagaenthran's mental state, and they reiterated that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled at the time of his offence since he had tried to evade the authorities and also narrated too many inconsistent accounts of how and what led to him committing the offences. The government's stand received support from many who discussed the case.On 29 April 2022, it was revealed that three days before Nagaenthran's execution, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan had both responded to their Malaysian counterparts that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process under the law when they received the government's letter to review Nagaenthran's case and sentence. Malaysia's foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah replied to the Singapore government in a statement that they acknowledged Nagaenthran's execution and this issue would not affect the diplomatic ties between Malaysia and Singapore, as they uphold their respect for the sovereignty rights of Singapore to decide on its own judicial system and laws.In response to the United Nations' criticism of Singapore, Ambassador Umej Bhatia defended the government's decisions to execute Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman, as well as their use of the death penalty on drugs. Bhatia stated that all criminal proceedings in Singapore were conducted with due process before an \"impartial and independent judiciary\", and the death penalty would be passed on any suspect if their guilt were proven according to the law. He drew attention to Singapore's decades-long reputation for having a fair and impartial criminal justice system, and an independent and effective judiciary. Bhatia rebutted that there was no racial discrimination in response to the allegations of racial bias over the large number of minorities on Singapore's death row, and he cited that all individuals were subjected to equal and fair treatment under the laws of Singapore and were not given different treatment based on race or nationality. Bhatia reiterated that there was no need to impose a moratorium since there was no international consensus against the use of the death penalty \"when it is imposed according to the due process of law\", and added there was \"no explicit definition\" under international law or international consensus on what constitutes the \"most serious crimes\". Bhatia ended off his statement by citing that every country has its sovereign right to determine its own criminal justice system, considering its own circumstances and in accordance with its international law obligations.With regards to Nagaenthran's case and the abuse of court processes made by Nagaenthran's lawyers, Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim stated that they accepted there were bound to be some liberal citizens harbouring passionate views towards capital punishment but he reiterated that there should be basic respect given to the law and it was unacceptable for individuals to repeatedly launch appeals in an concluded capital case without tangible evidence. He also said that there would be legislative changes made and passed to stem down and issue penalties for every abuse of court processes. In addition, Faishal also highlighted the negative effects of drug abuse and how it may not only ruin the lives of drug abusers (and their loved ones) but also lead to crimes committed by suspects under the influence of drugs, citing the recent March 2022 cases of the Buangkok Crescent sword attack, the Queenstown knife attack of two people and the fatal police shooting of a knife-wielding fugitive drug abuser as examples to support his case. He stated that the war on drugs would continue on in Singapore in spite of the growing liberal attitudes of some young people towards drug use. HARDtalk interview."}]}, "correct": false}

They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals."}, {"summary_score": 0.8587899863745752, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8617837901517651, "text_rank": 1, "proposition": "Nagaenthran was executed at Changi Prison in Singapore on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, after being arrested for drug trafficking 13 years ago.", "text": "Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations. Nagaenthran's 36-year-old sister Sharmila said that the family was saddened and shocked at their loss, and they were dissatisfied with Nagaenthran's final sentence despite coming to terms with his death. The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran's sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran's remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh. Over 200 family members and friends were present at the funeral.

Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve's director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a \"disgraceful act\" which was \"ruthlessly carried out\" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice."}]}, "correct": false}

Bailes also stated in his own words, \"Witnesses, juries and courts make mistakes, but the death penalty once carried out is irreversible.\" The case of Nagaenthran also brought to attention the past cases of Australians executed for drug offences in Southeast Asian countries (e.g. Barlow and Chambers execution in Malaysia, Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore, and both Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Bali Nine in Indonesia) and Australia's public opposition against the death penalty.The case of Nagaenthran's execution brought attention to the cases of the nine remaining Malaysians (including Datchinamurthy Kataiah and Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) on Singapore's death row, as well as four other Malaysians hanged for drug trafficking prior to Nagaenthran's execution. The risk of execution of these nine Malaysians despite being alleged couriers or allegedly disabled brought concern to the activists who opposed the death penalty. The United Nations also criticised Singapore for executing Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman and stated that Singapore should impose a moratorium as a first step to abolish the death penalty, and urged Singapore to not execute Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was the third drug trafficker facing imminent execution in Singapore. Government's response. On the same day Nagaenthran was executed, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) made an official statement, in which they strongly condemned the allegations and rumours spread in relation to Nagaenthran's case, especially those seeking to \"cast aspersions\" on the involvement of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, in which these rumours falsely suggested any form of bias made by Menon in his judgement in Nagaenthran's appeal. The AGC commented that the lawsuit against Menon was the seventh legal application (not including appeals) made on behalf of Nagaenthran, and they described the lawsuit as \"the latest attempt to abuse the court's processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran.\"The AGC also mentioned that prior to the lawsuit, it was specifically mentioned to Nagaenthran's counsel about Chief Justice Menon's appointment as the Attorney General during the prosecution of Nagaenthran, and Nagaenthran himself, under his lawyer's advice, made no objections for Menon to preside the lawsuit. However, this information appeared to be \"deliberately\" withheld from Nagaenthran's mother when she brought forward the lawsuit, since Nagaenthran's mother had filed the application with the help of friends and activists, the organisations of legal papers clearly were not solely the work of Nagaenthran's mother, and both the signature and email address did not belong to Nagaenthran's mother. Therefore, for these above reasons, there was no basis at all in making the application. The AGC responded in the official statement that these allegations amounted to \"contempt of the court\", and reiterated that it \"takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice\".On 28 April 2022, the day after Nagaenthran's execution, both the AGC and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) made statements to defend Singapore's decision to hang Nagaenthran in light of the international condemnation of Singapore and the execution."}, {"summary_score": 0.8484627394788921, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.836513875569862, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "Protests against Nagaenthran's execution intensified as the death warrant for another Malaysian drug convict, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, was finalized.", "text": "Rights activist Kokila Annamalai was set to organise a candlelight vigil on behalf of Nagaenthran at Hong Lim Park on 25 April 2022, and Nagaenthran's family and three siblings prepared to travel to Singapore to visit him in Changi Prison. British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state. Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit."}]}, "correct": false}

Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court. However, a psychiatric report concluded that Nagaenthran had neither of the above. He was also not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the CNB, since he did not substantively assist them in disrupting the drug trafficking activities. Despite this, on 24 February 2015, Nagaenthran brought forward the application and tried to ask for mercy based on the conditions of an intellectual disability, low IQ, impaired executive functioning and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which would have made him ineligible for the death penalty. High Court reviews. In 2017, the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's re-sentencing application. Four psychiatric and psychological experts, including one called by the defence, agreed that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled. The High Court also found that Nagaenthran had repeatedly changed \"his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed\". The High Court found that Nagaenthran showed that he was \"capable of manipulation and evasion\" during his offence, as Nagaenthran tried to dissuade Central Narcotics Bureau officers from searching him at the checkpoint by stating that he was \"working in security\", playing into the \"social perception of the trustworthiness of security officers.\"In 2018, the High Court dismissed another appeal of Nagaenthran's case. Court of Appeal review. After the High Court dismissed Nagaenthran's appeal for re-sentencing, Nagaenthran, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, filed two separate appeals to ask for the Court of Appeal to commute his sentence under the newly enacted death penalty laws, but the five-judge Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on 27 May 2019. The Court of Appeal said that there were numerous inconsistencies in Nagaenthran's account of his crime, which made it hard to rely on his defence given that they affected his credibility. The five judges - Sundaresh Menon, Belinda Ang, Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, and Chao Hick Tin - held that Nagaenthran may have a low IQ, but his mental responsibility for his offence was not substantially impaired. He was able to plan and organise on simpler terms, and was relatively adept at living independently.. Besides, Nagaenthran had known that it was unlawful for him to import heroin, and hid the drugs to avoid detection. He was also prone to being manipulative and evasive, as shown from his initial attempts to avoid being searched before the narcotics officers arrested him in 2009. Additionally, he was earlier found to have done this with the intention of paying off some of his debts, and his actions were deliberate, calculated and purposeful, which was \"the working of a criminal mind\" and was able to weigh the benefits and risks, and the concept of right or wrong. Hence, Nagaenthran lost his final bid to be re-sentenced. Clemency petition and first public attention. Nagaenthran later appealed to the President of Singapore Halimah Yacob for clemency, which would have commuted his sentence to life imprisonment if successful, but his plea was rejected on 1 June 2020, which finalized his death sentence. The last time clemency was granted in Singapore was in 1998, when 19-year-old Mathavakannan Kalimuthu was pardoned from execution despite being sentenced to hang for murdering a gangster in 1996."}, {"summary_score": 0.8535838171033635, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8636992384021541, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur.", "text": "\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival. A man was arrested on 4 November 2021 for posting a poster advocating against Nagaenthran's death sentence at a train in Kuala Lumpur, which was classified as an illegal act of public provocation. Government's response and further pleas for mercy. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later released a statement in view of the increasing pressure to spare Nagaenthran's life. They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection. A last-minute appeal was heard on 8 November, two days before Nagaenthran was due to hang, and M Ravi argued the appeal at the High Court. The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion. M Ravi has no medical expertise and met the Malaysian only once and interacted with him for just 26 minutes on 2 November 2021, six days before the appeal hearing. Justice See was also not convinced by Ravi's arguments regarding international law violations because of capital punishment, as he stated there is no legal basis for international law to take precedence over domestic law, concluding the appeal by stating that the law should take its course since Nagaenthran had already been accorded full due process and exhausted his appeals."}]}, "correct": false}

The government's stand received support from many who discussed the case.On 29 April 2022, it was revealed that three days before Nagaenthran's execution, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan had both responded to their Malaysian counterparts that Nagaenthran was accorded full due process under the law when they received the government's letter to review Nagaenthran's case and sentence. Malaysia's foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah replied to the Singapore government in a statement that they acknowledged Nagaenthran's execution and this issue would not affect the diplomatic ties between Malaysia and Singapore, as they uphold their respect for the sovereignty rights of Singapore to decide on its own judicial system and laws.In response to the United Nations' criticism of Singapore, Ambassador Umej Bhatia defended the government's decisions to execute Nagaenthran and Abdul Kahar Othman, as well as their use of the death penalty on drugs. Bhatia stated that all criminal proceedings in Singapore were conducted with due process before an \"impartial and independent judiciary\", and the death penalty would be passed on any suspect if their guilt were proven according to the law. He drew attention to Singapore's decades-long reputation for having a fair and impartial criminal justice system, and an independent and effective judiciary. Bhatia rebutted that there was no racial discrimination in response to the allegations of racial bias over the large number of minorities on Singapore's death row, and he cited that all individuals were subjected to equal and fair treatment under the laws of Singapore and were not given different treatment based on race or nationality. Bhatia reiterated that there was no need to impose a moratorium since there was no international consensus against the use of the death penalty \"when it is imposed according to the due process of law\", and added there was \"no explicit definition\" under international law or international consensus on what constitutes the \"most serious crimes\". Bhatia ended off his statement by citing that every country has its sovereign right to determine its own criminal justice system, considering its own circumstances and in accordance with its international law obligations.With regards to Nagaenthran's case and the abuse of court processes made by Nagaenthran's lawyers, Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim stated that they accepted there were bound to be some liberal citizens harbouring passionate views towards capital punishment but he reiterated that there should be basic respect given to the law and it was unacceptable for individuals to repeatedly launch appeals in an concluded capital case without tangible evidence. He also said that there would be legislative changes made and passed to stem down and issue penalties for every abuse of court processes. In addition, Faishal also highlighted the negative effects of drug abuse and how it may not only ruin the lives of drug abusers (and their loved ones) but also lead to crimes committed by suspects under the influence of drugs, citing the recent March 2022 cases of the Buangkok Crescent sword attack, the Queenstown knife attack of two people and the fatal police shooting of a knife-wielding fugitive drug abuser as examples to support his case. He stated that the war on drugs would continue on in Singapore in spite of the growing liberal attitudes of some young people towards drug use.

Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court."}]}, "correct": false}

The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy\u2014a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle.

From the livestock-raising regions animals were taken to market by train, mostly to Chicago. onto which 17 railroads converged.  At the Chicago stockyards there was a special market for \"export grade\" cattle; these were railed to ports on the eastern seaboard for shipment to England.  The map also shows the Canadian Pacific Railway that took livestock from the foothills of the Rocky mountains to Montreal. Lengthy journeys. Animals were not supposed to travel more than 28 hours at a time, according to a U.S. federal law of 1873, after which they must be got off the train for water, food and 5 hours rest.  Quite often at these stops, however, the railroad companies, who were not very enthusiastic about the cattle trade, neglected to provide proper water or food, or there was nowhere to rest because the station stockyard was a sea of mud or a drift of snow.The 28-hour limit was widely ignored, and there was even something to be said for that, because repeatedly unloading and reloading the animals could do them more harm than leaving them on the train.  Thus in 1906 the law was amended to allow animals to be carried for up to 36 hours at a time if the owners agreed, and from now on the law was enforced'Palace' or \"parlor\" stock cars were special vehicles supposed to furnish water and hay for animals to consume en route, and hence exempted from the 28-hour law.  Thus they could and did run for 60 or even 100 hours at a time.  It seems that in reality, however, water and food were seldom supplied to these vehicles: some thought they were a sham. Overcrowding and injury. Shipping space was usually sold by the carload, so there was an incentive to cram in as many animals as possible to save freight charges, which were high.  Some held that tight packing was good for the animals because it stopped them fighting or lying down, or falling over when the engine jerked the train or when it went round a tight curve. If a steer did fall, or lay down to rest, there was a risk that it might never get up again.  Consequently cattle attendants, who travelled in the caboose, went round at intervals and, if they spotted a recumbent animal, tried to make it stand up.  For this purpose there was a special tool called a cattle prod which, if the steer was not actually dying, usually worked.  A stockman recalled: The toughest job I ever undertook was to start from the Missouri River and land a consignment of cattle in the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, without a loss. The first run was three hundred miles across the State of Iowa to the Mississippi River; it generally took thirty-six hours, two nights and a day. In loading cattle, on account of the freight charges, you naturally would get every steer in a car you could. The steers had \"standing room only\"; consequently, if a steer got down, which was a very common occurrence, on account of the fatigue from standing too long, it was either to get that steer on his feet again or he would be trampled to death, and away would go the profit on that car of cattle.. He described how:Sometimes you could raise him by standing alongside of the car and using your prod \u2014 a pole about six feet long with a sharp iron point in one end of it \u2014 but often you had to climb into the end window of the car and go right among them, horns, droppings, and all, and take your chances of ever getting out alive, the trainmen paying no attention to you, the train running thirty miles an hour, and maybe it is night and as dark as pitch. . A government official wrote: \"Under the present system not a train is brought to any great market without having many crippled beeves, and several dead ones\". In Canada. There was no 28-hour law in Canada and rail journeys were immense. The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was \"sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer\", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain \"gaunt and shrunken\".

By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).  Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations \u2014 that animals need not be put up for sale on market days \u2014 to bypass the marketing system altogether.  See The Beef Trust, below.. Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford. Cattle boats. Cattle boats from the Continent \u2014 over a thousand a year \u2014 came up the Thames on Sundays and Wednesdays.As the transatlantic cattle trade developed (see below), large ocean-going cattle steamers came into use, but these were reluctant to come alongside.  Accordingly the market purchased three paddle steamers (named Racoon, Taurus and Claude Hamilton) into which cattle were transshipped at Gravesend.  Between them, those vessels conveyed more than 1.6 million animals to Deptford. Jack the Ripper, Deptford cattle boat man. One of the many theories about Jack the Ripper was that he was a Portuguese cattle attendant on a boat from Porto.  When it docked at Deptford, a Whitechapel murder ensued, or so insisted a customs official who claimed to see a statistical correlation.  His persistence irritated the police, but his theory was noticed by Queen Victoria.  \"The Queen fears the Detective Department is not as efficient as it might be...  Have the cattle boats & passenger boats been examined?\" Veterinary. On landing, animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon who took their pulse and temperature.  Suspects were set aside for observation.  If one animal in a cargo was found to be contagious, it was slaughtered at once and its carcase sterilised by steam in an iron digester; its companions were put with the suspects.  Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.  The Essex man, needing a good steed, had been induced by a glowing advertisement to pay \u00a330 for a horse, viewable at Deptford Market.  He did not realise it was in no condition to be ridden away. George Philcox. To find a superintendent for the market the City interviewed 25 candidates, and chose a 28-year old Southend station-master, George Philcox.  Philcox was in charge of the market for the next 40 years; when he died in 1912, it soon closed.  Apparently an able and popular man, it was said \"The market made him, and in turn he made it\". Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees.

Over the years roughly half of London's meat came from the Foreign Cattle Market.  As a consumer of meat, the London of the era has been described as the greatest market in the world.  \"The British were beef hungry. They had the money to buy meat in any market, and as the great creditor nation they were at a distinct advantage in purchasing livestock in America and in the rest of the world\".  It was described as the first globalisation.Hence Deptford market was much more than a set of buildings on the Thames.  From it radiated a web of commercial relationships that went out to livestock producers in distant parts of the planet.  For example a salesman at Deptford could be representing a cattle buyer in (say) Chicago, who might get his supplies from finishers in the American Cornbelt, who were supplied by Western ranchers, and so on. From Europe. Early days. Describing the pull of London as a meat market for European farmers, Richard Peet said \"It was as though a city of several million people were located just off the Dutch coast\".  A journalist, visiting Deptford market in 1889, reported:From July to December the imports are greatest from the Northern Dutch and Baltic ports; from January to June the trade is briskest from Flushing and the Belgian ports; all the year round Germany sends us sheep from Bremen and Hamburg, and Spain and Portugal send cattle from Vigo and Oporto.. The Spanish cattle were \"beautiful chestnut brown in colour, sleek and well-built, though rather depressed in look, as Spanish cattle always are\".Some animals had more distant origins. Forrest Capie and Richard Perren said that, although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were [just] the terminal stations of a great network of main German railway lines and branch lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia and extended right up to Bessarabian frontier. In the 1860s the Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before they reached their port of embarkation. ."}]}, "correct": false}

It was their job to drive the animals off the boats, or to transship them from the transatlantic steamers at Gravesend.   Nearly all the drovers begin their life in the market as \"ochre boys\", that is, boys who mark the animals with ochre for the butchers, and who are paid a few pence for so doing.

Drovers at Deptford market were paid a lump sum per vessel, George Philcox told Booth.  They could unload a cattle boat in as little as 15 minutes. Some cattle, especially from Argentina, were very wild, and were best given \"a wide berth\". A man in regular employment could earn as much as \u00a34 a week (about \u00a3520 purchasing power in 2018 money). Slaughtermen.

No slaughtering was done on Saturdays; on other days it varied according to demand, and for a rush order might last up to 20 hours on end.  The work was said to be brutalising \"and conducive to drink\".A carefully aimed blow at the head with a poleaxe was the usual method of stunning used in Britain.

While not all American exports went to Deptford, London was the most important market.  Wrote John P. Huttman:The impact of foreign demand for U.S. meat, in which the British market figured so importantly, was reflected in the growth of the Western packinghouse industry, the expansion of railway traffic due to the movement of live and butchered animals, and the growth of livestock herds\". As noted, the trade became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.. Further, some British agriculturalists, shielded until recently from American competition \u2014 first by distance, then by quality issues \u2014 found it attractive to go in for American ranching themselves. They \"fought competition at its source and engaged directly in American ranching, until by 1884 it was estimated that 'one-sixth of all our herds are now owned by Englishmen'\".  And British investors, attracted by the fabulous profits sometimes realised in the West, made an important contribution to its development. From Canada. A major export industry at the time, range cattle came from Alberta and Assiniboia and went east on the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The St. Lawrence River route meant that cattle started the voyage in calm waters and comparatively cool weather. \"Most of the losses of cattle in shipments from Atlantic ports were due to delay and neglect prior to shipping and occurred during the first few days of the crossing\".  For many years Canadian livestock was considered disease-free and could be landed freely, but it was scheduled for slaughter at Deptford from 1892 on.  It did western ranchers little harm:The movement of high quality to the British market continued unabated. These great range-bred cattle had to be slaughtered within the port holding pens anyway, because they were too wild to ship conveniently to provincial butchers.Exports to England rose from 115,000 cattle in 1900 to 160,000 in 1905, but petered out after a severe winter depleted half the range-cattle industry's working capital.

As the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford's main supply of animals came from Argentina.  Formerly, Argentine cattle \"were of an inferior breed, their chief characteristics being thick hides and well-developed horns\"; they were slaughtered locally for their hides, bones and tallow. Two things transformed the Argentine beef industry into the greatest exporter in the world: selective breeding and alfalfa (lucerne) forage.From about 1888 live cattle and sheep were shipped as deck cargo from Buenos Aires, carpenters knocking up temporary stalls and pens.  Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.  Progressive Argentine cattlemen were keenly aware that quality was important, and they paid large prices for Shorthorn bulls to improve their herds.   Such was the demand for export-grade cattle in 1903 that an American agent told his government \"it is extremely difficult to get a good piece of beef in the city of Buenos Aires\".  \"Wild, untamed brutes\" did badly on the sea journey, and had to be tamed in advance and taught to eat hay.Deptford was closed to Argentine cattle and sheep in 1900 for foot-and-mouth, and briefly re-opened in 1903.  Thereafter there was scant incentive to revive the live meat trade on these very long journeys.  From about 1900 good chilled Argentine beef was a more satisfactory alternative. Severe unemployment came to Deptford. From Australia and New Zealand. At the end of the Victorian era cattle and sheep were shipped to Deptford Market from as far away as Victoria (Australia), New South Wales, Queensland, and Dunedin, New Zealand.. The first commercial (though experimental) shipment was from Sydney on the steamer Maori King, a 67-day voyage which went around Cape Horn in winter \u2014 presumably to avoid the heat of the Suez Canal.  The cattle landed at Deptford in September 1894, but sold at a heavy loss.  Next year there was a much more successful voyage by Port Pirie: one animal died of heat in the Red Sea, but the others arrived in excellent condition (see illustration).  Another success was 250 sheep per Banffshire from Dunedin; only one was lost.. However, as shipments continued there were \"terrible\" losses.  For these ambitious voyages more than halfway round the world, excellent planning and execution were essential, but were wanting. The Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, clapped an extinguisher on the trade. The vessel left the port on November 22, 1895, and arrived at Deptford on February 9, 1896, with 32 animals [alive], some of which were in a maimed condition. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took the matter up, and the Board of Agriculture inspected the ship and issued an order prohibiting the Angers from carrying live stock from or to any port in Great Britain for a twelvemonth.. Altogether in the Australasian live trade, 607 cattle were lost out of 2,654 shipped, and 57 out of 3,882 sheep. The Beef Trust. The Beef Trust was a cartel of the large Chicago meat packers.  Acting in collusion they allocated market shares and fixed meat prices in the United States, eventually coming under attack by \"trust buster\" president Theodore Roosevelt.  As described in the next section, by 1900 the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America.. In the Edwardian era reputable newspapers claimed that  the Trust had bought up many shops in Smithfield Market;. they met every morning to fix the price of British beef;. they practically controlled the lairages at Deptford Market; but. instead of selling their Deptford cattle to buyers at that market, they sent the meat directly to Smithfield; with the result that, on a numerous occasions, market days at Deptford were cancelled for lack of support.As a result of persistent questioning by C. W. Bowerman, Labour MP for Deptford, Winston Churchill (the President of the Board of Trade) set up an inquiry into \"how far and in what manner the general supply, distribution and price of Meat in the United Kingdom are controlled or affected by any combination of firms or companies\".  The inquiry reported in 1909.  The allegations were generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom.  This was because, although it did indeed control the North Atlantic meat trade, American beef exports had declined, and large shipments of refrigerated beef were coming from Argentina.

This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently \u2014 as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey..

Marijuana. A few months after his inauguration, Youngkin proposed that Virginia recriminalize possessing more than two ounces of marijuana. When the Northam administration, a year earlier, had legalized possessing up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia, it did so while establishing a system in which possessing between one ounce and one pound was made punishable by a $25 fine; possessing over one pound remained a felony. This system made Virginia the only US state to have legalized marijuana possession without having misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount. Youngkin's proposal to introduce such penalties in Virginia was inspired by a recommendation made in 2021 by the state legislature's nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.Under Youngkin's proposal, possessing more than two ounces of marijuana would become a Class 2 misdemeanor, while possessing more than six ounces would become a Class 1 misdemeanor. Before this proposal was made, the Democratic-controlled State Senate had passed a bill during the 2022 legislative session that would have made possessing more than four ounces of marijuana a Class 3 misdemeanor. That bill, which also would have legalized the sale of recreational marijuana in Virginia, was rejected by the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. Later that year, as part of a bipartisan budget deal signed by Youngkin, Virginia made possessing between four ounces and a pound of marijuana in public a Class 3 misdemeanor for a first time offense and a Class 2 misdemeanor for repeat offenses. This same budget deal banned the sale of cannabis products shaped as animals, humans, vehicles, or fruits, so as to protect against accidental consumption by children.Separate marijuana legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 allows patients to purchase medical marijuana immediately upon receiving a certificate to do so from a registered medical provider. Previously, patients were required to register with the State Board of Pharmacy before they could make such a purchase. This reform was enacted due to long wait times occurring during the registration process.Youngkin has also proposed raising the legal age for purchasing CBD products in Virginia to 21 and banning products that contain Delta-8 THC, which is described by The Washington Post as \"a hemp-derived compound that has become popular for its similarity to Delta-9, the main compound in marijuana that gives consumers a high. Voting rights. As governor, Youngkin has continued the work of restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell's immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam. Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences. An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam's final year in office, but amendments  to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum, and Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin's first year in office.In 2022, Youngkin signed bipartisan legislation requiring that the removal of deceased voters from Virginia's electoral rolls be conducted on a weekly basis; this had previously been done on a monthly basis. That same year, Youngkin signed legislation changing how absentee ballots are reported in Virginia. Previously, these ballots had been reported as part of a single, at-large precinct. Youngkin's legislation requires that they instead be reported precinct-by-precinct. Involvement in the 2022 federal midterms. During the 2022 federal elections, Youngkin campaigned frequently for Republicans in other states, supporting both candidates who had embraced Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election and those who had not. This led to The Washington Post writing that Youngkin had \"demonstrated uncommon flexibility on an issue that for others...represents a bright line.\" Youngkin's refusal to distance himself from conspiracy theorists within his own party has elicited criticism from some moderate Republicans, such as Liz Cheney, David Jolly, and Bill Kristol.Among the candidates Youngkin campaigned for during the midterms was former Maine governor Paul LePage, who was seeking a nonconsecutive third term in office. During his previous tenure as governor, LePage had drawn controversy for a series of comments that both Republican and Democratic politicians condemned as racist; these comments included LePage stating that \"the enemy right now...are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.\" Youngkin initially claimed to be unaware of these comments."}, {"summary_score": 0.8622337070798756, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8465671622301201, "text_rank": 10, "proposition": "Each of Youngkin's predecessors focused their first executive actions on less incendiary topics, such as anti-discrimination protections and policy studies.", "text": "Youngkin's stance on critical race theory has been condemned by leaders of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, and according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, has \"alarmed many educators\" in the state. Youngkin's critics, the publication wrote, view the banning of critical race theory as an attempt to \"whitewash\" history and \"erase black history\".Two of the executive actions signed by Youngkin on his first day in office rescinded COVID-19 regulations that had been enacted by the previous administration; one of these actions rescinded Virginia's statewide mask mandate for public schools and attempted to make compliance with local public school mask mandates optional; the other rescinded the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all state employees. Additionally, one of Youngkin's Day One executive orders called for a reevaluation of the workplace safety standards that had been adopted by the Northam administration as a protection against COVID-19.The other executive actions taken by Youngkin on his first day in office were devoted to firing and replacing the entire Virginia Parole Board, calling for the state's Attorney General to investigate the handling of sexual assaults that had recently occurred in the Loudoun County public school system, initiating reviews of the Virginia Parole Board, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Virginia Employment Commission, creating commissions to combat antisemitism and human trafficking, ordering state agencies under Youngkin's authority to reduce nonmandatory regulations by 25%, and calling for the state to reevaluate its membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.The Washington Post noted that Youngkin's first executive orders had gone \"far beyond the practice of his predecessors in the Executive Mansion over the past 20 years\", writing that while each of those predecessors had focused their first executive actions on \"less incendiary topics\", such as anti-discrimination protections and policy studies, Youngkin's first executive actions, \"by contrast...poked a stick directly into a host of polarizing issues\". Former Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Bill Bolling, a Republican, condemned Youngkin's repeal of public school mask mandates, saying that it introduced \"unnecessary controversy, confusion and litigation\" and calling it \"in direct conflict with an existing state law.\" The legality of Youngkin using an executive order to ban the teaching of critical race theory has also been called into question. VPM News reported that Youngkin's critics view the order as \"unenforceable\". The Washington Post noted that no governor had \"banned critical race theory via executive order\" before Youngkin and predicted that any such order would face court challenges, writing that it was \"not clear\" whether Youngkin would be exceeding his legal authority by issuing such an order. Lawsuits. Two lawsuits were brought in January against Youngkin's executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia. One of the lawsuits was brought by a group of parents from Chesapeake and the other was brought by seven of the state's school boards. The lawsuits argued that Youngkin's executive order infringed upon local control given to Virginia school boards by the state constitution and violated a state law requiring that Virginia public schools comply with CDCP health guidelines \"to the maximum extent practicable\". The ACLU, representing a group of medically vulnerable students in Virginia, brought an additional lawsuit in February, arguing that Youngkin's policy violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against students who would be at high risk if infected by COVID-19. Youngkin called on Virginia parents to cooperate with school principals while the lawsuits proceeded.A majority of public school districts in Virginia refused to comply with the executive order and continued to enforce local mask mandates into February. On February 4, an Arlington County judge ruled to allow mask mandates to be temporarily retained in the seven school districts that had sued to stop Youngkin's order while their case proceeded through the courts. Three days later, the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit brought by the group of parents from Chesapeake; the dismissal was for procedural reasons and did not rule on the legality of Youngkin's executive order, nor did it overturn the ruling that had been issued that week in Arlington County. The same day that the Chesapeake lawsuit was dismissed, the Youngkin administration joined a lawsuit against the Loudoun County school system, brought by a group of parents in that county, who were challenging their school system's decision to continue enforcing a mask mandate.School systems throughout Virginia began dropping their mask mandates in mid-February, after Youngkin signed a bill requiring that they do so by March 1. The ACLU expanded the scope of its lawsuit against the Youngkin administration to include this new law, and on March 23, 2022, a federal judge decided the lawsuit by ruling that school districts in Virginia could choose to require masking in areas frequented by the plaintiffs. The ruling did not overturn Youngkin's executive order or the state law and only applies to school systems attended by the plaintiffs."}]}, "correct": false}

Although education officials within the Northam administration explored the potential benefits of detracking students prior to the 11th grade, no plans to do so were ever adopted, and in April 2021, those officials explained that the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative was not designed to eliminate advanced math classes at any grade level. Shortly after Youngkin and other conservatives first began speaking out against the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative, The Washington Post reported that the actual nature of the program had been \"obscured...[by] prominent Virginians and copious coverage from right-wing news outlets\" as \"outrage built online\" among those opposed to it.In early April 2022, Youngkin signed a bill allowing school parents throughout Virginia to review and opt their children out of any educational material containing \"sexually explicit content\"; any opted out student would be provided with alternative material. This is the first statewide law in the nation allowing for parental review of sexually explicit content in school curriculum. Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\". The bill passed along mostly party lines. A similar bill, known as the \"Beloved Bill\", was vetoed by McAuliffe in both 2016 and 2017. That bill, which had originated when a conservative activist took issue with the inclusion of Beloved in her high school senior son's AP English class, became one of the focal points of Virginia's 2021 gubernatorial election, and reviving the bill was identified by The Washington Post as \"one of the key promises\" of Youngkin's campaign. The provisions of the bill will take effect in 2023.In May 2022, Youngkin sent a letter to the Council of Presidents overseeing Virginia colleges and universities, urging mandatory political diversity in their hiring practices. That year, he introduced a budget amendment, which succeeded in the General Assembly, requiring that the state's public colleges and universities promote \"free speech and diversity of thought on [their] campuses.\"In August 2022, Youngkin enlisted the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, to assist in revising Virginia's educational standards for history and social sciences.During the 2022 legislative session, Youngkin advocated for a bill that would have reversed reforms that had been recently adopted to the admissions processes at some Governor's Schools in Virginia, specifically at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria and at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. Although race blind, the reformed admissions processes achieved their goal by implementing an approach largely based on geographic and socioeconomic factors. The bill supported by Youngkin would have banned such an approach, characterizing the use of geographic and socioeconomic factors as \"proxy discrimination\". This bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but failed in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. A separate bill signed by Youngkin that same year bans Governor's Schools in Virginia \"from discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the process of admitting students to such school.\" This bill, which received bipartisan support, was described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as \"a watered-down version\" of Youngkin's preferred bill. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin \"has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law.\" Tipline for \"divisive practices\". During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools.

Youngkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies. According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education\". The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone\". Cultural issues and curriculum. Throughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state. Politifact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms. The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students.\" Critics of Youngkin noted that he sent his own children to private schools where resources promoting critical race theory have been recommended. Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as \"ground zero for Youngkin's victory\", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order \"targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students.\"This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as \"a dumbing down of standards\". Youngkin called the program a \"left-wing takeover of public education\", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes \u2013 a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign.

The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards.In his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.In April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"Additional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.Only a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards.

During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use.

Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year; this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance.

A methamphetamine trafficking network run by members and associates of the Hells Angels' Rochester chapter operating in Western New York from 2002 through July 9, 2010 was dismantled after an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Genesee County Sheriff's Office, the New York State Police, the City of Batavia Police Department, and the Village of LeRoy Police Department.

This was then followed by the Charlotte chapter, which was chartered on October 19, 1978, and was formed by Michael Franklin \"Thunder\" Finazzo \u2013 a member of the Hells Angels' elite \"Filthy Few\" from Omaha, Nebraska \u2013 and others. Charlotte was home to numerous motorcycle gangs at the time, including the Outlaws, but under Finazzo's leadership, the Hells Angels were able to take control of much of the city's criminal rackets and operated drug, prostitution and motorcycle theft rings throughout the state. During the Hells Angels' international rally held at a private campground on Kerr Lake on July 4, 1981, journalists covering the event for The Charlotte Observer were assaulted by Hells Angels members. Staff reporters Robin Clark and Tex O'Neill were punched and photographer Mark Sluder was forced to turn over his film at knifepoint. The attack was stopped when O'Neill alerted FBI agents who were also observing the rally. Michael Finazzo and his lieutenant Tyler Duris \"Yank\" Frndak were found shot dead and stuffed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile 88 in Randolph County on September 26, 1981. At the time, Finazzo was considered by police to be among the ten most powerful members of the club. Although the murders remain unsolved, police believe that the killings were related to a feud with the Outlaws or a power struggle within the Hells Angels. Club members from across the United States, as well as Canada, Denmark, England and the Netherlands, attended the burials of both men, which took place in Marshville on October 1, 1981.

Authorities then obtained warrants to search a storage unit in nearby Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they uncovered a booby-trapped stockpile of weapons consisting of C-4 explosive, grenades, ammunition and two fully-automatic submachine guns equipped with silencers. The ATF was called in to investigate the seizure, and an explosive ordnance disposal unit from the Fort Jackson Army base was required to disarm the trap.

Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.. After losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA.

The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed. Defining radio's golden age. NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included Vic and Sade, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve, One Man's Family, Ma Perkins and Death Valley Days. NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique clear-channel national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.. In the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers \u2013 including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra \u2013 jumped to CBS.. In addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theater on the network became television's first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of simulcasting. Two of the concerts were historic firsts \u2013 the first complete telecast of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and the first complete telecast of Verdi's Aida (starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.. Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, The Big Show's initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell advertising time during the middle half-hour of the program each week)..

Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures.

Renaissance culture meant a return to rationalism, the study of nature, empirical research, with a special influence of classical Greco-Roman philosophy. Theology took a back seat and the object of study of the philosopher returned to the human being (humanism).In the Renaissance, the use of canvas as a support and the technique of oil painting became widespread, especially in Venice from 1460. Oil painting provided a greater chromatic richness and facilitated the representation of brightness and light effects, which could be represented in a wider range of shades. In general, Renaissance light tended to be intense in the foreground, diminishing progressively towards the background. It was a fixed lighting, which meant an abstraction with respect to reality, since it created an aseptic space subordinated to the idealizing character of Renaissance painting; to reconvert this ideal space into a real atmosphere, a slow process was followed based on the subordination of volumetric values to lighting effects, through the dissolution of the solidity of forms in the luminous space.. During this period, chiaroscuro was recovered as a method to give relief to objects, while the study of gradation as a technique to diminish the intensity of color and modeling to graduate the different values of light and shadow was deepened. Renaissance natural light not only determined the space of the pictorial composition, but also the volume of figures and objects. It is a light that loses the metaphorical character of Gothic light and becomes a tool for measuring and ordering reality, shaping a plastic space through a naturalistic representation of light effects. Even when light retains a metaphorical reference \u2014 in religious scenes \u2014 it is a light subordinated to the realistic composition.Light had a special relevance in landscape painting, a genre in which it signified the transition from a symbolic representation in medieval art to a naturalistic transcription of reality. Light is the medium that unifies all parts of the composition into a structured and coherent whole. According to Kenneth Clark, \"the sun shines for the first time in the landscape of the Flight into Egypt that Gentile da Fabriano painted in his Adoration of 1423. This sun is a golden disk, which is reminiscent of medieval symbolism, but its light is already fully naturalistic, spilling over the hillside, casting shadows and creating the compositional space of the image.. In the Renaissance, the first theoretical treatises on the representation of light in painting appeared: Leonardo da Vinci dedicated a good part of his Treatise on Painting to the scientific study of light. Albrecht D\u00fcrer investigated a mathematical procedure to determine the location of shadows cast by objects illuminated by point source lights, such as candlelight. Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo devoted the fourth book of his Trattato (1584) to light, in which he arranged light in descending order from primary sunlight, divine light and artificial light to the weaker secondary light reflected by illuminated bodies. Cennino Cennini took up in his treatise Il libro dell'arte the rule of Philoponus on the creation of distance by contrasts: \"the farther away you want the mountains to appear, the darker you will make your color; and the closer you want them to appear, the lighter you will make the colors\".Another theoretical reference was Leon Battista Alberti, who in his treatise De pictura (1435) pointed out the indissolubility of light and color, and affirmed that \"philosophers say that no object is visible if it is not illuminated and has no color. Therefore they affirm that between light and color there is a great interdependence, since they make themselves reciprocally visible\". In his treatise, Alberti pointed out three fundamental concepts in painting: circumscriptio (drawing, outline), compositio (arrangement of the elements), and luminum receptio (illumination). He stated that color is a quality of light and that to color is to \"give light\" to a painting. Alberti pointed out that relief in painting was achieved by the effects of light and shadow (lumina et umbrae), and warned that \"on the surface on which the rays of light fall the color is lighter and more luminous, and that the color becomes darker where the strength of the light gradually diminishes.\" Likewise, he spoke of the use of white as the main tool for creating brilliance: \"the painter has nothing but white pigment (album colorem) to imitate the flash (fulgorem) of the most polished surfaces, just as he has nothing but black to represent the most extreme darkness of the night."}, {"summary_score": 0.8542598349794044, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8488188599531379, "text_rank": 6, "proposition": "In his Treatise on Painting (1540), Leonardo da Vinci stated that painting is the sum of light and darkness (chiaroscuro).", "text": "The Renaissance saw the emergence of the sfumato technique, traditionally attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which consisted of the degradation of light tones to blur the contours and thus give a sense of remoteness. This technique was intended to give greater verisimilitude to the pictorial representation, by creating effects similar to those of human vision in environments with a wide perspective. The technique consisted of a progressive application of glazes and the feathering of the shadows to achieve a smooth gradient between the various parts of light and shadow of the painting, with a tonal gradation achieved with progressive retouching, leaving no trace of the brushstroke. It is also called \"aerial perspective\", since its results resemble the vision in a natural environment determined by atmospheric and environmental effects. This technique was used, in addition to Leonardo, by D\u00fcrer, Giorgione and Bernardino Luini, and later by Vel\u00e1zquez and other Baroque painters.. Leonardo was essentially concerned with perception, the observation of nature. He sought life in painting, which he found in color, in the light of chromaticism. In his Treatise on Painting (1540) he stated that painting is the sum of light and darkness (chiaroscuro), which gives movement, life: according to Leonardo, darkness is the body and light is the spirit, and the mixture of both is life. In his treatise he established that \"painting is a composition of light and shadows, combined with the various qualities of all the simple and compound colors\". He also distinguished between illumination (lume) and brilliance (lustro), and warned that \"opaque bodies with hard and rough surface never generate luster in any illuminated part\".. The Florentine polymath included light among the main components of painting and pointed it out as an element that articulates pictorial representation and conditions the spatial structure and the volume and chromaticism of objects and figures. He was also concerned with the study of shadows and their effects, which he analyzed together with light in his treatise. He also distinguished between shadow (ombra) and darkness (tenebre), the former being an oscillation between light and darkness. He also studied nocturnal painting, for which he recommended the presence of fire as a means of illumination, and he wrote down the different necessary gradations of light and color according to the distance from the light source. Leonardo was one of the first artists to be concerned with the degree of illumination of the painter's studio, suggesting that for nudes or carnations the studio should have uncovered lights and red walls, while for portraits the walls should be black and the light diffused by a canopy.. Leonardo's subtle chiaroscuro effects are perceived in his female portraits, in which the shadows fall on the faces as if submerging them in a subtle and mysterious atmosphere. In these works he advocated intermediate lights, stating that \"the contours and figures of dark bodies are poorly distinguished in the dark as well as in the light, but in the intermediate zones between light and shadow they are better perceived\". Likewise, on color he wrote that \"colors placed in shadows will participate to a greater or lesser degree in their natural beauty according as they are placed in greater or lesser darkness. But if the colors are placed in a luminous space, then they will possess a beauty all the greater the more splendorous the luminosity\".. Look at the light and consider its beauty. Blink and look at it again: what you now see of the light was not there before and what was there before no longer exists.. The other great name of the early Cinquecento was Raphael, a serene and balanced artist whose work shows a certain idealism framed in a realistic technique of great virtuoso execution. According to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, Raphael \"has given enchanting, loving and sweet light, so that his figures appear beautiful, pleasing and intricate in their contours, and endowed with such relief that they seem to move.\" Some of his lighting solutions were quite innovative, with resources halfway between Leonardo and Caravaggio, as seen in The Transfiguration (1517-1520, Vatican Museums, Vatican City), in which he divides the image into two halves, the heavenly and the earthly, each with different pictorial resources. In the Liberation of Saint Peter (1514, Vatican Museums, Vatican City) he painted a nocturnal scene in which the light radiating from the angel in the center stands out, giving a sensation of depth, while at the same time it is reflected in the breastplates of the guards, creating intense luminous effects."}]}, "correct": false}

Another symbolism related to light is that which identifies Jesus with the Sun and Mary as the Dawn that precedes him. In addition to all this, in Christianity light can also signify truth, virtue and salvation. In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be \"plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity\". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called \"illumination\".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a \"real aspect of divinity,\" according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires.. In Christian iconography, light is also present in the halos of the saints, which used to be made \u2014especially in medieval art \u2014 with a golden nimbus, a circle of light placed around the heads of saints, angels and members of the Holy Family. In Fra Angelico's The Annunciation, in addition to the halo, the artist placed rays of light radiating from the figure of the archangel Gabriel, to emphasize his divinity, the same resource he uses with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. On other occasions, it is God himself who is represented in the form of rays of sunlight, as in The Baptism of Christ (1445) by Piero della Francesca. The rays can also signify God's wrath, as in The Tempest (1505) by Giorgione. On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects \u2014 generally made with gold leaf \u2014 was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death. Descartes spoke of an \"inner light\" capable of capturing the \"eternal truths\", a concept also taken up by Leibniz, who distinguished between lumi\u00e8re naturelle (natural light) and lumi\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e (revealed light).In the 19th century light was related by the German Romantics (Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) to nature, in a pantheistic sense of communion with nature. For Schelling, light was a medium in which the \"universal soul\" (Weltseele) moved. For Hegel, light was the \"ideality of matter\", the foundation of the material world.Between the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed."}, {"summary_score": 0.8386329075183843, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7938361723019809, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "The light from the angel in The Liberation of Saint Peter is reflected in the breastplates of the guards.", "text": "According to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, Raphael \"has given enchanting, loving and sweet light, so that his figures appear beautiful, pleasing and intricate in their contours, and endowed with such relief that they seem to move.\" Some of his lighting solutions were quite innovative, with resources halfway between Leonardo and Caravaggio, as seen in The Transfiguration (1517-1520, Vatican Museums, Vatican City), in which he divides the image into two halves, the heavenly and the earthly, each with different pictorial resources.

This was perhaps the first work to include artificial lighting with a naturalistic sense: the light radiating from the angel influences the illumination of the surrounding objects, while diluting the distant forms.. Outside Italy, Albrecht D\u00fcrer was especially concerned with light in his watercolor landscapes, treated with an almost topographical detail, in which he shows a special delicacy in the capture of light, with poetic effects that prelude the sentimental landscape of Romanticism. Albrecht Altdorfer showed a surprising use of light in The Battle of Alexander at Issos (1529, Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the appearance of the sun among the clouds produces a supernatural refulgence, effects of bubbling lights that also precede Romanticism. Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald was a solitary and melancholic artist, whose original work reflects a certain mysticism in the treatment of religious themes, with an emotive and expressionist style, still with medieval roots. His main work was the altar of Isenheim (1512-1516, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar), in which the refulgent halo in which he places his Risen Christ stands out. Between Gothic and Renaissance is the unclassifiable work of Bosch, a Flemish artist gifted with a great imagination, author of dreamlike images that continue to surprise for their fantasy and originality. In his works \u2014 and especially in his landscape backgrounds \u2014 there is a great skill in the use of light in different temporal and environmental circumstances, but he also knew how to recreate in his infernal scenes fantastic effects of flames and fires, as well as supernatural lights and other original effects, especially in works such as The Last Judgment (c. 1486-1510, Groenige Museum, Bruges), Visions of the Beyond (c. 1490, Doge's Palace, Venice), The Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1500-1505, Museo del Prado, Madrid), The Hay Chariot (c. 1500-1502, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or The Temptations of Saint Anthony (c. 1501, Museum of Fine Arts, Lisbon). Bosch had a predilection for the effects of light generated by fire, by the glow of flames, which gave rise to a new series of paintings in which the effects of violent and fantastic lights originated by fire stood out, as is denoted in a work by an anonymous artist linked to the workshop of Lucas van Leyden, Lot and his daughters (c. 1530, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), or in some works by Joachim Patinir, such as Charon crossing the Styx Lagoon (c. 1520-1524, Museo del Prado, Madrid) or Landscape with the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (c. 1520, Boymans Van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam). These effects also influenced Giorgione, as well as some Mannerist painters such as Lorenzo Lotto, Dosso Dossi and Domenico Beccafumi. Mannerism. At the end of the High Renaissance, in the middle of the 16th century, Mannerism followed, a movement that abandoned nature as a source of inspiration to seek a more emotional and expressive tone, in which the artist's subjective interpretation of the work of art became more important, with a taste for sinuous and stylized form, with deformation of reality, distorted perspectives and gimmicky atmospheres. In this style light was used in a gimmicky way, with an unreal treatment, looking for a colored light of different origins, both a cold moonlight and a warm firelight. Mannerism broke with the full Renaissance light by introducing night scenes with intense chromatic interplay between light and shadow and a dynamic rhythm far from Renaissance harmony."}]}, "correct": true}

One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and Jos\u00e9 de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action..

One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and Jos\u00e9 de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action..

An admirer of Velazquez's light, he knew how to apply it to the Castilian landscape \u2014 especially the mountains of Madrid \u2014 with his own personal style. Regoyos also trained with Haes and developed an intimate style halfway between pointillism and expressionism. Luminism and symbolism. From the mid-19th century until practically the transition to the 20th century, various styles emerged that placed special emphasis on the representation of light, which is why they were generically referred to as \"luminism\", with various national schools in the United States and various European countries or regions. The term luminism was introduced by John Ireland Howe Baur in 1954 to designate the landscape painting done in the United States between 1840 and 1880, which he defines as \"a polished and meticulous realism in which there are no noticeable brushstrokes and no trace of impressionism, and in which atmospheric effects are achieved by infinitely careful gradations of tone, by the most exact study of the relative clarity of nearer and more distant objects, and by an accurate rendering of the variations of texture and color produced by direct or reflected rays\".The first was American Luminism, which gave rise to a group of landscape painters generally grouped in the so-called Hudson River School, in which we can include to a greater or lesser extent Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Martin Johnson Heade, Fitz Henry Lane, John Frederick Kensett, James Augustus Suydam, Francis Augustus Silva, Jasper Francis Cropsey and George Caleb Bingham. In general, his works were based on bombastic compositions, with a horizon line of great depth and a sky of veiled aspect, with atmospheres of strong expressiveness. His light is serene and peaceful, reflecting a mood of love for nature, a nature largely in the United States of the time virgin and paradisiacal, yet to be explored. It is a transcendent light, of spiritual significance, whose radiance conveys a message of communion with nature. Although they use a classical structure and composition, the treatment of light is original because of the infinity of subtle variations in tonality, achieved through a meticulous study of the natural environment of their country. According to Barbara Novak, Luminism is a more serene form of the romantic aesthetic concept of the sublime, which had its translation in the deep expanses of the North American landscape.. Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting: in the former, the landscape \u2014 more centered in the New England area \u2014 is more peaceful, more anecdotal, with delicate tonal gradations characterized by a crystalline light that seems to emanate from the canvas, in neat brushstrokes that seem to recreate the surface of a mirror and in compositions in which the excess of detail is unreal due to its straightness and geometrism, resulting in an idealization of nature. Thus understood, Luminism would encompass Heade, Lane, Kensett, Suydam and Silva. Hudson River landscape painting, on the other hand, would have a more cosmic vision and a predilection for a wilder and more grandiloquent nature, with more dramatic visual effects, as seen in the work of Cole, Durand, Church, Bierstadt, Cropsey and Bingham. It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving \"an elevated style of landscape\" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting.

Giovanni Segantini, a personal artist who combined a drawing of academicist tradition with a post-impressionist coloring where the light effects have a great relief. Segantini's specialty was the mountain landscape, which he painted outdoors, with a technique of strong brushstrokes and simple colors, with a vibrant light that he only found in the high alpine mountains. In Germany, impressionism was represented by Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt. The first was more of a plenairist than strictly an impressionist, although more than landscape painting he devoted himself to genre painting, especially of religious themes, works in which he also showed a special sensitivity to light. Corinth had a rather eclectic career, from academic beginnings \u2014 he was a disciple of Bouguereau \u2014 through realism and impressionism, to a certain decadentism and an approach to Jugendstil, to finally end up in expressionism. Influenced by Rembrandt and Rubens, he painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes with a serene and brilliant chromatism. Slevogt assumed the fresh and brilliant chromatism of the Impressionists, although renouncing the fragmentation of colors that they made, and his technique was of loose brushstrokes and energetic movement, with bold and original light effects, which denote a certain influence of the baroque art of his native Bavaria.. In Great Britain, the work of James Abbott McNeil Whistler, American by birth but established in London since 1859, stood out. His landscapes are the antithesis of the sunny French landscapes, as they recreate the foggy and taciturn English climate, with a preference for night scenes, images from which he nevertheless knows how to distill an intense lyricism, with artificial light effects reflected in the waters of the Thames.In the United States, it is worth mentioning the work of John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam. Sargent was an admirer of Vel\u00e1zquez and Frans Hals, and excelled as a social portraitist, with a virtuoso and elegant technique, both in oil and watercolor, the latter mainly in landscapes of intense color. Cassatt lived for a long time in Paris, where he was related to the Impressionist circle, with whom he shared more the themes than the technique, and developed an intimate and sophisticated work, influenced by Japanese prints. Hassam's main motif was New York life, with a fresh but somewhat cloying style.. Mention should also be made of Scandinavian impressionism, many of whose artists were trained in Paris. These painters had a special sensitivity to light, perhaps due to its absence in their native land, so they traveled to France and Italy attracted by the \"light of the south\". The main exponents were Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, and Anders Zorn. The former showed a special interest in highly complex lighting effects, such as the mixing of natural and artificial light. Gallen-Kallela was an original artist who later approached symbolism, with a personal expressive and stylized painting with a tendency towards romanticism, with a special interest in Finnish folklore. Zorn specialized in portraits, nudes and genre scenes, with a brilliant brushstroke of vibrant luminosity.. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin should be mentioned. Serov had a style similar to that of Manet or Renoir, with a taste for intense chromatism and light reflections, a bright light that extols the joy of life. Korovin painted both urban landscapes \u2014 Parisian street scenes \u2014 and natural landscapes \u2014 summer images in Crimea \u2014 in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art.

The disco was noted for the lack of problems or incidents and as a meeting place of the children from the wealthy families (\"working class youth almost couldn't be seen in it\").

At the opening night, state and military top officials and members of the diplomatic corps were present. The caviar was served from the Josip Broz Tito's plates.

The largest arch of the aqueduct was named Skadar, so in 1872 the street was named Skadarska Street.Soon after the aqueduct was built, the first khans, precursors of later kafanas, were built along the foothill of the wall. Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901 and demolition of \"Dardaneli\". In the early 20the century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: \"Tri \u0161e\u0161ira\", \"Dva jelena\", \"Zlatni bokal\", \"Bandist\", \"East\", \"Guild\", \"Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107\", \"Bums Keler\", \"Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107\", \"The Two Sergeants\" and \"Mala Pijaca\". The first three still exist, accompanied by newer restaurants like \"Ima dana\" [There Will Be Days], \"Skadarlija\" or \"Dva bela goluba\". In the late 19th century, \"Pa\u0161onin Bulevar\" at the beginning of the street, was the very first Belgrade's music hall.The renovation and restoration of Skadarlija began in 1968 in accordance with the designs made by the group of prominent artists. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduced modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of young and bohemian artists. Since 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a \"bohemian flag\". There is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. It includes the types of dishes on the menus, types of uniforms, table clothes or music allowed, and the knowledge of foreign languages. The symbol of Skadarlija is a Fedora hat, mentioned in numerous folk songs, especially the in the starogradska musical style, a form of older urban folk music,  another emblematic feature of Skadarlija.After decades of performing in restaurants and outdoors, some performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers Toma Zdravkovi\u0107, Silvana Armenuli\u0107, Olga Jan\u010devecka. Especially popular was Sofka Nikoli\u0107. The first folk music star of newly formed Yugoslavia in the 1920s and 1930s, she published dozens of records, becoming one of the most commercial female singers in Europe. Musicians from Europe and United States were visiting her in Skadarlija, including Josephine Baker, who befriended her."}, {"summary_score": 0.8675912377996197, "proposition_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7774662448753523, "text_rank": 0, "proposition": "Street prostitution developed in Belgrade in the late 1960s, with sex workers operating on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge.", "text": "Having large number of people in one place, hospitality and catering services developed around the zone, and numerous kafanas were opened: \"Kod zlatnog krsta\", \"Kod zlatnog to\u010dka\", \"Kod cara\", \"Kod zlatnog slona\", \"Kod zlatnog sunca\", etc. Modern period. After World War II, night life dwindled. City was heavily damaged, population was cut by half, and it took a while to establish a proper public transportation grid to allow the commuting. Apart from the surviving \"legends\", new kafanas which became centers of night life in the 1950s-1960s were adjoined to the sports clubs and stadiums, like \"Mladi Proleter\", \"Sin\u0111eli\u0107\", \"Obili\u0107\" or \"Stadion\". Clientele often included footballers and other athletes. Another hub of night life included riverbank kafanas held by the fishermen, especially in Zemun. Popular entertainment and technological progress also hampered the importance of kafanas. Radio Belgrade began airing non-stop, including immensely popular comedy shows which emptied the streets, like the Joyful Evening (Veselo ve\u010de). In 1958 the broadcast of the Television Belgrade began.In the mid-1950s, renovated \"Lotos Bar\" was opened in Zmaj Jovina Street. A basement venue, it offered \"artistic program\" which included magicians, unicycle drivers, jugglers, fire eaters and, as the main attraction, barely dressed female dancers. It became instant sensation. As members of the new Communists political establishment became regular visitors and the bar slipped from not-so-hidden striptease club into the, also not-so-hidden prostitution locale, the working hours were constantly extended. In order to repeal the common people, the entry prices, and especially drinks, skyrocketed. Similar venues soon followed: \"Kristal Bar\", bars in the \"Ma\u017eestik\" and \"Metropol\" hotels, and numerous striptease clubs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, all were closed.The street prostitution developed since the late 1960s. The sex workers operated on the access roads to the Pan\u010devo Bridge and became known as stoperke (\"hitchhiker girls\"). As a result, a row of inns was built along the Pan\u010devo and Zrenjanin roads. Another long surviving location was the Economy Faculty's Park, where gay and transsexual prostitution also developed. The park earned a moniker Picin park [Pussy Park], while the prostitutes were nicknamed kamenjarke (\"stone walkers\") after the nearby Kameni\u010dka Street. Transgender sex worker Vjeran Miladinovi\u0107 Merlinka became a celebrity in the 1990s. Another location, which in time became synonymous for prostitution was Plavi most (\"Blue Bridge\") across the highway between Konjarnik and Medakovi\u0107. Old style brothels also continued, followed in the 1990s by the porn-shops and business escort agencies, some located even in Skadarlija. Since the 2010s, some elite prostitutes became reality TV stars, called \"starlets\", though they were continuously getting arrested for prostitution.New Belgrade, built across the Sava in earnest from 1948, notoriously had no night life, as for the long time it had no kafanas. Exceptions were \"Fontana\" in the neighborhood of the same name, \"Pri Majolka\", later renamed \"Vojvodina\", in the shopping mall \"Old Merkator\", and the oldest \"D\u017eakarta\", across the Studentski Grad, better known by its original and present name \"To\u0161in Bunar\".As the first kafana on the boat, \"Split\" has historical importance as the precursor of splavovi. The restaurant was opened in 1970, but the ship was much older. On the orders of the Serbian Royal Navy Society, it was built in 1892 in Regensburg, Germany, as the luxurious paddle steamer, and originally named Emperor Nicholas II. It was sent mostly on diplomatic missions, like International Danube Commission. It was part of the ill-fated Kladovo transport in World War II. After the war it was renamed Split, docked under the Branko's Bridge, and adapted into the restaurant. The steerage was adapted into the private rooms and used for prostitution, so the police often raided the venue. The ship  is since 1992 on the dry dock in Kladovo, being declared a cultural monument in 2006.In time kafanas evolved into the westernized restaurants, but many traditional ones survived, and remained part of Belgrade's tourist offer."}]}, "correct": false}

By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS (\"vocal-instrumental band\").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it.

The use of excessive violence by police officers has been a major concern in Italy since the 2000s. Beatings and violence are commonly used during demonstrations, and several murders have been carried out.. The following incidents caused concern in the country: On 11 July 2001, 23-year-old student Carlo Giuliani was killed by police officers when they opened fire on a group of protesters during the anti-globalization demonstration outside the July 2001 G8 summit. 25-year-old police officer Mario Placanica was considered to be responsible for Giuliani's death but was not charged. Placanica asserted that he was being used as a scapegoat to cover up for the responsible parties and that other officers caused Giuliani's death, shooting at Giuliani from a nearby location. Nobody was arrested for Giuliani's murder.. On 11 July 2003, Marcello Lonzi, aged 29, was beaten and tortured to death in his cell. Lonzi was arrested in the city of Livorno four months prior, as he was suspected of carrying out an attempted theft. Although his death was considered to be caused by \"a heart attack after a fall\", signs of torture were found on his body. Nobody was arrested for Lonzi's death.. On 25 September 2005 in Ferrara, at around 5 a.m., a woman called police claiming that she saw \"a strange man walking around\". The man, 18-year-old Federico Aldrovandi, who had spent the night in Bologna before returning to Ferrara, was stopped by four policemen. The four officers then began to beat and torture Aldrovandi, killing him at the scene. The officers were arrested and sentenced to three years and six months in prison.. On 27 October 2007 in Trieste, 34-year-old schizophrenic Riccardo Rasman was launching firecrackers to celebrate his recent employment as a waste collector. Police were called by a resident as he heard suspected shots (which were the firecrackers' noise). Four police officers stormed the house, beating Rasman. The man was hit with iron objects and gagged. The officer pressed their knee on his neck and back, causing Rasman to die of asphyxia. The four officers were sentenced to just six months of prison.. On 14 October 2007 in Pietralunga, 44-year-old carpenter Aldo Bianzino and his wife, Roberta Radici, were arrested for a handful of marijuana plants at their home. Bianzino stated that the plants were for personal use. When the couple arrived at a police station, they were separated. Two days later, an officer approached Radici in her cell and asked her if her husband has heart problems. Radici responded that Aldo never had health issues and was in good condition, and demanded to know why the officer had asked her the question. The officer responded that Aldo Bianzino had been brought to the hospital in serious condition. Three hours later, Radici was freed from her cell and inquired as to when she could see Aldo. The officer callously responded: \"after the autopsy.\" During Bianzino's autopsy, several signs of violence emerged, including broken ribs, damage to the liver and spleen, and several bruises. A policeman was sentenced in 2015 to a year in prison for lack of assistance. Roberta Radici died of cancer in 2008..

The protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. The protests are still commonly affected by police brutality around the time of the event. On 17 November 1985 another protestor, 15-year-old Michalis Kaltezas, was murdered by the police during the demonstration commemorating the Polytechnic uprising.The level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years have been profound. Due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. Greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.In 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. It was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the police's press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection\u2014Nikos Dendias\u2014supported the police and claimed that they needed to use Photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable. In October 2012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party (and later deemed a criminal organization) \"Golden Dawn\". Victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the Attica General Police Directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. Dendias countered by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on The Guardian report the next day were fired.Police brutality in Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill-treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which took place on 17 November 2014. Allegations against police have emerged specifically concerning their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range \u2013 in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in the hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they laughed.Video footage confirmed that on 13 November 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings. Amnesty International called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of \"abuse and impunity\" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.A German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. The student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable..
