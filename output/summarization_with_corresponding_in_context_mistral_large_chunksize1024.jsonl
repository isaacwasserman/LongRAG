They opted for a steel polyhedron case and mounted the painting on a distant wall to avoid reflection issues. The display was well-received by some, but others had reservations. In 1992, the painting was moved to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. Picardo, elected to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1997, gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores in 2000 and was awarded the Premio Antonio Camu\u00f1as de Arquitectura in 2001.

The decision was therefore made to install the painting some distance away from the main sheet of glass, so that the metal frame of the glass would not infringe on the view of the image. The solution for the display was to build an armoured glass and steel polyhedron case whose bevels, for full security, would meet the floor, the walls and the ceiling around the picture. The main glass itself was set at 10 degrees to the vertical to avoid reflections. The sources of illumination would be within the case. The size of the room in which the picture was displayed \u2014 a large high space originally created as a ballroom \u2014 allowed the whole canvas to be viewed from 25 metres away.Guernica was installed in September 1981 and the room opened to the public on 25 October that year, Picasso's centenary. Within a year, over one million people had seen Guernica in its new Picardo/de Paredes setting. Opinions of the method of display differed. The artist's daughter, Paloma Picasso, applauded the location and the method of display, as did Spanish artist Josep Renau. Catalan architect, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, described it as \"magnificent\". The British art critic and collector, Douglas Cooper, wrote that the painting was \"admirably lit, there being no shadows, no reflections and no distortions.\" He went on: \"Never in its history has Guernica been displayed so beautifully or so entirely to its advantage.\" Others were not so convinced. It was reported that the fact the installation was built by the technicians of the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes rather than by the Prado's own staff brought practical difficulties. And British art critic, David Sylvester, maintained years later that when Guernica was returned to Spain in 1981 \"it was hung in an annexe to the Prado, where by common consent it was not seen to advantage.\"In 1992 Guernica was controversially moved from the Museo Nacional del Prado (where Picasso had wanted the painting to be permanently displayed) to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. The Picardo/Garc\u00eda de Paredes display installation is no longer in use. Election to the Real Academia. On 3 February 1997, at the age of 78, Picardo was elected Academician of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), being proposed by Julio Cano Lasso, Fernando Chueca Goitia and Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. He entered the Academy on 22 February 1998 with a speech entitled Hip\u00f3lito, the composition and delivering of an address having been established as one of the requirements after being elected Academician. In it he talked of two of his passions: architecture and the horse. \"The horse is an animal that surpasses the human body in beauty, strength and speed,\" Picardo claimed. \"... and architecture, in turn, is the art that protects this human body and enables and exalts it.\" He confessed that it was impossible for him to decide between architectural beauty and equine beauty because both \"son perfecciones\" (are perfections).In 2000 Picardo gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores, an image of five policemen mounted on five horses in a compact group. The academy observes the complicated juego (game) of the twenty horses' legs of different colours and in different positions seemingly almost entwined.The academy also houses in its collection a portrait of Picardo by Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez.

The castle, built in the 13th century, had been abandoned and was in disrepair. Picardo decided to build the Parador on the site of the old barracks and stables, rather than in the castle itself, to take advantage of the views and avoid altering the castle's original structure. The first phase of the Parador, completed in 1965, included a dining room, lounge, service areas, and 7 double guest rooms, with additional rooms and facilities added in later phases. Picardo designed the building to resemble the castle, using modern materials hidden beneath traditional stone, brick, timber, and iron. He also added 24 guest rooms in a westward extension in 1973, bringing the total to 43 and elevating the building to the title of Parador. The interior was designed to continue the medieval ambiance, with furniture, wall-hangings, and other details created by Picardo.", "text": "He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador."}, {"summary_score": 0.8857213780246959, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8610030946941833, "text_rank": 10, "summary": "Picardo, the architect known for his work on Paradores, improved the castle-turned-Parador in Ciudad Rodrigo in 1975.

Despite contemporary criticism, his Paradores, such as those in Ja\u00e9n, Carmona, and Sig\u00fcenza, remain popular. Besides Paradores, Picardo also restored various historical buildings, including Catedral de C\u00e1diz, Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana, Palacio de Gamazo, Castillo de San Felipe, and Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca.", "text": "In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Controversial legacy of Picardo's Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo's work at Sig\u00fcenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects' objective as being escenograf\u00eda convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached \u2014 Picardo's Parador at J\u00e4en is a good example \u2014 she has described them as being \"falso hist\u00f3rico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo's defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art). Picardo himself maintained: \"El Arte es eterno ...\"(Art is eternal ...), \"...it is always current. The reconstructions of the castles are really false. If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo's artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\" He goes on to say that faced with the dilemma of adopting a \"mimetic and conservative attitude or a more modern and disruptive approach\", Picardo claimed supremacy for Art. \"En Arte todo es posible\" (In Art everything is possible), wrote Picardo in 1994. \"A good architect will know how to weigh up both solutions and his sensitivity shall dictate his choice.\"Despite the current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores \u2014 particularly those at J\u00e4en, Carmona and Sig\u00fcenza \u2014 though pastiche, remain amongst the most popular of the network's hotels. One United States travel writer enthused about J\u00e4en: \"I love this parador, so dramatic in its setting, so theatrically conceived ... Inside, the deception is masterly, creating an ambience as old and austere as it is surrealistic and extravagant.\" Other historical restorations. Demonstrating his educated and precise knowledge of classical styles, during his career Picardo carried out restoration works on the Catedral de C\u00e1diz, deleteriously affected by salt from being near the sea, the Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, the Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, damaged during the Civil War, and in the tiny Ermita del Humilladero in the Sierra de Villuercas. He rehabilitated the Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana (also known as Palacio Domecq) in Jerez, rebuilt the Palacio de Gamazo in Madrid which had been partially demolished three years before, restored the Castillo de San Felipe in Puerto de la Cruz de Tenerife and in his last project worked on the Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca in the old centre of the city in 1995.

Other Parador projects. In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of M\u00e9rida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monz\u00f3n, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Catalu\u00f1a and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Catalu\u00f1a.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Ant\u00f3n at A Coru\u00f1a in 1968, the Posada del Cord\u00f3n at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del De\u00e1n and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia.

Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbar\u00e1n. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gram\u00e1tica, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Cat\u00e1logo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de inter\u00e9s nacional hist\u00f3rico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an \"outstanding\" staircase, and to return them to their original Mud\u00e9jar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mud\u00e9jar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina.

Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo's work at Sig\u00fcenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects' objective as being escenograf\u00eda convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached \u2014 Picardo's Parador at J\u00e4en is a good example \u2014 she has described them as being \"falso hist\u00f3rico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo's defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art). Picardo himself maintained: \"El Arte es eterno ...\"(Art is eternal ...), \"...it is always current. The reconstructions of the castles are really false. If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo's artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\" He goes on to say that faced with the dilemma of adopting a \"mimetic and conservative attitude or a more modern and disruptive approach\", Picardo claimed supremacy for Art. \"En Arte todo es posible\" (In Art everything is possible), wrote Picardo in 1994. \"A good architect will know how to weigh up both solutions and his sensitivity shall dictate his choice.\"Despite the current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores \u2014 particularly those at J\u00e4en, Carmona and Sig\u00fcenza \u2014 though pastiche, remain amongst the most popular of the network's hotels. One United States travel writer enthused about J\u00e4en: \"I love this parador, so dramatic in its setting, so theatrically conceived ... Inside, the deception is masterly, creating an ambience as old and austere as it is surrealistic and extravagant.\" Other historical restorations. Demonstrating his educated and precise knowledge of classical styles, during his career Picardo carried out restoration works on the Catedral de C\u00e1diz, deleteriously affected by salt from being near the sea, the Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, the Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, damaged during the Civil War, and in the tiny Ermita del Humilladero in the Sierra de Villuercas. He rehabilitated the Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana (also known as Palacio Domecq) in Jerez, rebuilt the Palacio de Gamazo in Madrid which had been partially demolished three years before, restored the Castillo de San Felipe in Puerto de la Cruz de Tenerife and in his last project worked on the Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca in the old centre of the city in 1995.

With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces' types.

The book is long out of print and virtually unknown in Spain, and not at all elsewhere, but is available second-hand. Paradores de Turismo. From the early 1960s to 1985 Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a. He had for some time carried out minor work for the Ministerio de Informaci\u00f3n y Turismo which controlled the hotel network. For the purposes of tourism the Ministry and its forebears had for over 30 years rehabilitated rundown and sometimes ruined historic buildings such as castles and convents and converted them into luxury hotels in a style that went beyond ordinary hotel use. In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required.. A wealth of Picardo's drawings for his Paradores projects survive. There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations.

This interest in historical architecture shaped Picardo's work throughout his career.", "text": "Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castell\u00f3n. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing \u2014 in particular his mastery of perspective \u2014 drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine F\u00edgaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Bolet\u00edn de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing \"increasing sophistication\" and being of \"complexity and extraordinary quality\". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of \u201cthe most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andaluc\u00eda for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career."}]}, "correct": false}

This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla\u00e7a del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts."}]}, "correct": false}

In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry.

In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Pla\u00e7a de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montju\u00efc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area."}, {"summary_score": 0.8474493393425885, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8459679137588259, "text_rank": 6, "summary": "During the 18th century, Barcelona experienced urban development with paved streets, installed sewers, and built drinking water fountains.

The neighborhood of La Barceloneta was constructed, and the Edicto de obreria was approved to control private works.

In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked primarily to the textile industry, which in turn led to a Catalan cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, under a project called the Eixample, drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 in 1859. After the revolution of 1868, the Citadel was also demolished and the land transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.Although chintz printing was well established in Barcelona since the 18th century, the industrial era proper began with the founding in 1832 of the Bonaplata Factory, founded by Josep Bonaplata. In 1849 the complex La Espa\u00f1a Industrial, owned by the Muntadas brothers, was opened in Sants. The textile industry grew steadily until a crisis in 1861, caused by the shortage of cotton due to the American Civil War. The metallurgical industry was also gaining importance, boosted by the creation of the railroad and steam navigation. In 1836 the Nueva Vulcano foundry opened in La Barceloneta and, in 1841, La Barcelonesa began, one of the predecessors of La Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima (1855), one of the most important factories in the history of Barcelona.Industrialization brought about important changes in the urban planning of the city, due to the new needs of the economic sectors of the capitalist system, which required a strong concentration of labor and auxiliary services. Barcelona thus underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and a better articulation of the territory through a wide network of roads and railroads, which will lead Barcelona to become a colonizing metropolis of its territorial environment.. During this century, the municipal ordinances that began with the Edicto de obrer\u00eda (Workmen's Edict) were consolidated: in 1814, the Preg\u00f3n de polic\u00eda urbana (Proclamation of Urban Police) established in 84 articles all the provisions on civil building, maintenance of public spaces and various regulations on security and public order. In 1839, the Bando general de buen gobierno (General Good Governance Charter) renewed and expanded these provisions and, among other things, regulated the relationship between the width of streets and the height of buildings. On the other hand, the law of January 8, 1845 established the City Council's own attributions in various aspects such as urban planning, regulating the sanitary conditions of public spaces, as well as the conditioning of streets, squares and markets. In 1856 the first Ordenanzas Municipales (Municipal Ordinances) were approved, which brought together and expanded previous provisions, within an urban code that contemplated for the first time all aspects of civic and institutional relations in the city. For the first time, building permits were required to include an interior layout plan. These ordinances soon became obsolete due to the new Eixample plan, until in 1891 new ones were drawn up that took into account the new specificities of the expansion and new links in the city. Among other things, the area of occupation of the plots was increased from 50% \u2014established in the Cerd\u00e0 Plan of 1859\u2014 to 70%.Among the main urban planning actions of these years were the opening of Calle de Fernando (Ferran) in 1827, between La Rambla and the Plaza de San Jaime (Sant Jaume), with a later continuation towards the Borne with the streets of Jaime I (Jaume I) (1849\u201353) and Princesa (1853). In 1833 the expansion of the Pla de Palau began, which was then the nerve center of the city, with the presence of the Royal Palace, the Llotja and the Aduana."}]}, "correct": true}

Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major.

The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km\u00b2. The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montju\u00efc; those of Martorell and Castellv\u00ed de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Erampruny\u00e0 (Gav\u00e0) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Bes\u00f2s river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10\u201312 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent \u2014later City Hall\u2014 or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital \u2014such as the Santa Creu\u2014 or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the B\u00f2ria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Pla\u00e7a Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara \u2014in the current Citadel Park\u2014, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marqu\u00e8s del l'Argentera.

It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc."}]}, "correct": false}

Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire.

From the end of the century it is worth mentioning Pere Garcia F\u00e0ria's project to regulate the city's sewage system (Proyecto de saneamiento del subsuelo de Barcelona: alcantarillado, drenaje, residuos urbanos, 1891). It was a project that placed special emphasis on hygienism, with innovative criteria that are still in force today: it established a visitable sewerage network, 80 cm wide by 170 cm high, maintained by a municipal brigade that still performs its functions. It is a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which works mainly by gravity \u2014except for a few small pumping stations\u2014 making it necessary to have large collectors in the lower part of the city. Thanks to this project, the sewerage network was extended in a few years from 31.2 km to 212 km. Around this time, the streets also began to be urbanized with tiled sidewalks and cobblestone roadways, replaced in the 1960s by asphalt.It should also be noted that during the nineteenth century the increase in population and new industrial needs led to an increase in water consumption, which required a larger water collection and distribution network. Thus, at the end of the century a new pipeline was built from Dosrius (Maresme), with a 17 km gallery and a 37 km aqueduct that brought water to the city. The first marketing companies appeared then, the main one of which was the Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona (AGBAR), created in 1882.On the other hand, the increase in population between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the creation of new hospitals to serve the population of the new districts of the city: the Hospital Cl\u00ednico y Provincial (1895-1906) and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (1902-1930), a monumental modernist-style complex designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. Later, the hospitals of Esperan\u00e7a (1924), the Red Cross (1924), the Military (1924) and the Hospital del Mar (1931) were created, while in 1955 the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, one of the main health referents of Catalonia, was inaugurated.During these years the Eixample was progressively urbanized, first thanks to private initiative and the so-called Sociedades de Fomento (Development societies), and from 1892 with the appearance of the Comisiones Especiales de Ensanche (Special Commissions for the Eixample) arising from the new Eixample Law of 1892. This law was based on the Law of Forced Expropriation of 1879, and developed a management system with public and private participation. The urbanization process used to have several phases: filling the area, parceling the land, installation of services such as sewerage, running water and lighting, and construction of buildings.

Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530 000 inhabitants, in 1930 they had almost doubled (1 009 000 hab), to reach between 1970 and 1980 the maximum peak (1 754 900) and by the end of the century to 1 500 000 inhabitants.With the turn of the century, a new political scenario opened up, marked by the loss of the colonies in America and Asia and the rise of the Regionalist League, led by politicians such as Francesc Camb\u00f3, Enric Prat de la Riba and the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who expressed their desire to place Barcelona on the international front line, at the level of cities such as Paris, New York, Berlin or Vienna.

Expansion of Barcelona (Eixample). In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir \u00a1Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerd\u00e0 Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliaci\u00f3n, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Bes\u00f2s, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Cerd\u00e0 had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral\u00b7lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Gl\u00f2ries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat. It also foresaw the opening of three large avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular one that would connect the Citadel with Montjuic (avenida de la Catedral). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would circumvent the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universitat and Sant Pere.. Cerd\u00e1's project was quite innovative for the time, especially with regard to the delimitation of green spaces and service areas, taking into account both functional, recreational and welfare aspects. The buildings were to have a height of 16 meters (first floor and four floors), and a depth of 10 to 20 meters. The distribution of the Eixample was to be in sectors of 20 x 20 blocks, divided into districts of 10 x 10 and neighborhoods of 5 x 5. Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park.

The Regional Plan of 1953 aimed to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities, meet housing demand, curb real estate speculation, and improve the urban environment, but encountered difficulties in its application.

This increase in buildability caused notable differences between buildings constructed at different times, and led to the presence of numerous party walls that disfigured the urban space, a problem that the city still suffers from despite several projects to remedy it, such as the Barcelona posa't guapa (Barcelona, make yourself pretty) campaign.The post-war urban renewal was led by the head of urban planning of the new authorities, Pedro Bidagor, who in 1945 promoted the creation of the Barcelona Provincial Planning Commission, responsible for drawing up a planning project for the city and its surroundings. Thus arose the Regional Plan of 1953, developed by Josep Soteras, an attempt to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities in order to meet the strong demand for housing in the years of massive immigration, while trying to curb real estate speculation and improve the urban environment. The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. It also reserved large areas for infrastructure, facilities and green spaces; among the latter, it emphasized the enclosure of the Collserola mountain range as a large central metropolitan park.Although it was not carried out in its entirety, various \"partial plans\" emerged from its initial approach, most of which yielded to the pressures of the land owners and tended towards the requalification of land: a 1971 study calculated a 1.8 multiplication of the population density of the partial plans with respect to the Comarcal of 1953. The most relevant were those referring to the two ends of the Diagonal avenue, east and west: in the first the new neighborhoods of La Verneda and Bes\u00f2s were created, while in the second the Zona Universitaria was projected and the neighborhoods of Les Corts and Collblanc were enlarged.. The growth of the population and the appearance of new neighborhoods implied the construction of new markets for the supply of basic products: Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (1944), Carme (1950), Sagrera (1950), Horta (1951), Vallvidrera (1953), Estrella (1954), Guinard\u00f3 (1954), Tres Torres (1958), Bon Pastor (1960), Montserrat (1960), Merc\u00e8 (1961), Corts (1961), Guineueta (1965), Ciutat Meridiana (1966), Felip II (1966), Sant Mart\u00ed (1966), Bes\u00f2s (1968), Sant Gervasi (1968), Carmel (1969), Vall d'Hebr\u00f3n (1969), Port (1973), Proven\u00e7als (1974), Lesseps (1974), Trinitat (1977) and Canyelles (1987).During these years, automobile traffic increased considerably, which led to the improvement of the city's road network: Meridiana Avenue was opened, the First Ring Road (Ronda del Mig) was built and the Second Ring Road was planned, the construction of subway parking lots was started and the freeway network was extended thanks to the 1962 arterial network project, with a set of radial highways starting from Barcelona in several axes (Vall\u00e8s, Llobregat, Maresme)."}]}, "correct": true}

Its geographical location is between 41\u00b016' and 41\u00b030' north latitude and between 1\u00b054' and 2\u00b018' east longitude. With an area of 102.16 km\u00b2, it is situated on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Collserola mountain range \u2014with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point\u2014, as well as by the deltas of the Bes\u00f3s and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the mountain of Montju\u00efc (184.8 m). Also, from the Collserola mountain range, several hills that follow a line parallel to the coastal range rise up on the plain: the hills of La Peira (133 m), La Rovira (261 m), El Carmel (267 m), Creueta del Coll (249 m), El Putget (181 m) and Monterols (121 m).The plain of Barcelona is not uniform, but has several undulations caused by the many torrents that once crossed the land, and also has a uniform slope from the sea to the Collserola mountain range, with an ascent of about 260 m. It is crossed by several faults, mainly the one that separates the Collserola mountain range from the hills that come forward in the plain, with a northeast-southwest orientation, and the one that separates the mountain of Montjuic from the coast. The terrain is formed by a substrate of slate and granitic formations, as well as clays and limestones. The coast was formerly occupied by tidal marshes and salt-water lagoons, which disappeared as the coastline advanced thanks to the sediments provided by the rivers and streams that flowed into the beach; it is estimated that since the sixth century BC, the coastline has been able to advance about 5 km. The area of the plain was formerly crossed by numerous torrents and streams, which were grouped into three fluvial sectors: Horta stream in the area near the Bes\u00f2s river (or eastern area); the Blanca stream and the Gornal torrent in the Llobregat area (or western area); and, in the central area of the plain, a group of streams coming from the southern slope of Tibidabo, such as the San Gervasi, Vallcarca, Mag\u00f2ria and Collserola streams.The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters thanks to the protection that the orography of the terrain offers to the plain, which is sheltered from the north winds. The temperature usually ranges between 9.5 \u00b0C and 24.3 \u00b0C, on average. Rainfall is low, about 600 mm per year, and most of the precipitation occurs in spring and autumn. This scarcity meant that in the past numerous works had to be carried out to supply water to the city, including wells, canals and irrigation ditches. The vegetation of the area consists mainly of pines and evergreen oaks, and undergrowth of heather, laurestine, arbutus and climbing plants.

The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little..

Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire.

A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea."}]}, "correct": true}

In 1928 the green light was incorporated as a \"free\" signal, and in 1931 the color black and yellow was established as the city's distinguishing color.. In the 1920s, urban transport was improved with the construction of the Barcelona Metro. Work began in 1920 with the installation of two lines: line 3 (Lesseps-Liceo), inaugurated in 1924, and line 1 (Catalu\u00f1a-Bordeta), put into service in 1926. The network was progressively expanded, and today Barcelona has 12 lines. Initially it was operated by three companies: Gran Metropolitano de Barcelona (L3), Metropolitano Transversal (L1) and Ferrocarril de Sarri\u00e0 a Barcelona (now Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya); the first two merged in 1957 into the company Ferrocarril Metropolitano de Barcelona, which together with the bus company Transportes de Barcelona formed in 1979 the company Transportes Metropolitanos de Barcelona (TMB).It should also be noted that during the first decades of the century, public schooling was greatly boosted, thanks above all to the initiative of the City Council, the Provincial Deputation and the Commonwealth of Catalonia. In 1922, the City Council created the Patronat Escolar, which promoted secular, bilingual education and pedagogical renovation, and promoted an ambitious plan of school buildings, including those built in noucentista style by Josep Goday (Ramon Llull, Collaso i Gil, Llu\u00eds Vives, Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals, Baixeras and Pere Vila schools). After the Civil War, public education was taken over by the central government, until the arrival of democracy, when the competences were transferred to the Generalitat.In these years, increasing importance was also given to the question of green spaces, which was raised in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubi\u00f3 i Tudur\u00ed, director of the Parks and Gardens Service of Barcelona: with the text El problema de los espacios libres (The problem of open spaces), presented at the XI Congreso Nacional de Arquitectos (XI National Congress of Architects), he proposed the placement of a series of green spaces in the form of concentric semicircles between the Bes\u00f2s and Llobregat rivers, all along the Collserola mountain range, with small enclaves in the inner part of the city in the style of the London squares. He proposed four levels for the city: interior parks, among which would be the Citadel and Montju\u00efc, as well as three smaller ones (Letamendi, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and Gl\u00f2ries); suburban parks, among which would be the Hippodrome, Tur\u00f3 Park, Tur\u00f3 Gil, Font del Rac\u00f3, Vallcarca, Guinard\u00f3 and Park G\u00fcell; exterior parks (Llobregat, Pedralbes, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo, Sant Medir, Horta and Bes\u00f2s); and the Collserola nature reserve.

In 1929 the International Exposition was held in Montju\u00efc.

Garriga's project foresaw the realignment of streets as the basic method of a broad renovation of the city's interior, but the difficulty of its execution and the absence of expropriation mechanisms paralyzed this first project.. A more elaborate project was carried out by \u00c0ngel Baixeras in 1878, who presented an expropriation bill to the Senate, which was approved in 1879. Baixeras' project envisaged a thorough remodeling of the old city, and its most outstanding aspect was the opening of three major thoroughfares \u2014initially called A, B and C\u2014 to make the old city center more walkable, following Cerd\u00e0's old project. However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed V\u00eda Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport. In 1860 an omnibus line had been opened along La Rambla, but the slowness of the carriages made this means of transport not very viable. In 1872, rails were laid for its traction, which lightened the transport, with imperial model cars \u2014of English origin\u2014, pulled by two or four horses. The line was extended from the port (Drassanes) to the village of Gracia, and later from the Drassanes to La Barceloneta. One of the first lines to operate was the English Barcelona Tramways Company Limited. In 1899 the streetcars were electrified.. During these years, street furniture also grew, especially since the appointment in 1871 of Antoni Rovira i Trias as head of Buildings and Ornamentation of the City Council, as well as his successor, Pere Falqu\u00e9s, who made a special effort to combine aesthetics and functionality for this type of urban adornments. The increase of elements such as lampposts, fountains, benches, kiosks, railings, planters, mailboxes and other public services was favored by the rise of the iron industry, which allowed their mass production and resulted in greater strength and durability.. In the 1880s the installation of electric lighting began, which gradually replaced the gas lighting on public roads. In 1882 the first street lamps were placed in the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, and between 1887 and 1888 La Rambla and Passeig de Colom were electrified. However, the generalization of electric light did not take place until the beginning of the 20th century, with the invention of the light bulb, and it was not completed until 1929.Another service that emerged at the end of the century was the telephone. The first telephone communication in the whole peninsula took place in Barcelona, in 1877, between the Montjuic castle and the fortress of the Citadel \u2014in the process of dismantling but still housing a garrison\u2014. That same year the first interurban transmission between Barcelona and Girona was carried out by the company Dalmau i Fills, pioneer in the installation of lines in Barcelona. In 1884 the state monopoly of the service was established, but two years later the company Sociedad General de Tel\u00e9fonos de Barcelona (General Telephone Society of Barcelona) was authorized to operate it, which was later absorbed by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Peninsular de Tel\u00e9fonos (Peninsular Telephone Company). In 1925 the service was nationalized by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Telef\u00f3nica Nacional de Espa\u00f1a (National Telephone Company of Spain) was created. In 1897 there were 2479 telephones in the city, a figure that grew progressively: in 1917 there were about 10 .00, in 1930 26 .00, in 1960 200 .00, in 1985 750 .00 and in 2000 there were 850 .00 telephones.It should also be noted that in the last third of the century numerous supply markets were built, many of them made of iron, a fashionable element in the architecture of the time."}]}, "correct": true}

The issue of pension reforms has been dealt with by various French governments over recent decades, specifically to tackle budget shortfalls. France has one of the lowest retirement ages for an industrialised country, and spends more than most countries on pensions, with it amounting to almost 14% of economic output. France's pension system is largely built on a \"pay-as-you-go structure\"; both workers and employers \"are assessed mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund retiree pensions\". This system, \"which has enabled generations to retire with a guaranteed, state-backed pension, will not change\". Compared to other European countries, France possesses \"one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty\", with a net pension replacement rate (\"a measure of how effectively retirement income replaces prior earnings\") of 74%, higher than OECD and EU averages.. The New York Times says the government argues rising life expectancy  \"have left the system in an increasingly precarious state\"; \"[i]n 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections\". In addition, the cost of pensions has partially contributed to France's national debt rising to 112% of GDP, compared to 98% before the COVID-19 pandemic; this is one of the highest levels in the EU, higher than the UK and Germany. In an interview in March 2023, Macron said that \"when he began working there were 10 million French pensioners and now there were 17 million\". The New York Times add that in order \"[t]o keep the system financially viable without funneling more taxpayer money into it \u2013 something the government already does \u2013 Macron sought to gradually raise the legal age when workers can start collecting a pension by three months every year until it reaches 64 in 2030.\" Additionally, Macron has \"accelerated a previous change that increased the number of years that workers must pay into the system to get a full pension and abolished special pension \u200crules that benefited workers in sectors like energy and transportation\".As part of Macron's pension reforms, the retirement age was to be raised to 64 or 65, from 62.  The pay-as-you-go system \u2013  raising the retirement age would help to further finance, as life expectancy increases and more start work later \u2013 would have a surplus of \u20ac3.2bn in 2022, but the government's pensions advisory board (COR) forecast that it would \"fall into structural deficits in coming decades unless new financing sources are found\". In March 2023, Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt said that \"without immediate action\" the pensions deficit would exceed $13bn annually by 2027. The government stated that the reforms would \"balance the deficit\" in 2030, with a surplus amounting to billions of dollars that would \"pay for measures allowing those in physically demanding jobs to retire early\".The pension reforms have long been under consideration by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\".On 26 October 2022, Macron announced that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, be gradually increased from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 \u2013 the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from.In his New Year's Eve speech on 31 December 2022, he clarified that the reforms would be implemented by autumn 2023. In early January 2023 prior to consultation with unions, Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne spoke on FranceInfo radio, stating that the government could \"show flexibility\" on the intention to raise the retirement age to 65, and were willing to explore \"other solutions\" that would enable the government to \"reach its target of balancing the pensions system by 2030\".

Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be \"a bit penalised by the reform\" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in 'physically or mentally demanding' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to \"mollify opposition\", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter\" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law. At the other end of the scale, it has been reported that some are concerned about \"being forced to retire later because older adults who want to work but who lose their jobs often face age discrimination in the labor market\".. Those opposed to the reforms argue \"the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers\", and have \"disputed the need for urgency\", The New York Times saying they contest that \"Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy\". In addition, opponents opine that Macron has \"exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies\", and that \"the official body that monitors France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits\", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, \"were hard to accurately predict\".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France's political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him, having \"struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'\".

These reforms, aimed at balancing the pension system by 2030, initially proposed raising the retirement age to 65.

The policy was anticipated to be presented in January and debated in parliament in early February, with the potential use of Article 49.3 to pass the bill without a vote.\n\nThe reforms have been criticized for their disproportionate impact on women and the working class.

Women are already subject to later retirement due to taking time away from work to raise children. Euronews outlined that the reforms would lead to women retiring later and working, on average, seven months longer over the course of their life, while men would work around five months longer. They quoted Franck Riester, the Minister Delegate for Parliamentary Relations, admitting that women would be \"a bit penalised by the reform\" in January.As well as this, it has been argued the reforms will hit the working-class and those who work in manual jobs disproportionately. CNN pointed out that blue-collar workers are likely to start working at a younger age than white-collar workers; The Washington Post pointed out that a minor part of those employed in 'physically or mentally demanding' jobs are still eligible to retire earlier with a full pension, which Macron previously removed most exceptions for allowing them to depart early in case of work induced disabilties although The New York Times equally pointed to how this was a concession by the government to \"mollify opposition\", which overall has failed because unions view the increase in the retirement age as a \"non-starter\" and was later removed as result of passing the age rise as a financial law. At the other end of the scale, it has been reported that some are concerned about \"being forced to retire later because older adults who want to work but who lose their jobs often face age discrimination in the labor market\".. Those opposed to the reforms argue \"the government is prioritizing businesses and people who are highly paid over average laborers\", and have \"disputed the need for urgency\", The New York Times saying they contest that \"Macron is attacking a cherished right to retirement and unfairly burdening blue-collar workers because of his refusal to increase taxes on the wealthy\". In addition, opponents opine that Macron has \"exaggerated the threat of projected deficits and refused to consider other ways to balance the system, like increasing worker payroll taxes, decoupling pensions from inflation or increasing taxes on wealthy households or companies\", and that \"the official body that monitors France's pension system has acknowledged that there is no immediate threat of bankruptcy and that long-term deficits\", which Macron and the government have argued would occur if these reforms were not implemented, \"were hard to accurately predict\".Jean Garrigues, a historian on France's political culture, theorized the unpopularity of the reforms can be partially attributed to Macron personally, given the \"pre-existing anger against\" him, having \"struggled to shake off the image of an out-of-touch 'president of the rich'\".

The protestors' march ended at the Place d'Italie. Known as \"Greve 15 mars\", it was co-ordinated and organised by eight trade unions.. Liquefied natural gas operations were suspended, with public transport severely affected; it was stated that 40% of high-speed trains and half the regional trains were cancelled, with the Paris M\u00e9tro running slower.

General impact and analysis. Concerns over increasing violence. Multiple outlets, including media and unions, have grown concern over the increasing use of violence in the protests, particularly in the days since the government invoked Article 49.3, with comparisons made to the Gilets jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests of the first years of Macron's presidency. On 19 March, The Guardian commented that as \"police brace[d] for a week of unpredictable, spontaneous protests in cities and small towns across France, the mood of anger was likened to the start of the gilets jaunes protests\". On 20 March, Reuters also voiced that the tone of the protests had deteriorated to, and were \"reminiscent\" to, that of the Yellow Vest protest in recent days. Euronews, on 21 March, claimed that \"government insiders and observers have raised fears that France is again heading for another bout of violent anti-government protests\". On 22 March, Reuters outlined that \"[p]rotests against the bill have drawn huge crowds in rallies organised by unions since January\", of which \"[m]ost have been peaceful, but anger has mounted since the government pushed the bill through parliament without a vote last week\"; \"[t]he past six nights have seen fierce demonstrations across France with bins set ablaze and scuffles with police\".France 24 commented that unions had been \"united in coordinating their protests\", but that \"many expressed fears they could lose control of the protests as more radical demonstrators set the tone\". Fabrice Coudour, a leading representative for the 'hard-left' CGT, commented that \"tougher action ahead, more serious and further-reaching\" was possible that could \"escape our collective decision-making\". Jean-Marie Pernot, a political scientist specialising in trade unions, said that a lack of \"respect [for] any of the channels meant for the expression of dissent, it will find a way to express itself directly\". One of the Yellow Vests' \"prominent spokesmen\", Jerome Rodrigues, spoke to protesters outside the National Assembly after the invoking of Article 49.3 on 17 March, that \"the objective was now nothing less than \"the defeat\" of the president.\"Head of the UNSA trade union federation, Lauren Escure, admitted that \"when there is this much anger and so many French people on the streets, the more radical elements take the floor\", and that it was not something they would want, but was inevitable, and \"will be entirely the government's fault,\" he told AFP. The heads of two 'moderate' unions, Cyril Chabanier of CFTC and Laurent Berger of CFDT, expressed that unions were concerned. Cabanier said that an impression that \"it is just violence that pays\" was being created, and that \"[t]here are some people who are very angry, [and] the anger leads to greater radicalisation and radicalisation unfortunately leads to violence\".

This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used \"criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom,\" said Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods\". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a \"judicialisation of policing\" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of \"participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage\"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the \"violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests\" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Cl\u00e9ment Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that \"there are no unjustified arrests\", and people are questioned for \"offences which, in our eyes, are constituted\" and \"48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short\". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding \"when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others\"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the \"manoeuvre is risky\", as they \"expose the workforce, monopolise officers\" and \"risk radicalising the demonstrators\".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the \"police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week\". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were \"on pretty brutal form\" \u2013 stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press \u2013 and were also throwing their stun grenades with \"abandon\".

Hypothetical alternatives. Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support \u2013 unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) \u2013 and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'initiative partag\u00e9e (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done \"before the enactment of the law\"; yet, according to St\u00e9phane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated \"the retirement age cannot exceed 62\". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, \"thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work.\"Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, \"several appeals\" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would \"argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances\", and that \"[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'\u00c9tat (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional\".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms.

Many theorised that in the aftermath of the pension reforms controversy, Macron would fire Prime Minister Borne, such as \"to try and reset his image\", while prominent figures of opposition parties suggested using a referendum, and put the decision to implement the reforms to voters.Prior to the no-confidence votes (which failed and thus the pension reforms entered into law), France 24 outlined the alternatives. They contended that the votes were likely to fail, even the one tabled by the centrist group LIOT which was most likely to attract transpartisan support \u2013 unless enough members of the Republicans broke ranks and voted in favour (which did not happen) \u2013 and the potential consequence of the National Assembly being dissolved and fresh elections being triggered (which Macron has at his disposal regardless) was also unlikely. Failure of the no-confidence votes leaves attempts to hold a referendum as one other option, known as a r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'initiative partag\u00e9e (a shared-initiative referendum, or RIP); it requires the support of one-fifth of both the National Assembly and Senate, as well as the signatures of a tenth of the electorate, which need to be collected within nine months. However, it was pointed out that the triggering of an 'RIP' would need to have been done \"before the enactment of the law\"; yet, according to St\u00e9phane Peu, deputy of the Communist Party Deputy, NUPES has had the support of the necessary 185 National Assembly members since 14 March, two days before the invoking of Article 49.3; he said his bill would include language that stated \"the retirement age cannot exceed 62\". The Times, on 19 March, wrote that the process being started would lead to the pension reforms being unable to be introduced until the referendum took place, \"thwarting Macron's plans to start bringing in the changes from September and casting a shadow over the government's other work.\"Furthermore, it was announced that members of NUPES would appeal to the Constitutional Council; a deputy of the LIOT group said on 14 March that had the bill passed by vote in the National Assembly, \"several appeals\" would have been made. France 24 said that NUPES would \"argue that the reform, which was inserted into the social security budget, is a legislative rider, since the text addresses more than just finances\", and that \"[l]eft-wing deputies intend to rely on the opinion of France's Conseil d'\u00c9tat (Council of State), which had warned the government of a risk that certain measures in its pension reform plan, as well as the plan's lack of clear calculations, were unconstitutional\".On 21 March, Macron declared he would not dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum on the reforms. Postponement of Charles III's state visit. On 3 March, it was announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla, would visit France between 26 and 29 March. However, in the week leading up to the scheduled visit, many news organizations began to report that the King's visit could be disrupted by the ongoing protests.The optics for the trip were criticised."}]}, "correct": true}

Euronews reported that, of the 292 arrested after the protests on 16 March only nine were \"charged with actual offences\". Additionally, they have reported that many who just happened to be passing by were taken into custody, some without a \"clear reason why\", with French media reporting two Austrian children on a school trip were taken into custody after the 16 March protests, only released following intervention by the Austrian Embassy.. On 17 March, 60 people were taken into custody, with 34 cases closed, 21 with another result (such as a caution or warning), with just five ending up at trial. Coline Bouillon, a lawyer who represented some demonstrators, told Euronews that a large group of people who had been at a conference were \"rounded up\", police justifying the arrests for their \"participation in a group with a view to preparing violence\", or \"concealing their faces\"; they were remanded in custody for one to two days; she, among a group of lawyers, intend to \"file a collective complaint against the police for \"arbitrary detention\" and \"obstruction of the freedom to demonstrate\".\"Such \"arbitrary police custody\", \"mass-arrest\", tactics have been accused \u2013 by politicians, judges and lawyers alike \u2013 of being utilised \"simply to frustrate the protest movement\", it being perceived, through precedent (such as in the gilet jaunes protests), as a \"repression of the social movement\". This view was shared by a judges' union, the Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), with Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer in judiciary repression methods, commenting that it was the first time the government had used \"criminal law to dissuade demonstrators from demonstrating and exercising their freedom,\" said Rapha\u00ebl Kempf, a French lawyer specialising in judiciary repression methods\". Fabien Jobard, research director at France's National Scientific Research Centre CNRS, said that a \"judicialisation of policing\" has taken place over the past 15 years, with specific reference to a 2010 law that created the offence of \"participation in a group with a view to committing violence or damage\"; its original remit of mitigating against 'gang violence' and at sporting venues has been expanded to protests and demonstrations.According to Le Monde critics are expressing concerns over the \"violent confrontations and the systematic use of arrests\" at rallies.On 20 March,  on television, police were seen momentarily firing tear gas and rushing at demonstrators in several cities, with special motorbike officers thrusting through protesters, which made Cl\u00e9ment Voule, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association, respond on Twitter by stating that officers should avoid using disproportionate force.On 21 March, an Interior Ministry spokesperson commented that \"there are no unjustified arrests\", and people are questioned for \"offences which, in our eyes, are constituted\" and \"48 hours (of police custody) to try to process the offence is short\". AFP was told by a senior police source that instructions have not been given to conduct mass arrests, adding \"when high-risk profiles are arrested, they are no longer agitating others\"; another officer added that with such a high number of arrests, the \"manoeuvre is risky\", as they \"expose the workforce, monopolise officers\" and \"risk radicalising the demonstrators\".On 21 March, The Guardian reported that the \"police watchdog is investigating allegations that four young women in Nantes were sexually assaulted during police controls at a demonstration last week\". On 23 March, British journalist Lewis Goodall, covering the demonstrations in Paris, reported that police were \"on pretty brutal form\" \u2013 stating a member of his team had been targeted by police despite asserting they were press \u2013 and were also throwing their stun grenades with \"abandon\". During the protests of the 23 March, hundreds of officers were injured across France. However, as BBC News wrote, protesters were also injured by police stun grenades, and the Council of Europe declared that there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities. Political ramifications. Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 has been compared to former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2010 reform that raised the retirement age from 60 to 62, which also led to massive strikes and protests across France. Public opinion polling analysis has shown that Sarkozy's push for reform played a role in driving voters to both the Socialist Party and the far-right National Front in the 2012 presidential election.One author of a paper in academic journal West European Politics tweeted a screenshot of the results of a study that showed executive approval has historically fallen after no-confidence votes, and linked it to what the impact of invoking Article 49.3 could be."}]}, "correct": false}

In Ad\u0131yaman, two drowning deaths occurred when floodwaters swept away a container home with a family. Over a dozen professional divers participated in search and rescue efforts in each province. 2023 elections. Before the earthquake, the government had planned the elections to be held on 14 May 2023, a month earlier than its latest possible date as a snap election. After the earthquake, doubts arose if elections could be held on schedule. On 13 February, B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7 of the AKP demanded the elections be postponed despite the constitution disallowing such a possibility in the absence of war. Ar\u0131n\u00e7's declaration has been criticized by media outlets and politicians. It remains to be seen whether the governing coalition, with its 333 seats in parliament, can surpass the 400-number hurdle needed to pass such proposals by changing the constitution. On 18 February, AKP authorities stated that the elections would not be delayed.Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu of the CHP opposed its postponement on constitutional grounds. Mustafa Tolga \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, YSK member of the \u0130Y\u0130 party stated that YSK does not have any power to postpone an election and only parliament has the right to do so, adding that Turkey had no more time to lose with the AKP. Selahattin Demirta\u015f of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) has described the postponement as a political coup. The declaration of state of emergency in the affected regions was also interpreted as a possible measure to postpone elections. Nevertheless, the earthquake led to the main anti-Erdo\u011fan coalition postponing its 13 February meeting for the selection of its consensus presidential candidate to 6 March.At the elections, the Erdo\u011fan-lead elecotral People's Alliance retained its majority in the Grand National Assembly, while Erdo\u011fan in the first round of the presidential election received 49.5% with 52.2% in the second one against K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. This marked the first time a Turkish presidential election went into a run-off. Education. On 9 February, the Council of Higher Education said education and training at universities in the affected provinces would be suspended until further notice. Student hostels managed by the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels would be used to house affected individuals. The minister of national education, Mahmut \u00d6zer, ordered a week-long closure of all schools in the country, which was later extended to two weeks. Schools in the affected provinces were suspended until 10 March. Students studying in schools located in the affected provinces would be transferred to other provinces of their choice. Sports. After the earthquake, S\u00fcper Lig was suspended for over a week to mourn the victims."}]}, "correct": false}

The rupture lasted about 35 seconds.The Mw\u202f 6.4 aftershock on 20 February occurred along the Hatay Fault. The focal mechanism indicated normal faulting along a northeast-southwest striking fault. Surface rupture. The extent of surface ruptures associated with the M7.8 and M7.7 earthquakes have been mapped using a mixture of satellite imagery and ground observations. Pixel matching on images captured by Sentinel-1 before and after the earthquakes showed sharp discontinuities in displacement, revealing two separate zones of surface rupture. The longer of the pair, produced by the first earthquake, measured 320 km (200 mi) while the second earthquake produced 150 km (93 mi) of surface rupture. These observations were backed up with direct imaging of the ruptures using other satellite data, such as from the DigitalGlobe's WorldView-1, 2 & 3 and GeoEye-1, and by field work. Remote sensing using satellite imagery indicated 30 km (19 mi) of surface rupture with large normal faulting component.. The zone of surface rupture extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarc\u0131k, Kahramanmara\u015f Province and G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province. Surface ruptures continued north of these cities. Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley. The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation. A major canal was damaged and lead to flooding in parts of the Amik Valley which was formerly Lake Amik. Field observations indicate a maximum displacement of 7.3 m (24 ft) on the surface. Geologists traced a 15 km (9.3 mi) surface rupture trending south from Pazarc\u0131k with an offset of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). From Golbasi to Nurda\u011f\u0131 ground displacements were up to 5 m (16 ft). The surface rupture observed during the M7.8 earthquake was unusually large, comparable to that during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake along the San Andreas Fault.Large surface offsets of 6\u20138 m (20\u201326 ft) were observed along the S\u00fcrg\u00fc-\u00c7ardak Fault. The largest offset was measured along a road west of G\u00f6zp\u0131nar; the rupture displaced the road left-laterally for 8.6 m (28 ft). Ground motion. Ground acceleration values recorded in some areas near the fault rupture were in excess of 1 g. Three USGS seismic installations, two at Antakya and one at Hassa, recorded large ground accelerations and velocities. The town of Hassa recorded 0.9082 g in ground acceleration (pga) and 215.34 cm/s (84.78 in/s) in ground velocity. The station data corresponded to a Modified Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). A peak ground acceleration of 1.62 g was recorded by a station at Fevzipa\u015fa. The peak ground acceleration generally exceeded 0.5 g in a large area around the epicenter, near Adiyaman and a large part of Hatay. High pga values of 2 g were recorded in Hatay. The maximum recorded pga was 2.212 g at a station in Pazarc\u0131k Belediyesi Park\u0131, Pazarc\u0131k; a government health facility nearby had sparce damage but the surrounding town was devastated. The maximum recorded pga during the Mw\u202f 7.7 earthquake was 0.59 g at G\u00f6ksun.According to Kandilli Observatory, the maximum Mercalli intensity (MMI) of the mainshock was estimated to have reached MMI XI\u2013XII (Extreme) in Antakya and near the epicenter. MMI XI (Extreme) or higher was observed along the fault rupture from the epicenter to Antakya.

Liquefaction was identified via satellite and remote sensing along the southern portion of the Mw\u202f7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments. These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.  Liquefaction was also observed in Samanda\u011f. At Lake G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Ad\u0131yaman Province, lateral spreading occurred along the northern, eastern and southern coast. Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged. G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.. Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in \u0130skenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atat\u00fcrk Boulevard in \u00c7ay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure. The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200 m (660 ft). Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at \u0130skenderun.Despite an epicenter 90 km (56 mi) inland, a tsunami was recorded in the Mediterranean Sea. Small tsunami waves were recorded off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, without damage. The tsunami measured 0.17 m (6.7 in), and tsunami waves were recorded at 0.12 m (4.7 in) at \u0130skenderun and 0.13 m (5.1 in) at Erdemli.

There were 50,783 deaths, 297 missing and 107,204 injured across 11 of the 17 affected provinces of Turkey. At least 15.73 million people and 4 million buildings were affected. About 345,000 apartments were destroyed. More than 2 million residents in the affected provinces were evacuated to nearby provinces including Mersin, Antalya, Mardin, Ni\u011fde and Konya. More than 20 percent of Turkey's agriculture production was affected. The United Nations said crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and rural infrastructure were heavily damaged. At least 516 university buildings were affected, of which 106 were heavily damaged.By 23 February 2023, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change conducted damage inspections for 1.25 million buildings; revealing 164,000 buildings were either destroyed or severely damaged. A further 150,000 commercial infrastructure were at least moderately damaged. The International Organization for Migration estimated over 2.7 million people were made homeless. A damage assessment by the Turkish government revealed at least 61,722 buildings had to be demolished including 11,900 in Gaziantep Province, 10,900 in Hatay Province, 10,800 in Kahramanmara\u015f Province and 28,914 in Malatya Province. Broad fissures appeared on roads. During recovery efforts, body parts were often found in the rubble.. In Adana, 12 buildings collapsed in the city center, 23 were badly damaged and 120 were moderately damaged. Three apartments were among the buildings that collapsed in the city. Across Adana Province, damage assessments revealed 59 buildings and 1,274 apartments were destroyed or required demolition.At least 300 buildings were razed in Malatya. Sixty percent of the city's buildings received damage. Nearly every neighborhood of the city was affected by collapsed buildings.

In addition to the fines, both Halk TV and TELE1 were required to suspend airing of the shows that had criticized the government for five days. The CPJ's statement said that Turkey officials should revoke both the fine and penalties along with refraining from silencing the media for its earthquake coverage. Criminal investigation in Turkey. On 7 February, Turkish police said they detained four people over \"provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic\" on social media following the earthquake. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged that Turkish security forces tortured and ill-treated individuals arrested on suspicion of looting. In a report from both organizations, one person died while being held by authorities. The report said allegations of torture came from 10 provinces, but most reports were in Antakya, Hatay Province.On 9 February, minister of justice, Bekir Bozda\u011f, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Bozda\u011f said: \"Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary\". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, the justice ministry announced the plan to establish the \"Earthquake Crimes Investigation\" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trial. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for \"spreading misinformation\" or for \"\"provoking the people into animosity and hatred\" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozda\u011f said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey.

He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an \"earthquake tax\" (officially \"special communications tax\") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; \u00a33.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP. Disaster management. AFAD, the state organ for the disaster relief, was criticized on the grounds of slowness during the first days of the earthquake. There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added that the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. \u0130smail Palako\u011flu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD and a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages. On 16 February the district governor of Pazarcik accompanied by the gendarmerie seized aid stored in a distribution center established jointly by the HDP and the Hasankoca Neighborhood Assistance and Solidarity Association in presence of the head of the Diyarbak\u0131r Chamber of Industry arguing they could not distribute aid independently.On 9 February 2023, the governing alliance between the MHP and the AKP approved a state of emergency in 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes.

The US State Department said it would use its humanitarian partners on the ground.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey. Border crossings into Turkey remained closed on 7 February. Critically injured patients were unable to enter Turkey for medical attention. There were exceptions as to which persons could cross, including individuals holding touristic residence permits who could only cross by foot. The Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing was made accessible on 8 February, according to the UN.Some hotels including in Latakia and Damascus offered to accommodate to survivors free of charge and ensure basic necessities. Refugees and expatriates also opened their homes as shelters for people. Al-Sham Private University started an effort to receive people. Sports facilities, events venues, university dormitories and halls were also opened to take in people. The Syria Trust for Development announced the establishment of shelters across many governorates. Volunteer groups inspected buildings for damage and distributed food items, blankets, and first aid essentials.. Due to the high number of casualties, including trauma cases, many hospitals became overcrowded. Hospitals were already experiencing a shortage of medical supplies prior to the earthquake. Hospitals in many cities were forced to operate far beyond capacity. Many patients at hospitals slept on floors due to the lack of beds. The Ministry of Health dispatched medical convoys from the Health Directorates of Damascus, Rif Dimashq Governorate, Quneitra, Homs, and Tartus, to Aleppo and Latakia to rebel-held areas. Twenty-eight ambulances, seven mobile clinics, and four trucks carrying medical, surgical and emergency aid were also dispatched.

With a lack of equipment and tools, they appealed to other humanitarian organizations for support. Officials on 7 February announced rescue and recovery efforts in Hama ended after 15 hours. Over 298,000 people were left without homes and 180 shelters were opened in government-held areas. About 30,000 people were housed in shelters in Aleppo. As of 10 February, no international rescue workers had arrived in rebel-held Jinderis despite official calls for help.United States sanctions against Syria relating to the blocking of banks and payment processors led to the banning of international charities and families attempting to send money to people affected in Syria. On 7 February 2023, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent urged Western countries to lift sanctions against Syria, saying the measures hurt civilians and humanitarian efforts during the earthquake recovery effort. The sanctions are a series of economic measures taken by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and the Arab League against the Assad regime from the start of the civil war in 2011. They include an oil embargo and the freezing of financial assets of the state and government officials. There were requests to lift or suspend the sanctions to aid humanitarian efforts following the earthquake.On 10 February, the United States announced it would exempt sanctions against Syria for 180 days. The ease of sanctions was for \"all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts\", according to the United States Department of the Treasury. The Syrian Ministry responded in a statement that the US' decision was \"misleading and aims to give a false humanitarian impression\" and that \"the facts on the ground proved its falsehood.\" Some commentators have argued that the sanctions do not pose a problem for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria.. International humanitarian assistance began entering northwestern Syria on 9 February via Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. The first convoy of six trucks carried tents and sanitary items. Turkey said it was working to open two additional border crossings.

After their round 2 loss to Devonport List was selected in the 23 man training squad for Auckland's match with Northland. He then played for Kingsland against Newton on May 10 in a 14\u20138 loss. The Sun said that he \u201cwas on form, and his deadly fend proved a regular nightmare to some members of the opposition, but he failed to run straight, and gave his wingers insufficient room in which to work\u201d.. List was then named on the wing for Auckland for their May 17 match with Northland. Auckland won the match 21-16 before a crowd of 8,000 at Carlaw Park. List had a rare poor game and \u201ca weak attempt at tackling by him let Whitelaw, the visitor\u2019s right winger, run rings around him\u201d, resulting in a try to Dunn. The Auckland Star said \u201cList by no means justified his selection\u201d, he \u201cwas uncertain in his movements, dropped passes all to frequently, and did not prove a match for his vis-a-vis, Whitelaw\u201d. The Sun said \u201cneither List nor R. Carter was very impressive. List seemed to be right off his game. He has been so long at centre that he appeared to be at a loss to know what to do on the wing\u201d.He was \"again disappointing\" in Kingsland's next match with Richmond on May 24. He \u201cmishandled at times, but was given few real chances\u201d. The New Zealand side was touring Australia later in the season so his poor form was relevant for further rep honours in 1930. He was then omitted from the Auckland side to play South Auckland on May 31 after having been named in a 20-man squad to train prior.List spent the remainder of the season in the maroon jersey of Kingsland. The following week he scored a try in a 31\u201310 loss to Ellerslie where he played well but had few opportunities. His play then turned around in a narrow 17\u201313 loss to City. He \u201cstruck his best form and was a tower of strength to his side. It was about his best exhibition this season\u201d. Both he and Carter were \u201coutstanding and were responsible to no mean extent for the showing made by their side\u201d. List played in matches against Ponsonby, Marist and then Devonport. Against Devonport he scored a try in a 13\u20136 loss on July 12 at the Devonport Domain. For Kingsland he was \u201ceasily the best back. His fine defensive work prevented a heavier defeat. Simms ably led the forwards\u201d. He \u201cat centre, was brilliant in patches\u201d. List then scored two tries in Kingsland's 13\u20135 win over Newton. He \u201cgave a glimpse of the form which gained him a place in the Auckland team three seasons ago\u201d. The Sun said he \u201cplayed a strenuous and consistent all-round game on Saturday\u201d.

He scored another try in a 13\u20138 loss to City though \u201clacked opportunities\u201d but still played a great defensive game towards the end. The Herald criticised his play saying \u201cList at centre three-quarter, is certainly a powerful runner, but it is surprising to see a player of his experience hold on to the ball after an opportunity is presented to the wing.

He scored after he \u201chad taken the ball at his feet, from halfway, and just beat Grace in a spectacular dive\u201d. He \u201cplayed a sound game.

In 1931 Kingsland was forced to merge with Marist Old Boys.

List then traveled with 10 other Aucklanders down to Christchurch to join the rest of the New Zealand squad for the second test. Changes were made to the New Zealand back line with Puti Tipene Watene named at fullback, List moved to the wing, Brisbane and Cooke in the centre positions, Ben Davidson on the other win, Wilf Hassan at five eighth, and Edwin Abbott at halfback. List was playing opposite English winger Stanley Smith once more. New Zealand lost 25 to 14 before 5,000 spectators. List scored both of New Zealand's tries. Early in the match \u201cCooke, following up a New Zealand kick very fast, caught Sullivan with the ball. From the ensuing play, the ball was whipped out to Brisbane, who made a good opening. List topped off the movement with a good try in the corner\u201d.

The try was converted by Jim Amos to level the score 10-10. With the score 25-14 late in the match \u201cCooke came close to sending List in on the right flank\u201d. Third Test (Auckland, August 30). List was named in the New Zealand side to play the third test at Carlaw Park on August 20. List was once again on the right wing, opposite Barney Hudson. New Zealand lost the final test 20-18 after leading 18\u201317 with a minute to go before 12,000 spectators. List tackled well in the first half along with other New Zealand backs. At one stage he kicked well to get good field position and after New Zealand was awarded a penalty Watene kicked a goal to open the scoring. After the match the English financial manager, Mr. R.F. Anderton made several comments about the New Zealand side including saying that he was \u201cimpressed with Cooke, Brisbane and List. These players are worthy of inclusion in any international side\u201d.With the English tour over List returned to his Marist side to finish the season. He played in their semi final win in the Roope Rooster over Devonport on September 3. He scored a try and his play along that of Schultz \u201cwas a feature of the match\u201d. A week later Marist met City in the final and comfortably won 28\u20138 with List scoring a remarkable 4 tries. His first try came after Cornthwaite put him in under the posts, then Brisbane beat the defense and passed to List who scored again, then after a passing bout in the second half he got his third, before his last try late in the match after Webberley had made an error for City. Marist then met Devonport in the Stormont Shield final on September 17. Marist won their second trophy in as many weeks with a 15\u20138 win, with List scoring yet again.  On October 3 Marist travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki, going down 25\u201317. They then had a 37\u20138 win over Ponsonby in a Max Jaffe Cup charity match on October 8. List scored 2 tries and kicked 2 rare conversions. His final game of the season came in another charity match between Marist and a \u2018rest of Auckland\u2019 side on October 17.

For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington.. Three main conclusions were outlined: Climate change impacts are visible and the economic effects are becoming apparent.. The costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise.. Climate change will provide economic opportunities.:\u200a7\u200a. The economy of Washington State will dictate the effects of these impacts.   These effects are unique to Washington due to individual natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade.Climate change can directly affect the amount of resources that generate economic activity. Climate change can also affect the quality of important resources such as fresh drinking water, irrigation of crops and the generation of electricity. Climate change can also accelerate the depletion of capital assets used toward the formation of seawalls that are needed to protect shorelines from rising sea levels. Climate change can affect human health in ways that impact families and the workforce (e.g., premature death, increased sick days or leaves of absence, health care costs and insurance claims). All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington's gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State\u2014Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.

Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.  This valley owes its special characteristics (wide-open expanse, wildflowers and views) to its heavy snows and short growing season\u2014keeping it clear of trees.  Higher temperatures may mean that trees will take over these meadows, also preventing wildflowers from growing.  Scientists have already detected loss of mountain meadows on both the wetter and dryer east sides of the Olympic National Park.Forestlands comprise a significant element of Washington's economy. Out of Washington State's 43,000,000 acres (170,000 km2), 22,000,000 acres (89,000 km2) are classified as forestland. These forestlands support a great variety and number of economic activities, from timber production to the protection of freshwater supplies and wildlife habitat. In 2002, total employment in lumber, wood products pulp, and paper was 43,700. Timber collected on public land represents 16% of the current output from the lumber industry. Forest growth. Beyond affecting wildfires, climate change could impact the economic contribution of Washington's forests both directly (e.g., by affecting rates of tree growth and relative importance of different tree species) and indirectly (e.g., through impacts on the magnitude of pest or fire damage).  The impacts are unknown and may be either positive or negative.. One sees that climate change arises from changing temperature levels, soil moisture, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and other factors\u2014all of these things affecting tree growth. While estimates for changes in Washington forests are unavailable, other studies suggest the impacts to be significant.  A study of El Dorado County, California suggests a reduction of timber yields by 18-31% by the end of the 21st century, primarily because of increased summer temperatures. Pests. Beyond growth rates, climate change could affect Washington forests by changing the range and life cycle of pests.  Very little is known about the likely impacts here, and some changes could be positive, such as the possibility of the shifting of existing pests out of Washington's forests instead of attracting new pests in.  More likely to dominate, however, are the downside risks.  Washington's forests have evolved to deal with existing pests, causing the loss of such pests to be of little matter.  More detrimental, could be the introduction of new pests\u2014an example of which can be seen in British Columbia where the introduction of the mountain pine beetle, which is already native to nearly the entire Pacific coast of North America, has infested and decimated lodgepole pine forests.  This infestation is linked in large part to increasing temperatures. Electricity. Washington State relies on hydropower for 72% of its power and sales of hydropower to both households and businesses topped $4.3 billion in 2003. Washington State has the 9th lowest cost for electricity in the US. Climate change will have a negative effect on both the supply and demand of electricity in Washington.. The biggest factors determining the effects on electricity are annual temperature changes and the change in peak snowpack melt and stream flow. A change in precipitation could also have an effect on electricity supply and demand, but dramatic changes in overall precipitation are not expected. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council predicts a 300 megawatt (about 1% of Washington's generating capacity) reduction in electricity demands during the winter for each degree the temperature rises. Summer demands would probably increase due to more widespread need for air conditioning in order to keep homes and businesses cool, although estimates are still unknown.  Washington State's reliance on hydropower (66% of electricity generation) means that changes in peak snowpack melt and stream flows are important to the supply of electricity. Pg. 38. The available electricity supply could also be affected by climate change. Peak stream flows are in the summer.  Snowpack is likely to melt earlier in the future due to increased temperatures, thus shifting the peak stream flow to late winter and early spring, with decreased summer stream flow.  This would result in an increased availability of electricity in the early spring, when demand is dampened, and a decreased availability in the summer, when the demand may be highest."}]}, "correct": false}

The loss of these fisheries could then be assumed to potentially result in the loss of that revenue. In addition, as reported by the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, the numbers mentioned in these reports do not take into account the fact that recreational salmon and steelhead fishing is more costly than other sport fishing types and therefore accounts for more than their percentage of the total. In addition, these figures do not include economic totals from commercial or tribal fisheries. Local economics. Salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead and many other fish that are used economically will be negatively affected by the increase in temperatures. Southern species, including Hake and Mackerel are predators of baby salmon. Scientists say these species have been feeding on salmon migrating out of the Columbia River.  These fish need cold and clean water to reproduce successfully. The high and low flows of the rivers will be shifted in the seasons, negatively affecting salmon rearing. Increases in water temperatures could affect the food for fish in rivers, lakes, Puget Sound and coastal ocean regions. Fishing is big business in the Pacific Northwest and many local economies depend on fishing. There is a current debate on how to allocate the run of salmon. The local Native American tribes get a modest percentage of the statewide income from salmon fishing, with the majority going to commercial fishermen. The ones left out are the sport fishermen, those who participate in recreational fishing. The economic problem with this is that sport fishermen spend much more money per fish caught, and since they are less efficient, they drive the economy through the Spending multiplier throughout the local economy. The salmon allocation is hotly contested and when salmon populations are low, local economies suffer the majority of the impact. During 2007, the commercial fishermen caught 43% and the sport fishermen caught 57% of the total fish. Native Americans' treaties guarantee them a maximum of 50% of the total run before the commercial and sport fishers take their share, under the Boldt Decision of 1974. Human health. Impacts on infectious diseases  West Nile fever is a serious disease linked to climate change in the US that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It favors periods of drought and heavy rain, which are likely to become more common as increased average temperatures in Washington State result in rain replacing snowfall during the winter, resulting in drier summers (chance of drought, particularly east of the Cascades).  The mosquitoes will also survive longer because the warmer winters will not eliminate as many bugs as it usually does. Documentation of the West Nile virus is just beginning in Washington State, but Colorado has been grappling with cases of it since 2002. Total costs there have been estimated at $120 million or $670 million (P. 58), both as of 2006. Louisiana has been battling cases since 2001, with total costs of $190 million by 2006.  In the hopes of avoiding these costs, the Washington Department of Health spends $246,000 per year on surveillance for the virus and Epidemiological follow-up and testing on suspected human cases (P. 59). Dengue fever is an infectious disease also carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of four related dengue viruses. It is also called \"break-bone\" fever because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. Health experts have known about dengue fever for more than 200 years.. An epidemic in Hawaii in 2001 was a reminder that many locations in the United States are susceptible to dengue epidemics because they harbor the particular types of mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.. Worldwide, 50-100 million cases of dengue infection occur each year. This includes 100-200 cases in the United States, mostly in people who have recently traveled abroad. Many more cases probably go unreported, because some health care providers do not recognize the disease.. Impacts on respiratory illnesses, (such as asthma and allergies) . Washington's asthma prevalence is among the highest in the nation, costing the state over $400 million yearly. 400,000 adults and 120,000 children suffer from it in Washington. Though increases in average yearly temperatures is the hallmark of global warming, human activities are the cause of greenhouse gases like emissions from cars, power plants, and airborne particles from human-caused forest fires. Global warming has a \"direct\" effect on respiratory illnesses because increased CO2 levels stimulate pollen production, which stimulates allergies. More frequent flooding in WA State will increase the growth of fungus, also exacerbating allergies. Increased carbon dioxide levels have already and will continue to increase the level of pollen output in the state."}, {"summary_score": 0.7535282718150913, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7474567877513442, "text_rank": 3, "summary": "Between 1998 and 2004, clean energy jobs grew by 45%.

To reduce the impacts of climate change, the state of Washington has enacted several pieces of legislation in recent years. These pieces cover areas such as construction, waste, water, air quality, and so on. There are different policies to pursue specifically in Washington State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to reduce GHG emissions have to take place in Washington as well as across the globe in order to minimize further warming.. As Washington State backs the need to decrease carbon emissions, the legislature is searching for ways to fund the formation of renewable energy sources. The bill SHB 1032, which would tax families and businesses to generate financial support for new renewable energy sources, has raised several concerns for taxpayers and ratepayers, and also questions as to whether this will efficiently reduce CO2. This bill would begin to tax every utility customer approximately $1.90 a month, regardless of how much energy the customer uses. This incongruous attempt would leave industrial users paying the same as poverty-level families, and is arguable for several reasons.. First, such taxation will hit low-income families more heavily than wealthy families. Second, because the fee is a surcharge, there is no way to reduce the fee by taking affirmative action in reduction of energy use. This leaves no incentive for people to reduce their use, but may in fact increase people's use since they are paying the same amount as everyone else.. Analysis of SHB 1032: Adding Subsidies for Renewable Energy Production. Executive Order 07\u201302, signed by Governor Gregoire on February 7, 2007, presented goals of decreasing emissions that contribute to global warming overall, as well as decreasing the use of foreign oil allowing for more employment in fields that make clean energy such as hydropower and solar power. Washington State has also encouraged public participation in the incorporation of clean energy practices into citizen's daily lives. The Climate Advisory Team (CAT) put together a collection of incentives for factories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

This issue is further compounded by the projected increase in population in the Puget Sound region. The text also highlights the impact of climate change on Seattle's water supply, stating that the city's water sources, the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds, will experience decreased water levels due to global warming.

A lack of water will be problematic for both humans and the region's wildlife. This issue is also concerning because as water levels decrease, there is an expected increase in population in the Puget Sound region. The municipal water supply problem will affect different regions differently depending on the amount of public served by them and the amount of water supply that they can tap into. Everett for example, has a population of 100,000 and the Sultan river provides it with a vast amount of water compared to its population, so global warming will have a minimal effect on the supply of water to it. The Seattle region gets the bulk of its water from the Cedar River and Tolt River watersheds. As the effects of global warming cause water levels to decrease in these watersheds, new water sources must be found. One idea proposed by a utility consortium, Cascade Water Alliance, is to use Lake Tapps, located in Pierce County as a new source of drinkable water. The project is projected to cost $450 million and take decades to complete. These reservoirs are very important to the continued stability of the municipal water supply. Reservoirs hold the early spring melt of snow so that in the summer months it can be released when the snowpack is gone. Reservoirs must be made larger to hold more of the early spring runoff. This will cost millions, if not billions, of dollars to the states' taxpayers. This, however, will only help slightly. It is projected that by the year 2040 snowpack levels that used to dip to a dangerously low level appeared every 50 years will do so every 5. No matter the size of the reservoir, if there is not enough water to fill them then they will be of little help. The other alternative to curtailing water usage would be to increase the price the consumer has to pay for the water. Snow and ice. Washington State is one of the nine contiguous states that has mountainous glaciers. These glaciers of the Olympic Range and the Northern Cascades produce 30 billion cubic feet (850,000,000 m3) of water every year. These glaciers are losing their size rapidly. The Southern Cascade Glacier in Darington has lost two-thirds of its volume. The glaciers in these ranges have, on average, decreased by 31 feet (9.4 m) and between 18 and 32% of their volume of water. An increase of 3.6 \u00b0F (2.0 \u00b0C) will cause 65% to 75% of the glaciers to disappear in 40 years. The retreat of the glaciers will help to increase the decline. Glaciers reflect the incoming light from the sun. With less glacial cover the rocks on the mountain will heat up causing the surrounding frozen ice to melt even faster. Drainage basins that use glacial runoff will also be affected. Glaciers contribute to a base level of water that runs off after all of the new snow cover has melted. The Middle Fork River is likely to see huge decreases in its water levels in the coming years due to this issue. The Middle Fork provides a large amount of drinking water to Bellingham.. Precipitation in the Cascades has begun to be altered drastically. While the level of precipitation on the Cascades has not decreased since the 1950s, it has begun to shift from snow to ice when it falls. The level of glacial runoff is also on the uptick since the 1950s. The level of water that flows into Puget Sound has decreased by 18% since 1949.. Water flows can be split up into three categories in Washington: Rain dominant, snow dominant, and transient snowmelt watersheds. The change in water falling will make snow dominant regions appear to be more like transition rivers and transition more like rain dominant. Snow dominant regions have their highest water flow several months after their highest snowfall. Due to the increase in temperature, they will change and act more like transition which has two peak flows, one in the spring due to snowmelt, and the other in the winter due to water falling as rain, not snow. The transition region now will act like rain regions which have their high points in river flows right after it rains. Agriculture. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale.  Agriculture is probably responsive to climate variability and weather extremes, such as droughts, floods, and severe storms. The forces that shape the climate are also critical to farm productivity. Human activity has already changed atmospheric characteristics such as temperature, rainfall, levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ground level ozone."}, {"summary_score": 0.8406008137737586, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8295075110504164, "text_rank": 3, "summary": "The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group's 2013 report provides the latest analysis on climate change impacts in Washington State.

For the most up to date and comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on Washington State, see the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group 2013 assessment report, available here.. Economic Impacts of Climate Change (2007) in Washington State summarized impacts on forest fires, public health, agriculture, municipal water supply, sea level rise and fisheries.  These conclusions have been reached through several predictions, based primarily on temperature and precipitation models for climate change.  The expected warming of 0.5 \u00b0F (0.2 \u00b0C) every ten years is the main source for any visible impacts.  Although total annual precipitation is not expected to change significantly, the increase of temperatures will result in a more minimal snowpack leading to more rain. Visible physical impacts on the environment within Washington State include glacier reduction, declining snowpack, earlier spring runoff, an increase in large wildfires, and rising sea levels which affect the Puget Sound area. According to The Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Washington State, the major impacts of climate change in Washington State  (2007) include: Increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.. Increase in temperatures: An estimated 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) by 2020 and up to 3 \u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) by 2040.. Earlier annual snow melt.. Sea level rise of about 3 inches to 3 feet (0.91 m) by 2100.. No change in volume of precipitation.Less snowpack will also result in a time change of water flow volumes into freshwater systems, resulting in greater winter river volume, and less volume during summer's driest months, generally from July through October.  These changes will result in both economic and ecological repercussions, most notably found in hydrological power output, municipal water supply and migration of fish.. Collectively, these changes are negatively affecting agriculture, forest resources, dairy farming, the Washington wine industry, electricity, water supply, and other areas of the state.In 2006, a group of scientists and economists published The Impacts of Climate Change on Washington\u2019s Economy, a preliminary assessment on the possible risks and opportunities given a rise in global temperatures occurs, and more specifically, the effects for the state of Washington.. Three main conclusions were outlined: Climate change impacts are visible and the economic effects are becoming apparent.. The costs of climate change will grow as temperatures and sea levels rise.. Climate change will provide economic opportunities.:\u200a7\u200a. The economy of Washington State will dictate the effects of these impacts.   These effects are unique to Washington due to individual natural resources, climate patterns, industries, and trade.Climate change can directly affect the amount of resources that generate economic activity. Climate change can also affect the quality of important resources such as fresh drinking water, irrigation of crops and the generation of electricity. Climate change can also accelerate the depletion of capital assets used toward the formation of seawalls that are needed to protect shorelines from rising sea levels. Climate change can affect human health in ways that impact families and the workforce (e.g., premature death, increased sick days or leaves of absence, health care costs and insurance claims). All of these things also impair quality of life.Washington state has a varied and active economy of approximately $268.5 billion. Washington's gross state product is the sum of twenty-one economic sectors ranging from mining ($400 million in 2004) to real estate, rental, and leasing ($38.8 billion) in 2004. The extent of vulnerability in dealing with climate-related issues is hard to assess for each sector individually. National and international trade and inter-sector links stretch out the vulnerability to climate change effects. National parks. Global warming threatens to disrupt the natural habitat of three national parks in Washington State\u2014Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades.  It appears that the natural flow and pathways that water has taken through these parks in the past will be disrupted.  Global warming has thrown glacier melting into fast forward, and it appears we could lose many streams as well as glaciers in these parks.. In the North Cascades National Park, experts estimate that some streams get about half of their late-summer flow from glaciers. Since 1959, the glaciers have lost 80% of their ice, and in Thunder Creek specifically, receding glaciers reduced summer streams on a whole by 31%.  At Mount Rainier National Park the mountain's glaciers lost 21% of their area between 1913 and 1994, and in Olympic National Park, glacier retreat has been recorded for Blue Glacier as well as others.. Beyond glacial retreat, we may see a shift in the expansive meadows that exist in Paradise Valley.

Although Seattle is exceeding their goal of reducing GHG emissions, population growth fueled with their resistance to alternate methods of transportation is threatening their Kyoto goals.. For a cap and trade situation or even a tax to be truly effective they need to affect the individuals of the populations. Applying a tax to gas would greatly reduce the population's willingness to drive and make alternatives to drive more attractive. Also incentives to purchase hybrid cars, use biodiesel, and other climate friendly alternatives will greatly reduce fossil fuel dependence and use. Responses to climate change in Washington. Job growth. Forbes magazine ranked Washington State the fifth best state in the nation for business, and 3rd for environmental quality.  The emerging \"green economy\" (green collar jobs) designed to achieve efforts toward low carbon and sustainability is anchored by clean energy. WA is a national leader in addressing climate change and has taken steps to reduce its climate impact, and as a result opportunities for growth in the economy have been generated. Sustainable family wage jobs are developed through a focus on cleaner energy, smarter use of natural resources, and adoption of advanced technology. State Energy Policy Office studies documented 3,800 clean energy jobs in 1998 and 8,400 jobs in 2004. The Washington Climate Advisory Team (CAT) expects the state to meet Governor Gregoire's job creation goal of 25,000 clean energy jobs by 2020. And, Washington could potentially reach 31,000 family-wage jobs by 2025.. Clean Energy Sectors Include: Energy efficiency.

The Seattle Climate Action Plan includes five main strategies to cut emissions:\n\n1. Reducing Seattle's dependence on cars: Seattle plans to increase public transportation, invest $1.5 million to improve transit services, promote alternatives like Sound Transit\u2019s Link light rail, and implement a 10% commercial parking tax. The goal is to reduce emissions by 170,000 tons per year.\n2. Increasing fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels: Seattle aims to increase the biodiesel blend, promote biodiesel usage, and replace non-pursuit vehicles with gas-electric hybrids in the police department. These measures are expected to reduce emissions by 200,600 tons per year.\n3. Achieving more efficient and cleaner energy for homes and businesses: City Light has committed to acquiring 7.5 megawatts through conservation measures and converting fossil fuel boilers to biofuel. These actions aim to cut emissions by 316,000 tons per year.\n4. Extending the city's leadership: Seattle Public Utilities will evaluate its GHG emissions and create a reduction plan.

Seattle's Climate Action Plan consists of: reducing Seattle's dependence on cars, increasing fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels, achieving more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle's homes and businesses, building on Seattle's leadership policy action, and to sustain Seattle's commitment policy action.. Seattle's first plan is to reduce Seattle's dependence on cars which is projected to cut emission by 170,000 tons. Their first plan of action is to significantly increase the supply of frequent, reliable and convenient public transportation. The single largest source of Seattle's GHG's come from the approximate two billion miles driven by gasoline fueled cars and trucks. The success of reducing this is to supply an alternative to driving. The city plans to invest $1.5 million to increase transit services and Transit Now plans to match the $1.5 million if the ballot passes in Seattle. Another alternative to driving is Sound Transit\u2019s Link light rail system that will operate between downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The city will also implement a 10% commercial parking tax to set in over a three-year period beginning July 2007. Seattle also plans to rezone certain areas to provide neighborhoods easy access to transits, light rail systems, and provide amenities close enough to walk or bike. Mayor Nickels has allocated $100,000 to work with regional partners in an effort to explore and develop road pricing scenarios. Road pricing can take the form of tolling based on road congestion, the time of day, or even miles driven. These courses of action are to increase the incentives to substitute driving for a much more environmentally friendly commute.Seattle's second plan is to increase fuel efficiency and the use of biofuels; the projected cut in emissions is expected be 200,600 tons. Seattle will start by increasing the biodiesel blend from 20 percent biodiesel to as much as 40 percent in 2007. The use of biodiesel is growing and Seattle wants to promote the use of biodiesel by making it state law to require at least 2 percent by volume of diesel sales to be biodiesel. The port of Seattle uses B99 biodiesel (99% biodiesel 1% petroleum diesel) for its own use and also cuts emissions by turning off their diesel engines when in port by using electricity from Seattle City Light.  The electricity from Seattle City Light reduces GHG emissions from ferries by 30 percent.  The Seattle Police department will begin replacing all of its non-pursuit vehicles to efficient gas-electric hybrids in 2007.  Seattle will also provide incentives for taxicab owners to use gas-electric hybrids, and will also work in conjunction with taxi companies to decrease the amount of GHG emitted from their vehicles.Seattle's third plan is to achieve a more efficient and cleaner energy for Seattle homes and businesses which is projected to cut GHG emissions by 316,000 tons. City Light has committed to acquire at least an average of 7.5 megawatts through conservation measures in 2007 and 2008, and they have already achieved its net-zero emissions status for 2007 by offsetting whatever emissions they produced by reducing emissions elsewhere. City Light spends about $2 per customer per year to meet its approximate carbon offset of 200,000 metric tons. City Light will continue to purchase 3 percent of its energy from Stateline Wind, a wind energy company. Seattle Steam Company, which provides heat and hot water to customers, will convert one of its fossil fuel boilers to an urban wood waste biofuel that will cut GHG emissions by 50,000 metric tons a year.. Seattle's fourth plan is to extend the city's leadership. Seattle's second largest department, Seattle Public Utilities, will evaluate its own greenhouse gas emission inventory and create a reduction target and action plan. Seattle plans on purchasing carbon-offset projects to compensate emissions from all business-related air travel by City employees. Seattle also plans to launch a campaign to encourage all City employees to reduce climate pollution not only on the job but also at home. Also, a new Department of Executive Administration green team will assess, and decide on whether to purchase climate friendly products, such as super-efficient \"80-plus\" computers and servers.Seattle's fifth plan is to inspire action.

They stated that he was accorded full due process under the law and was represented by legal counsel throughout. They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face.

Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law.

The whole appeal itself was dismissed by the High Court, as the judge See Kee Oon made it clear that the case has exhausted all its avenues of appeal since 2019 and hence there is no legal basis to not execute Nagaenthran based on allegations that his mental state has deteriorated during his time on death row and thus made him ineligible for execution, because there is no evidence present to the courts about these claims. There is also no medical basis to support the claim that Nagaenthran's mental age is below 18 years old since this was based on his lawyer's opinion.

Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances.

Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court."}, {"summary_score": 0.8464975700419431, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8418934389370099, "text_rank": 3, "summary": "Nagaenthran was executed on April 27, 2022, at Changi Prison, becoming the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after a two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran's sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran's remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh.

M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a \"disgraceful act\" which was \"ruthlessly carried out\" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice."}]}, "correct": false}

Activists in Malaysia held a small vigil the night before his execution, and Nagaenthran's family planned to take his body back to their hometown for funeral preparations.", "text": "Lawsuit against Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be \"devoid of merit\". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that \"no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum\" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: \"There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word.\" Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a \"calculated attempt\" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to \"stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice.\"After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: \"I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?\"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of \"harassing\" and \"intimidating\" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child. Execution. Thirteen years after his arrest for drug trafficking, on 27 April 2022, at around dawn, Nagaenthran was hanged at Changi Prison. He was the second death row prisoner to be executed in Singapore after Abdul Kahar Othman, who was the first to be hanged after the end of Singapore's two-year moratorium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Nagaenthran was the fifth Malaysian drug trafficker to be hanged in Singapore since 2016.According to Nagaenthran's 22-year-old brother Navinkumar, his family would collect his brother's body and take it back to their hometown in Ipoh for funeral preparations."}]}, "correct": true}

British billionaire Richard Branson and British actor Stephen Fry, who both earlier appealed for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, once again went to social media to reiterate their pleas for Nagaenthran's sentence be commuted. Additionally, in his appeal for mercy on behalf of Nagaenthran, Branson described the death penalty as a \"horrible blotch\" on the reputation of Singapore as a huge financial hub. Human rights groups also asked Singapore to transfer Nagaenthran to a Malaysian prison on a prisoner exchange programme to allow him to be executed in Malaysia instead of Singapore.The protests against Nagaenthran's execution grew fiercer as the death warrant of Datchinamurthy Kataiah, another Malaysian drug convict on death row, was also finalized and his execution date scheduled on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution date. The vigil was held as scheduled, with several public figures like rapper Subhas Nair, opposition politician Paul Tambyah and writer Alfian Sa'at attending the vigil. Some Singaporeans showed up out of sympathy for Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy, while others joined only to find out more about the concept of the death penalty in Singapore.Nagaenthran's family were unable to attend the vigil since the law prohibits the participation of foreigners in local protests, but on behalf of the family, Nagaenthran's cousin Thenmoli Sunniah stated that the family would not give up their hope for Nagaenthran's case, since they planned to file another legal application to the courts. Datchinamurthy's family similarly stood by Nagaenthran's family to show support for the vigil and protest against the two men's executions. It was also revealed that both Datchinamurthy and Nagaenthran were close friends while staying next to each other in neighbouring cells at the death row section of Changi Prison, and both men's mothers bonded due to their loss and common goal to save their sons from execution.Sebaran Kasih, a non-governmental organisation, appealed for all political and business leaders to bring forward diplomatic measures to intervene in Nagaenthran's case, and they cited the 2010 cases of Cheong Chun Yin and Pang Siew Fum to question why Nagaenthran cannot be eligible for life imprisonment like both Cheong and Pang since their cases were similar in terms of their circumstances. Cheong and Pang were both initially sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2010 before the 2013 law reforms allowed them to have their sentences commuted to life, the former due to him being a certified courier and the latter due to her mental illness. A protest was made by Malaysian activists, lawyers and members of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) outside the Singapore High Commission in Malaysia to show opposition to Nagaenthran's execution. However, as a result of this protest, the Royal Malaysia Police sent out officers to take three lawyers into custody for questioning regarding their roles in the protest.The United Nations Human Rights Office also issued an official statement, in which they showed opposition to the Singapore government's decision to proceed with the executions of both Nagaenthran and Datchinamurthy due to their concern that Singapore may conduct more executions in the near future with the increasing phenomenon of death warrants issued for drug convicts on death row, and they urged Singapore to reconsider their drug laws and use of the death penalty in the city state.

Upon receiving news of the death warrant, Malaysian lawyers and both international and local anti-death penalty activists - including World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and FIDH - tried to appeal to the Singapore government for clemency, reiterating that Nagaenthran was mentally disabled and should not be hanged for his crime since he could not understand what he was going through, as well as insisting on his innocence. An online petition was made to plead to President Halimah Yacob to spare the Malaysian's life, garnering more than 102,000 signatures. There is an intention to bring forward the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Singapore for not conforming with the international norms to not practice the death penalty. There are also concerns that Nagaenthran's execution might violate international human rights and law, which rules that any mentally unfit capital offenders should not be executed. In United States, Divisions of Social Justice of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) called Nagaenthran's case a \"flagrant breach\" of human rights. Aside from this, there were repeated calls from these human rights groups to pressurise Singapore to abolish the death penalty.Public figures like Singaporean rapper-musician Subhas Nair and British billionaire Richard Branson, as well as more than 200 friends and family members of other death row convicts (including those executed prior) like Angelia Pranthaman (sister of condemned drug trafficker Pannir Selvam Pranthaman) and the relatives of executed killer Kho Jabing, also asked for Singapore to show mercy on Nagaenthran. Protests were made outside Malaysia's Parliament at Kuala Lumpur for more efforts from the Malaysian government to stop the execution.Nagaenthran's sister Sarmila Dharmalingam said she and her siblings had been delaying the news of their brother's execution from their mother, and did not provide any reasons why she had to travel to Singapore. They only told her five days after the letter arrived at Ipoh, and Nagaenthran's mother took the news badly. There were also diplomats sent by the Malaysian embassy to provide consular support for Nagaenthran's family, who arrived in Singapore with the help and funding of abolitionist advocate Kirsten Han and her activist group. Within a short span of two days, Han and her fellow activists managed to raise more than $14,000 for flights, quarantine hotel rooms and other arrangements, including a funeral, on behalf of Nagaenthran's family. This allowed Nagaenthran's mother to fly to Singapore to see her son for the first time in three years.One of Nagaenthran's brothers Navinkumar Dharmalingam told activist Kokila Annamalai that when he visited his brother in prison, he observed that his brother seemed to be completely disoriented compared to the last time they visited him. He said his brother was incoherent, smiled irrelevantly at times and unable to make any eye contact, and he did not seem to clearly remember some of the people he knew except for his mother, whom Nagaenthran entrusted to his brother's care during their visit. An unnamed death row convict who lived in a neighbouring cell next to Nagaenthran reportedly told Navinkumar that Nagaenthran was introverted and often kept to himself at times, and in fact, he has not spoken to anyone in over a year. Nagaenthran's lawyer M Ravi, who observed his client acting like a \"five-year-old child\", feared that Nagaenthran may not be aware of his death and the 11-year period he spent on death row may have had a deteriorating effect on his mental health. Amnesty International's researcher of Singapore, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, commented on the court verdicts of Naganethran's case where they dismissed his reports of diminished responsibility, \"Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable.\"The execution date, six days after the annual Hindu festival Deepavali (which Nagaenthran and his family celebrated annually), was criticised; the family said that they could not celebrate the festival.

M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death.

Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government.

McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice."}]}, "correct": false}

Nagaenthran's 36-year-old sister Sharmila said that the family was saddened and shocked at their loss, and they were dissatisfied with Nagaenthran's final sentence despite coming to terms with his death. The funeral was expected to be held on 29 April 2022, two days after Nagaenthran's execution. A wake was conducted for Nagaenthran in Singapore before the body was brought back to Malaysia, with over a hundred people attending it, including human rights activists, family members, and members of the public. Nagaenthran's sister revealed that after the funeral, Nagaenthran's remains would be laid to rest in a Hindu cemetery in Buntong, Ipoh. Over 200 family members and friends were present at the funeral. Reportedly, Sharmila did not allow a single politician to attend the funeral, claiming they're coming only for publicity but did not offer assistance while Nagaenthran was on death row.In the year 2022 itself, a total of eleven executions, including Nagaenthran's, were officially carried out in Singapore, all for drug trafficking. Aftermath. Criticism of the execution. Reprieve's director Maya Foa criticized the execution and described Nagaenthran as a \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". M Ravi offered his condolences to the family and said he would continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in Singapore. Activist Kirsten Han also offered her condolences by posting a photo of Nagaenthran wearing his favourite clothes, which was the final photo taken before his death. The Malaysian government also received calls from related parties to abolish the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution, with PKR leader and deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse describing it as an irrelevant punishment due to it not being effective in reducing crime. Wisma Putra also offered their condolences to Nagaenthran's family and provided them consular support.Additionally, British billionaire Richard Branson, who earlier appealed for clemency in Nagaenthran's case, offered his condolences to Nagaenthran's family and he expressed his disappointment in Singapore for its \"relentless machinery of death\" since it left \"no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy\" when it sent Nagaenthran to the gallows in spite of the growing opposition to his execution. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (Adpan) condemned the execution and stated that Nagaenthran's execution was a violation of international law by the Singapore government. Director Erwin van der Borght of Amnesty International commented that the execution of Nagaenthran was a \"disgraceful act\" which was \"ruthlessly carried out\" by the Singapore government despite the widespread international outcry and protests.Australian human rights lawyer Julian McMahon, who formerly represented drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of the Bali Nine (executed in 2015 by firing squad in Indonesia), and Van Tuong Nguyen (executed in 2005 by hanging in Singapore), spoke up against the issue of the death penalty in light of Nagaenthran's execution. McMahon stated that he felt that the death penalty was ineffective in preventing drug trafficking given the offenders dealt with were just the runners but not the kingpins, and he added that it was shocking to see the death penalty being put into use for relatively \"non-serious\" crimes like drug trafficking.Another Australian lawyer Morry Bailes was also critical of the use of the death penalty by both Singapore and Japan in light of Nagaenthran's execution by Singapore for drug trafficking, as well as Japan's execution of three murderers the previous year. Bailes stated that the claims of the death penalty as an effective deterrent was greatly contradicted by the experience of many other countries, and he stated that hanging a mere drug mule like Nagaenthran would not be able to achieve the ends of justice since the mastermind and drug lord who hired Nagaenthran to deliver the drugs was not brought to justice."}]}, "correct": false}

They were ordered to pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers. Activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated for organizing assemblies against the death penalty without a permit. In response to court process abuses, the government passed the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill, allowing only the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of execution and hear post-appeal applications, with stricter regulations and a single judge appointment for initial review. This move received support but also criticism for limiting inmates' access to justice.", "text": "Legal proceedings against Nagaenthran's former counsel. On 10 May 2022, it was reported that Violet Netto, the lawyer who represented Nagaenthran in his second-last appeal to the Court of Appeal, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer and solicitor without a valid practising certificate on at least three occasions, including Nagaenthran's case and the last-ditch appeals of another two death row inmates Pausi Jefridin and Roslan Bakar. It was decreed under the law that solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year they act in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and Netto's certificate was expired at the time she represented Nagaenthran. For this, she potentially faced the maximum sentence of six months' jail, a S$2,500 fine, or both if convicted of acting as a lawyer without a valid certificate.Not only that, M Ravi, the human rights lawyer who also represented Nagaenthran before Netto, was subjected to seven separate professional disciplinary inquiries which may result in him being fined, suspended or struck off the Bar as a lawyer, in addition to three contempt proceedings as well as a number of police investigations for the repeated abuse of court processes through Nagaenthran's case. Ravi was also given a travel ban which restricted him from going to Malaysia. Due to these above proceedings against Nagaenthran's former lawyers, the rights groups and Malaysian lawyers criticised Singapore for supposed harassment of lawyers and stated that Singapore should respect the criminals' rights to legal representation, since Nagaenthran's mother and another prisoner Datchinamurthy Kataiah find themselves, in two separate cases, without the representation of legal counsel to argue their cases.On 25 May 2022, the Court of Appeal released a court order, in which they ruled that Ravi and Netto should pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) as compensation to the unnecessary costs incurred by the lawsuits both lawyers made without solid evidence in Nagaenthran's case; Ravi was to bear 75% of the total cost while the remaining 25% would be covered by Netto. A small-scale public funding event was carried out to gather funds to help Ravi and Netto to discharge their fine; some activists criticised Singapore for punishing the two lawyers for merely fulfilling their duties for their former client. Also, Ravi, who also need to pay S$10,000 and S$12,000 for another two lawsuits separately, remained defiant and unapologetic, stating that he paid a heavy price in saving lives from capital punishment despite the government's condemnation of his errors. Police probe of activists. On 27 June 2022, it was reported that several people including activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated by police for illegally organising three public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit to show their opposition to the death penalty and support for drug traffickers Abdul Kahar Othman and Nagaenthran before their executions on 30 March 2022 and 27 April 2022 respectively. Han and Howe were also asked by police to submit their anti-death penalty slogan shirts, handphones and other possessions as evidence for upcoming police investigations. Passing of the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill. In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate's execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal. The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022. While this law was supported by most like Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, there were criticisms from Human Rights Watch that Singapore did so to cut off inmates' chances to oppose their execution and access to last chances of justice."}]}, "correct": false}

On 25 April 2022, Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam filed a lawsuit against Sundaresh Menon, the current Chief Justice of Singapore, as a final attempt to help her son escape the gallows. In the lawsuit, which she made with the help of family members, activists and friends, she alleged that Menon was the same attorney general who, prior to his appointment as Chief Justice, prosecuted Nagaenthran and secured his conviction, which she claimed was a move that \"blatantly\" deprived her son's rights to a fair trial. However, Panchalai did not have a lawyer to represent her in filing the application since none of the lawyers in Singapore were willing to represent her for fear of any reprisals from the court, as the courts would often issue hefty fines and other penalties for any legal applications filed without merit. Hence, Panchalai would be representing herself in the hearing, which was set for the next day and also the day before Nagaenthran's execution.On 26 April 2022, the day before Nagaenthran's execution, the Court of Appeal dismissed Nagaenthran's mother's lawsuit. The three-judge panel, consisting of Supreme Court judge Belinda Ang, and two Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, overall found the application to be \"devoid of merit\". Justice Phang, who delivered the verdict, described in his own words that \"no court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum\" by filing applications that were baseless and without merit. He also stated: \"There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word.\" Justice Phang added that Nagaenthran did not raise this allegation in his previous appeal the month before, which made the application look like a \"calculated attempt\" to downplay the finality of the court process.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Wong Woon Kwong harshly criticized Nagaenthran's mother for filing a meritless lawsuit, and he stated that CJ Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution, hence the lawsuit was a sign of the continuation of abuse of the court process by Nagaenthran through the involvement of external parties. DPP Wong also urged the court to compel Nagaenthran's mother to disclose the identities of those who played a part in submitting the lawsuit, so as to \"stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice.\"After the dismissal of this lawsuit, Nagaenthran, who accepted the verdict, made a final request to the Court of Appeal, being quoted as saying: \"I'd like to make a last-minute request to spend some time with my family members. I'm placing this request so I can hold my family members' hands. Here in court, Your Honour, I would like to hold my family members' hands, not in prison. May I please have permission to hold their hands here?\"After making the request, the three judges allowed Nagaenthran to spend two hours together with his family in the Supreme Court building and he was given permission to hold their hands one final time. As the time was up, Nagaenthran reportedly shared a tearful farewell with his family before he was brought back to Changi Prison, where his execution would take place.Upon the news of his lawsuit's rejection, a small vigil was held by activists in Malaysia on the night before his execution. Fifty people attended the event, and there were two Malaysian lawyers being probed by the police for taking part in the vigil. Lawyers for Liberty also accused the Singapore authorities of \"harassing\" and \"intimidating\" Nagaenthran's mother into revealing the names of those who assisted her into filing the lawsuit, claiming the intention of such aid were made out of compassion for a helpless mother desperate to save her child.

On 10 May 2022, it was reported that Violet Netto, the lawyer who represented Nagaenthran in his second-last appeal to the Court of Appeal, was arrested and investigated for acting as a lawyer and solicitor without a valid practising certificate on at least three occasions, including Nagaenthran's case and the last-ditch appeals of another two death row inmates Pausi Jefridin and Roslan Bakar. It was decreed under the law that solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year they act in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor, and Netto's certificate was expired at the time she represented Nagaenthran. For this, she potentially faced the maximum sentence of six months' jail, a S$2,500 fine, or both if convicted of acting as a lawyer without a valid certificate.Not only that, M Ravi, the human rights lawyer who also represented Nagaenthran before Netto, was subjected to seven separate professional disciplinary inquiries which may result in him being fined, suspended or struck off the Bar as a lawyer, in addition to three contempt proceedings as well as a number of police investigations for the repeated abuse of court processes through Nagaenthran's case. Ravi was also given a travel ban which restricted him from going to Malaysia. Due to these above proceedings against Nagaenthran's former lawyers, the rights groups and Malaysian lawyers criticised Singapore for supposed harassment of lawyers and stated that Singapore should respect the criminals' rights to legal representation, since Nagaenthran's mother and another prisoner Datchinamurthy Kataiah find themselves, in two separate cases, without the representation of legal counsel to argue their cases.On 25 May 2022, the Court of Appeal released a court order, in which they ruled that Ravi and Netto should pay over S$20,000 in costs to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) as compensation to the unnecessary costs incurred by the lawsuits both lawyers made without solid evidence in Nagaenthran's case; Ravi was to bear 75% of the total cost while the remaining 25% would be covered by Netto. A small-scale public funding event was carried out to gather funds to help Ravi and Netto to discharge their fine; some activists criticised Singapore for punishing the two lawyers for merely fulfilling their duties for their former client. Also, Ravi, who also need to pay S$10,000 and S$12,000 for another two lawsuits separately, remained defiant and unapologetic, stating that he paid a heavy price in saving lives from capital punishment despite the government's condemnation of his errors. Police probe of activists. On 27 June 2022, it was reported that several people including activists Kirsten Han and Rocky Howe were investigated by police for illegally organising three public assemblies outside Changi Prison without a police permit to show their opposition to the death penalty and support for drug traffickers Abdul Kahar Othman and Nagaenthran before their executions on 30 March 2022 and 27 April 2022 respectively. Han and Howe were also asked by police to submit their anti-death penalty slogan shirts, handphones and other possessions as evidence for upcoming police investigations. Passing of the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill. In the aftermath of Nagaenthran's execution, in light of the increasing rate of abuses of court processes evidently caused by Nagaenthran's case and the subsequent other capital drug cases (all of which having exhausted the appeals and clemency process), the government of Singapore decided to pass a new law to impose stringent regulations on the filing of post-appeal applications, where only the Court of Appeal, the highest court of Singapore, could grant a stay of execution for a prisoner awaiting capital punishment in Singapore, as well as hearing the post-appeal applications. If a prisoner is found to have abused court processes, he will be prohibited from making a post-appeal application unless there is new evidence. A single judge would be appointed to hear the cases before deciding whether to postpone the inmate's execution and approve his post-appeal application, before the usual panel of three or five judges would be set to hear the application in the Court of Appeal. The Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill was first drafted and passed on 29 November 2022. While this law was supported by most like Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, there were criticisms from Human Rights Watch that Singapore did so to cut off inmates' chances to oppose their execution and access to last chances of justice."}]}, "correct": true}

They also reiterated the main points of the final court verdict in relation to Nagaenthran's case, stating that Nagaenthran did not commit the act under duress, and was not substantially mentally impaired to the extent of being ineligible for execution, and he clearly understood the magnitude of his actions, hence there was no necessity to review his case since his avenues of appeal were all exhausted. The amount of heroin which Nagaenthran trafficked in Singapore is equivalent to about 3,560 straws of heroin and it would be sufficient to feed the addiction of about 510 abusers for a week. His execution date remained as scheduled on 10 November 2021, as confirmed by the MHA.Singapore also emphasised that the death penalty is the reason why it has one of the lowest crime rates globally, and the practice is necessary to clamp down on drug crimes that can destroy thousands of lives potentially if not strictly regulated and deterred. MHA said the penalties, including the death penalty, for the illegal trafficking, importation or exportation of drugs are made clear at Singapore's borders, to warn traffickers and syndicates of the harsh penalties they potentially face. The Singapore authorities also revealed that they have also set execution dates ahead for some other death row inmates (who were all not named) who also exhausted all their avenues of appeal.On 31 October 2021, Malaysian lawyer Mahajoth Singh had launched a one-man protest against the execution of Nagaenthran in front of the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in Kuala Lumpur.. Malaysian lawyer N Surendran continued to ask for mercy on Nagaenthran's life, stating that there was no justification to execute Nagaenthran based on his mental disability in view of the government of Singapore's response to public pressure. Lawyers for Liberty from Malaysia condemned the Singapore government for their response to the pleas of mercy and ignorance of Nagaenthran's mental faculties. Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob appealed to Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to review Nagaenthran's case and revoke his death sentence. Ismail stated he, as a lawyer, respects Singapore's law and does not want to interfere but he hoped that the authorities can give Nagaenthran a chance to review his case. Similarly, Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysia's foreign minister, appealed to his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan to give their authorities a discretion in deciding clemency for Nagaenthran's case, but overall he maintained Malaysia's respect for Singapore's law. The European Union, which prohibits the death penalty among its member nations, also joined in to pressure Singapore to pardon Nagaenthran from the gallows. Last-minute appeal and COVID-19 infection.

Dharmalingam, an ethnic Indian Malaysian and native of Ipoh, was born on 13 September 1988. He was the second of four children and had two younger brothers (one of them named Navinkumar) and an elder sister Sharmila. His father died sometime during Nagaenthran's death row imprisonment in Singapore.. According to the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network's video interview of Nagaenthran's mother Panchalai Supermaniam, she often went out for work and had to entrust Nagaenthran and his siblings to the care of the children's grandmother and their relatives during his childhood. After Nagaenthran got older, Panchalai would be the one taking care of him but she did not speak to him much due to her work. Nagaenthran completed his five-year secondary school education at age 17 and he went to work at a factory.Later, Nagaenthran decided to go to Singapore to find employment, against the wishes of his family, especially his mother who did not want him to leave his hometown for a distant place. Nagaenthran found a job as a security guard in Singapore and would regularly visit his family in Ipoh. According to his sister, he last returned to Malaysia and visited his family in 2008 during Deepavali, and that was the last time he stepped foot in his hometown before his arrest for drug trafficking. Arrest and trial. On 22 April 2009, 20-year-old Nagaenthran was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers when he was travelling from Malaysia to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. During a search of Nagaenthran and his belongings, the police discovered a bundle strapped to Nagaenthran's thigh, and the bundle contained a total amount of 42.72 g of diamorphine (pure heroin). A friend and travelling partner of Nagaenthran, named Kumarsen, was also arrested but later released. Upon his arrest, Nagaenthran admitted to his interrogators that he knew he was carrying drugs and it was a Chinese friend, whom he called \"King\", who strapped the drugs to his thigh so that no one would find it. Nagaenthran also claimed that he needed money to pay off his debts and his father's heart surgery fees, which was why he committed the crime.Later, Nagaenthran retracted his confession and denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle of drugs found on him. He also later claimed that King had earlier assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend should he not comply with King's demands to transport the drugs. Nevertheless, due to his arrest and the amount of heroin having exceeded the lower limit for the death penalty, 15 g, Nagaenthran was charged with capital drug trafficking, which, if found guilty, is punishable by death.. Nagaenthran was tried and found guilty on 22 November 2010 of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by hanging. The High Court's judge Chan Seng Onn did not accept Nagaenthran's defence that he was under duress at the time he committed the crime, and ruled that Nagaenthran should assume full responsibility of his criminal conduct, since he did so to discharge his debts. His appeal was dismissed on 27 July 2011 by the Court of Appeal's three judges Chan Sek Keong, V. K. Rajah and Andrew Phang. Appeals for re-sentencing. Legal changes and re-sentencing application. A year after Nagaenthran's appeal was dismissed, Singapore decided to amend its death penalty laws in July 2012, which designated a moratorium on all 35 executions in Singapore, including Nagaenthran's. The amendments, which took effect in January 2013, empowered all judges in Singapore with the discretion to sentence a drug trafficker to life imprisonment with caning not less than 15 strokes instead of death if he was merely a courier, on the condition that the public prosecutor issues the offender a certificate of substantive assistance \u2014 for helping the narcotics police to disrupt drug trafficking activities. Another alternative condition to receive life imprisonment was diminished responsibility; had any mental illnesses been diagnosed and found to have substantially impaired one's mental faculties, the offender would have been ineligible for the death sentence and caning would also not be given.When the new death penalty laws took effect in January 2013, Nagaenthran applied for re-sentencing on account of clinical intellectual disability and mental illness, and his case was sent back to the original trial judge Chan Seng Onn for review in the High Court."}]}, "correct": false}

The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy\u2014a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m).

At low tides the water depth was at least 12 feet (3.7 m), thought to be sufficient for most steamers. These piers still stand today, though they have been interconnected.. The architect was Sir Horace Jones, designer of Smithfield Market and Tower Bridge. Since time was short, Jones took a minimalist approach. The site was not cleared: the existing dockyard buildings were preserved and adapted as necessary. The dockyard had a tidal basin surrounded by three ship-building sheds, each as lofty as Charing Cross station (see title image). By connecting these together Jones obtained a cattle lairage building comprising a pentagonal horseshoe with open sides facing the river and the landing piers (see Layout).  To the east another lairage shed had its own pier.  Animals were provided with water troughs and hay racks, and the lairs were brilliantly lighted at night by gas lamps.  There was enough covered accommodation for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep.  Later it was enlarged, and could accommodate 8,500 cattle and 20,000 sheep.  Admiralty storehouses were converted into abattoirs, comprising some 70 slaughterhouses.The demise of the old naval dockyard was regretted by many, and some features dating to Henry VIII were preserved.  By order of the City officials, a board was put up bearing the following inscription: \"Here worked as a ship-carpenter Peter, Czar of all the Russias, afterwards Peter the Great, 1698.\" \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t. \t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t.

Market life. The market was surrounded by a high boundary wall.  Services inside included bank branches, a postal telegraph office, and the market's own pub, the Peter the Great. Trading. It was not an auction market.  Trading was by private bargain, and in live animals only.  Exporters consigned cattle, sheep and pigs to salesmen who worked on commission.  Salesmen and buyers intermingled around the animal pens. Market days were Mondays and Thursdays, but there was nothing to stop animals being sold in their lairs on other days, and this was often done, especially when a shipload arrived late.. Weighbridges were seldom used: it was a matter of professional pride that cattle weights were guesstimated.  A journalist described it for Australian readers:The buyer runs over the lot, say, twenty or fifty, averaging the weights by calculation, and then offers a price, which is of course contemptuously rejected at first. By a gradual process of approximation the difficulty is got over, and a shake of the hand, or other mysterious sign, indicates the purchase of \u00a31000 worth of beef. The buyers were wholesale (and sometimes retail) butchers, who had access to slaughterhouse space on the premises, generally renting it by the year. Slaughtermen, paid by results, killed and butchered their purchases for them within the 10 days required by law; the buyers took away the meat, offal, hides and fleeces: most of the meat they resold at Smithfield.  By the end of 1887 some 9.4 million animals had been landed at Deptford. Statistics. The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.

However, once cold storage was available at ports, chilled meat could be stored for an additional two weeks. Although the live animal trade was also risky, the chilled trade was larger. Some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English or Scottish beef, which was easier to do before compulsory marking of origin was introduced in 1933.

She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.  However, Perren accepted that, once cold-storage was available at ports, chilled meat would keep for another 14 days after arrival; that livestock had to be slaughtered within 10 days of arrival; that the live animal trade was also risky; and that the chilled trade was the bigger of the two.  He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or \u00a34 per head of cattle (\u225d \u00a35002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market's trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that \"foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton\".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

Employment conditions. Employment conditions in Deptford Foreign Cattle Market were investigated by social researcher Charles Booth and are described in his Life and Labour of the People in London (1896).. The market had about 110 direct employees. In addition 1500 casual workers, mostly drovers and slaughtermen, were paid on piecework, and at times could earn high wages, but the hours were irregular and employment was precarious.  They were irregular because they depended on when ships arrived.  It was precarious because the volume of trade was driven by the animal disease regulations, which kept changing.  As was common in high-wage, insecure jobs that attracted improvident men, there was much insobriety, said Booth's researchers.Unemployment at the market might cause severe hardship in Deptford, where it was already high because people migrated to the district to find work. There is a record of market workers sending a wreath to the funeral of George Joseph Cooper MP, admired because at one time Argentina was put on the blacklist and he had tried very hard to get it removed.  In 1924, years after the market had closed, efforts were still being made to get it re-opened. Drovers. It was their job to drive the animals off the boats, or to transship them from the transatlantic steamers at Gravesend.   Nearly all the drovers begin their life in the market as \"ochre boys\", that is, boys who mark the animals with ochre for the butchers, and who are paid a few pence for so doing.  When they get old enough, and begin to pick up the drover's craft, they apply to the City Corporation for a licence, which is granted on satisfactory proof of good character on the payment of a fee of 5s, and is annually renewable without further payment.. Drovers at Deptford market were paid a lump sum per vessel, George Philcox told Booth.  They could unload a cattle boat in as little as 15 minutes. Some cattle, especially from Argentina, were very wild, and were best given \"a wide berth\". A man in regular employment could earn as much as \u00a34 a week (about \u00a3520 purchasing power in 2018 money). Slaughtermen. These men, who killed and butchered the animals, worked in gangs of four, and earned very high wages for the era: \u00a35 (\u2245 \u00a36502018) a week was not uncommon. No slaughtering was done on Saturdays; on other days it varied according to demand, and for a rush order might last up to 20 hours on end.  The work was said to be brutalising \"and conducive to drink\".A carefully aimed blow at the head with a poleaxe was the usual method of stunning used in Britain.  While The Times reported favourably on the relative humanity practised at Deptford, it came from the skill acquired by regular repetition; it was not infallible.  A tanner, examining the lesions on a sample 100 cattle hides \u2014 albeit not from Deptford \u2014 noted that 45% showed signs of more than one blow i.e., they were not stunned by the first stroke.  An advocate of the Jewish shechita method (which was also used at the market) said that he had observed that it often took five blows to fell an ox at Deptford.That women slaughtered animals at Deptford is not supported by reliable sources. Women: the gut girls. One of the most unpleasant jobs was cleaning cattle and sheep intestines, which were used for making sausage skins (and, according to a later source, condoms).  Originally men's work, in about 1891 they went on strike for more pay: management responded by assigning the work to women.. Some 80-100 women and girls, aged 14 to 40, were employed daily; they worked for two firms that had contracted to buy all the gut offal from the market's slaughterhouses.  Writing for the Daily Telegraph, \"A Lady Visitor\", who claimed to have smelled some vile odours in her time, said the stink was insupportable.

The market was designed to accommodate up to three cattle boats at once, with three timber piers and platforms at two levels to facilitate cattle discharge at any tide. The market aimed to serve as a quarantine facility, ensuring that animals were slaughtered within 10 days of arrival and preventing the spread of diseases to the general population.", "text": "Background: London's cattle markets. The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy\u2014a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide."}, {"summary_score": 0.7729689579394415, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7451971240951346, "text_rank": 5, "summary": "The Metropolitan Cattle Market moved to a new location in Islington, called the Foreign Cattle Market, in 1855. This market, built on the Thames' south bank, had a capacity for 5,000 cattle and 14,000 sheep and was used as a quarantine facility to prevent disease spread. By 1880, most imported cattle and sheep were slaughtered here. Slaughtermen, paid based on results, would kill and butcher animals within 10 days, with buyers taking away the meat, offal, hides, and fleeces, often reselling them at Smithfield. By 1907, 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.\n\nThe market, which saw 9.4 million animals by 1887, purchased three paddle steamers to accommodate over 1.6 million animals from cattle boats coming from the Continent.

The volume of trade fluctuated considerably, but from modest beginnings in 1872 it increased until, by about 1890, more (foreign) cattle were sent to Deptford than (British) to Islington.  By 1907, according to the Westminster Gazette 78% of London's live cattle trade went to Deptford.  The largest number of cattle ever landed in one year was 224,831 (1897); of sheep, 783,440 (1882).  Detailed statistics are set out in tables in this note.In the Edwardian era a combination of Chicago meatpackers took advantage of the loophole in the regulations \u2014 that animals need not be put up for sale on market days \u2014 to bypass the marketing system altogether.  See The Beef Trust, below.. Altogether 16.5 million animals were slaughtered at Deptford. Cattle boats. Cattle boats from the Continent \u2014 over a thousand a year \u2014 came up the Thames on Sundays and Wednesdays.As the transatlantic cattle trade developed (see below), large ocean-going cattle steamers came into use, but these were reluctant to come alongside.  Accordingly the market purchased three paddle steamers (named Racoon, Taurus and Claude Hamilton) into which cattle were transshipped at Gravesend.  Between them, those vessels conveyed more than 1.6 million animals to Deptford. Jack the Ripper, Deptford cattle boat man. One of the many theories about Jack the Ripper was that he was a Portuguese cattle attendant on a boat from Porto.  When it docked at Deptford, a Whitechapel murder ensued, or so insisted a customs official who claimed to see a statistical correlation.  His persistence irritated the police, but his theory was noticed by Queen Victoria.  \"The Queen fears the Detective Department is not as efficient as it might be...  Have the cattle boats & passenger boats been examined?\" Veterinary. On landing, animals were examined by a veterinary surgeon who took their pulse and temperature.  Suspects were set aside for observation.  If one animal in a cargo was found to be contagious, it was slaughtered at once and its carcase sterilised by steam in an iron digester; its companions were put with the suspects.  Drovers wore protective clothing, afterwards disinfected in a sulphur chamber.  Hides, horns, fleeces and offal were also disinfected; manure and litter were sterilised.  A correspondent from The Times thought the market was very clean and by the standards of the day animals were slaughtered humanely.Foreign veterinarians observed for their governments.  American cattle bore ear tags and, if one was found to be diseased, the American vet would telegraph the serial number to his government: the animal's home farm could be traced within hours and a quarantine imposed if necessary.  The Argentine government sent a vet too, in 1903.The quarantine rules could minimise, but could not altogether prevent, the importation of contagious diseases.  The government accepted that cattle plague (1877) and foot-and-mouth disease (1880 and 1882) had escaped from Deptford market.Besides cattle, sheep and pigs, there was a small trade in horses and donkeys.  The rule that no animal could leave the market alive was strictly enforced.  A country bumpkin from Essex brought a complaint before magistrate Montagu Williams.  The Essex man, needing a good steed, had been induced by a glowing advertisement to pay \u00a330 for a horse, viewable at Deptford Market.  He did not realise it was in no condition to be ridden away. George Philcox.

Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.  Progressive Argentine cattlemen were keenly aware that quality was important, and they paid large prices for Shorthorn bulls to improve their herds.   Such was the demand for export-grade cattle in 1903 that an American agent told his government \"it is extremely difficult to get a good piece of beef in the city of Buenos Aires\".  \"Wild, untamed brutes\" did badly on the sea journey, and had to be tamed in advance and taught to eat hay.Deptford was closed to Argentine cattle and sheep in 1900 for foot-and-mouth, and briefly re-opened in 1903.

Next year there was a much more successful voyage by Port Pirie: one animal died of heat in the Red Sea, but the others arrived in excellent condition (see illustration).  Another success was 250 sheep per Banffshire from Dunedin; only one was lost.. However, as shipments continued there were \"terrible\" losses.  For these ambitious voyages more than halfway round the world, excellent planning and execution were essential, but were wanting. The Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, clapped an extinguisher on the trade. The vessel left the port on November 22, 1895, and arrived at Deptford on February 9, 1896, with 32 animals [alive], some of which were in a maimed condition. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took the matter up, and the Board of Agriculture inspected the ship and issued an order prohibiting the Angers from carrying live stock from or to any port in Great Britain for a twelvemonth..

The end of Smithfield as a livestock market. For centuries the main cattle market for London had been held at Smithfield. There being no refrigeration, butchers bought an animal at the market, and slaughtered it themselves.  The site was small and by the Victorian era the volume of trade had increased to the point that it was badly overcrowded and a public health nuisance.  Driving cattle to Smithfield through the thoroughfares of the metropolis e.g. Oxford Street was bad for traffic congestion and endangered life and limb.Hence in 1855 Parliament moved London's livestock market to a site in Islington.  Later, Smithfield was rebuilt as a dead meat market: the one that stands today. The Metropolitan Cattle Market. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was in Copenhagen Fields, Islington.. A growing population and increasing money wages created a demand for more meat. The British farming industry, protected from competition, could not satisfy the demand. In 1842-6 the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel\u2014as in its repeal of the Corn Laws\u2014had legislated to allow all foreign cattle to be imported duty free. It was the beginning of the free trade era (\"the first globalisation\").. By railway the Metropolitan Cattle Market received livestock not only from most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but increasingly from the Continent.  John Gamgee, a veterinary scientist, warned that free trade in animals was dangerous because it would import diseases\u2014had already done so.  But the commercial interests were too powerful, and the trade continued.As European rail links improved, these cattle came from as far away as the plains of Hungary and, eventually, Russia. That country had never been free from cattle plague (rinderpest), an infectious disease highly mortal to immunologically na\u00efve cattle. It got into the Metropolitan Cattle Market and rapidly spread to most parts of Great Britain. The 1865 cattle plague: need for a second, quarantine market. The cattle plague epidemic of 1865-7 has been described as the most dramatic event in 19th century agricultural history.  Believing it to be a divine retribution for the sins of society, the Archbishop of Canterbury demanded a day of national humiliation.Little was known about rinderpest in Great Britain and it took two years to eradicate.  It did not help that the germ theory of disease had yet to be established. Quarantines and the mass slaughter of infected herds led to agitation against the foreign cattle trade.. Wrote Charles Dickens:All the evidence points to one short, simple, certain, severe and somewhat costly remedy\u2014a market exclusively reserved for foreign fat cattle at every port of debarkation, where every animal intended for the butcher should be slain, after sale, in abbatoirs provided for the purpose. . New laws followed.  They encouraged the City of London to open and run a second metropolitan livestock market exclusively for imported animals, to be known as the Foreign Cattle Market.  It was appreciated that, not only rinderpest, but pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease were contagious threats.Unless convinced that a foreign country was disease-free, the Privy Council (later, the Board of Agriculture) was authorised to \"schedule\" it, which meant put it on a greylist.  Animals from that country, while not banned outright, must be landed at this new market, and nowhere else.   It was to operate under quarantine conditions, and no animal was to leave it alive, but had to be slaughtered within 10 days. The Foreign Cattle Market: location, design and opening. Since the new market must be in a port, a suitable site on the Thames had to be chosen.  There was lobbying for the market to be on the river's north bank, since many traders, especially the butchers of Whitechapel, did not want to have to travel to south London to buy their meat; but there were few adequate sites and access to these was poor. Eventually the defunct royal dockyard at Deptford was chosen.  Here in times past Elizabeth I had come to knight Francis Drake aboard the Golden Hind, and Peter the Great of Russia had studied shipbuilding.The Deptford site comprised 22 acres (8.9 ha) (afterwards increased to 30 acres (12 ha), bigger than Les Halles in Paris) and had a river frontage of 1,012 feet (308 m). It was situated on a bend in the Thames, at the bottom of Limehouse Reach. It was designed to receive up to three cattle boats at once, which might conceivably arrive at any time, day or night. Hence three large, immensely strong, timber piers were constructed for disembarking cattle. Piers were provided with platforms at two levels, so that animals could be discharged no matter what the state of the tide."}]}, "correct": false}

Although most European animals came from Rotterdam and Hamburg, they were part of a larger network of railways extending into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia. The Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, with some shipments arriving directly from the port of Kronstadt, Russia.\n\nThe European livestock trade gradually declined by the late 1880s due to disease endemic in places like Prussia, where cattle smuggling was prevalent. The United States became the main supplier, with 3,144,400 American cattle landed at Deptford by 1913. American livestock exports to England were driven by a surplus that could not be absorbed by local demand.\n\nThe American West provided the surplus, with early Western cattle like Texas longhorns being replaced by higher-quality breeds through crossbreeding with Shorthorn and Hereford blood. This upgrading was a response to the demand for better cattle in the English export trade. By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. The transportation of a 1,200-pound steer from the western U.S. to Deptford market cost only 4d a pound, including all charges. The improvement in the quality of American cattle was mainly due to the introduction of the Hereford bull, which led to better beef and overall improvement in the industry.", "text": "Forrest Capie and Richard Perren said that, although most European animals were shipped from Rotterdam and Hamburg, these towns were [just] the terminal stations of a great network of main German railway lines and branch lines that ran into Hungary, Poland, and Galicia and extended right up to Bessarabian frontier. In the 1860s the Dutch ports alone sent 150,000 cattle and 250,000 sheep to Britain, many of which passed through the markets of Austria and several German principalities before they reached their port of embarkation. . Several Deptford shipments arrived directly from the port of Kronstadt, in Russia, and were known to have been purchased in the cattle market of Saint Petersburg.  The Russian capital was more than 30\u00b0 to the east of Deptford, and these animals may have come from much further still, since Saint Petersburg oblast raised few export-grade cattle.  They may have been driven to market from south Russia.  In 1872 the Russian Empire was blacklisted for cattle plague and no more Russian cattle could be landed, even at Deptford. Demise of European cattle trade. The European livestock trade was gradually stopped by the late 1880s \u2014 except for Iceland \u2014 after the British authorities faced the fact that too much livestock was really coming from places where disease was endemic \"and the provincial authorities made no attempt to stamp it out\". For example Prussia had stringent laws against animal disease but \"the profits from smuggling cattle from Poland are too enticing.By then the United States had become the main supplier. From the United States. Of all the cattle ever landed at Deptford market, the largest proportion came from the U.S.A.  The practice started in 1878 when American cattle and pigs were \"scheduled\" for port slaughter. By 1913, when Deptford had closed, 3,144,400 American cattle had been landed there, besides sheep and pigs.Nearly all American livestock exports went to England. Americans sent livestock to England because they had a surplus that could not be absorbed by local demand.  When, eventually, it was, which happened by 1913, exportation ceased.  Writing in 1915, two senior American officials said: \"Our beef surplus has vanished and our own people now require all that our farms and ranches produce\". Upgrading livestock in the American West. The surplus came from the new, teeming lands of the American West.  But early Western cattle e.g. Texas longhorns, though hardy, made tough eating.  It cost exactly the same to ship a top quality steer from New York to London as a gristly one.  Consequently, it made economic sense for American shippers to export their best animals, as better able to absorb the cost of carriage. At first, export-grade cattle were to be found in the East only, where cattle breeds were similar to those of the British Isles.  British farmers were advised not to worry about imported Western livestock for the present, because it would not compete on quality.  But (as predicted) Western cattlemen realised they could capture lucrative markets by improving their stock \u2014 and did so.  The English export trade contributed to the demand for more and better cattle.Stockmen found profitable the exportation of only the choicest grade cattle and attained this quality by upgrading the range-stock with Shorthorn and Hereford blood...  The trade therefore became a factor in improving the quality of American cattle.   Progressive American cattlemen imported prize British bulls, sometimes paying fabulous prices.  \"On the western plains the ranches that succeeded the open range bought high priced sires with which to upgrade their old stock. The upturn in the quality of beef animals, with younger cattle going to the feedlot, meant better beef from the slaughter house and on the family table, all part of a general improvement\". It was the Hereford bull, more than any other single factor, that increased the size and quality of range cattle. . Comparable improvements were made in sheep.  By 1884, 95% of cattle exported came from the West. Distances. Already in 1880 The Times was advising its readers that a 1,200 pounds (540 kg) steer from (say) Colorado, Wyoming or Montana could be conveyed to Deptford market \u2014 over 2,000 miles of land and 3,000 of ocean \u2014 for \u00a310 or \u00a312. It included cowboys' wages, rail fare, shipping freight and the landing charges at Deptford (which, thought the author, were rather extortionate).  All this added only 4d a pound to the carcase price of beef (\u2245\u00a34.40 a kilo2018).Scientific American reported that, recently, five cattle-laden steamers had sailed from New York to England in one day."}]}, "correct": false}

An inquiry in 1909 confirmed these practices but found that the Trust could not fix the price of beef due to declining American exports and increasing Argentine refrigerated beef shipments. Animal welfare was a concern during these long journeys.", "text": "From Argentina. As the North American surplus dwindled, Deptford's main supply of animals came from Argentina.  Formerly, Argentine cattle \"were of an inferior breed, their chief characteristics being thick hides and well-developed horns\"; they were slaughtered locally for their hides, bones and tallow. Two things transformed the Argentine beef industry into the greatest exporter in the world: selective breeding and alfalfa (lucerne) forage.From about 1888 live cattle and sheep were shipped as deck cargo from Buenos Aires, carpenters knocking up temporary stalls and pens.  Animals were brought to Buenos Aires e.g. 450 to 750 miles by rail and hoisted aboard vessels by steam crane.  The voyage to London took about 30 days.  Progressive Argentine cattlemen were keenly aware that quality was important, and they paid large prices for Shorthorn bulls to improve their herds.   Such was the demand for export-grade cattle in 1903 that an American agent told his government \"it is extremely difficult to get a good piece of beef in the city of Buenos Aires\".  \"Wild, untamed brutes\" did badly on the sea journey, and had to be tamed in advance and taught to eat hay.Deptford was closed to Argentine cattle and sheep in 1900 for foot-and-mouth, and briefly re-opened in 1903.  Thereafter there was scant incentive to revive the live meat trade on these very long journeys.  From about 1900 good chilled Argentine beef was a more satisfactory alternative. Severe unemployment came to Deptford. From Australia and New Zealand. At the end of the Victorian era cattle and sheep were shipped to Deptford Market from as far away as Victoria (Australia), New South Wales, Queensland, and Dunedin, New Zealand.. The first commercial (though experimental) shipment was from Sydney on the steamer Maori King, a 67-day voyage which went around Cape Horn in winter \u2014 presumably to avoid the heat of the Suez Canal.  The cattle landed at Deptford in September 1894, but sold at a heavy loss.  Next year there was a much more successful voyage by Port Pirie: one animal died of heat in the Red Sea, but the others arrived in excellent condition (see illustration).  Another success was 250 sheep per Banffshire from Dunedin; only one was lost.. However, as shipments continued there were \"terrible\" losses.  For these ambitious voyages more than halfway round the world, excellent planning and execution were essential, but were wanting. The Angers shipment of 381 cattle from Gladstone, Queensland, clapped an extinguisher on the trade. The vessel left the port on November 22, 1895, and arrived at Deptford on February 9, 1896, with 32 animals [alive], some of which were in a maimed condition. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took the matter up, and the Board of Agriculture inspected the ship and issued an order prohibiting the Angers from carrying live stock from or to any port in Great Britain for a twelvemonth.. Altogether in the Australasian live trade, 607 cattle were lost out of 2,654 shipped, and 57 out of 3,882 sheep. The Beef Trust. The Beef Trust was a cartel of the large Chicago meat packers.  Acting in collusion they allocated market shares and fixed meat prices in the United States, eventually coming under attack by \"trust buster\" president Theodore Roosevelt.  As described in the next section, by 1900 the Beef Trust controlled the business of shipping live cattle to England from America.. In the Edwardian era reputable newspapers claimed that  the Trust had bought up many shops in Smithfield Market;. they met every morning to fix the price of British beef;. they practically controlled the lairages at Deptford Market; but. instead of selling their Deptford cattle to buyers at that market, they sent the meat directly to Smithfield; with the result that, on a numerous occasions, market days at Deptford were cancelled for lack of support.As a result of persistent questioning by C. W. Bowerman, Labour MP for Deptford, Winston Churchill (the President of the Board of Trade) set up an inquiry into \"how far and in what manner the general supply, distribution and price of Meat in the United Kingdom are controlled or affected by any combination of firms or companies\".  The inquiry reported in 1909.  The allegations were generally true, except that the Trust was not powerful enough to fix the price of beef in the United Kingdom.  This was because, although it did indeed control the North Atlantic meat trade, American beef exports had declined, and large shipments of refrigerated beef were coming from Argentina.

He highlighted the instability of cattle ships during storms, the cruel treatment of animals, and the unnecessary risks taken by captains. Plimsoll also criticized the poor conditions on board, such as the buildup of animal waste and the use of cruel methods to force animals to stand. Although Plimsoll's campaign was unsuccessful in ending the trade, it did lead to some improvements in British and American regulations. The export trade was dominated by the Beef Trust, a cartel of large American meat packers, who established a liner system to ensure the timely and safe transport of livestock across the Atlantic. Despite these efforts, conditions on board the ships remained harsh, with animals often suffering from injuries and stress during the long journey. The cattle were transported to market by train, often making lengthy journeys to Chicago and then to ports on the eastern seaboard for shipment to England. The US had regulations in place to limit the amount of time animals could travel without a break, but it is unclear if these regulations were always followed.", "text": "He said it ought to be abolished.  In Cattle Ships he seized the reader's attention thus: The Erin sailed from New York in December, 1889, with 527 cattle on board, for London, and has . never since been heard of; she had 74 men on board.. Plimsoll wrote that cattle ships were dangerously unstable in stormy weather, cruel to animals, and unnecessary.  They were unstable if cattle were carried on the upper deck or (worse) on a temporary, higher platform that raised the ship's centre of gravity even further, and obstructed the crew in their duties.  Animals were washed overboard by heavy seas, or were deliberately jettisoned to save the vessel.  If carried down in the holds they could stifle to death after the hatches were battened down in bad weather.  Knowing this, captains sometimes took risks in leaving the hatches open.  Further, animals stood on their own dung, which could not be cleared away; on this slippery surface they fell about helplessly and were injured, often fatally.Plimsoll alleged that cattle attendants were not allowed to euthanise badly injured livestock, because the insurance companies would refuse to pay up.  Animals were left to die a lingering death.  Plimsoll was probably wrong about the insurance companies; but it made no difference, because the cattle attendants thought it was so and behaved accordingly.Another accusation was that cattle attendants used cruel methods to make animals get on their feet, such as piercing them with pitchforks, twisting their tails, beating them about the head with iron buckets, or pouring paraffin in their ears. \"Some of the men in charge, who are paid a percentage on the number of cattle they bring alive into Deptford, tortured the animals most fiendishly into a semblance of animation\".  It was indignantly denied by cattle shippers, who asked what they had to gain by such practices: cattle were free to lie down if they wanted to.  \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t. \t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t\t. \t\t. The cattle attendants included foremen known as \"cowboys of the seas\", \"big burly fellows who are used to rough living and facing danger\"; also a despised class called \"stiffs\" who did the work for little or no pay just to get across the Atlantic.  Sometimes educated men e.g. Harvard students travelled as stiffs.  The poet W.H. Davies was a stiff and wrote about the harsh methods used to make the cattle stand up; so did an English solicitor returning from a working holiday to Canada.  It was done to stop animals tangling their head ropes, or being trampled to death by their fellows. Improvements. A government inquiry tended to confirm many of Plimsoll's allegations.  Although he did not succeed in abolishing the trade, British and American regulations prohibited some of the worst practices.When the export trade became well organised it was dominated by four American meat packers: Swift, Armour, Hammond and Morris: members of the \"Beef Trust\".  They were not shipowners, but they established a liner system.  (A liner is a ship that sails to a schedule; a tramp, when she has a cargo.)  It was essential to organise a regular liner trade because cattle transportation required close coordination, regularity and long-term contractual relationships.  For example, to make sure of shipping space it had to be bought in advance without knowing if London spot meat prices were going to make it worthwhile.  It was to the business advantage of shippers (hence, liners) that livestock arrive in the Thames on time and in excellent condition.  By 1892 North Atlantic animal losses were reduced to less than 1%, ten times better than on the Buenos Aires run.. Even in the good liners, however, the dung and urine were left to accumulate in the holds; the ammoniacal stench was said to be unbearable.  According to Scientific AmericanCattle on deck often have the seawater which comes on board frozen on their backs, and heavy rolls and pitches cause many broken legs. The average run from New York to the Thames was 11 days.  Cattle could scent land, sometimes setting up \"a united bellow\"  when thirty or forty hours from shore. Cattle trains. From the livestock-raising regions animals were taken to market by train, mostly to Chicago. onto which 17 railroads converged.  At the Chicago stockyards there was a special market for \"export grade\" cattle; these were railed to ports on the eastern seaboard for shipment to England.  The map also shows the Canadian Pacific Railway that took livestock from the foothills of the Rocky mountains to Montreal. Lengthy journeys.

The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner said the method of exporting western range cattle was \"sinfully wasteful, unbusinesslike and unprofitable to the producer\", so that Canadian cattle arrived in Britain \"gaunt and shrunken\". Whether economic justification for live cattle trade. Plimsoll's case. Samuel Plimsoll argued that the transatlantic cattle trade had no rational commercial purpose except to enrich dishonest traders.  He asked:Why are live cattle imported at all, when their beef can be more cheaply and easily imported, and in better condition? And he answered:By sending the animals alive the middlemen (sometimes English, sometimes American) who consign the cattle to salesmen, can add to their legitimate profit a wholly illegitimate one, which belongs by right to the English grazier, by calling it, or stating it to be, that which it is not \u2014 namely \"best Scotch\", \"town-killed\", or \"English-fed\" beef. This they could not do if it were imported dead. Was Plimsoll right?. An alternative to the live cattle trade. An alternative to the live cattle trade was American chilled meat.  Already imported into London in 1875, before the Foreign Cattle Market was doing much business, it was a commercial success. It was much cheaper to send meat across the Atlantic chilled than on the hoof; it required refrigerating plant, but it took up less space and only the edible parts were shipped. Imported dead vs. alive. Further, butchers could easily tell that wholesale meat was American if it was imported dead, but not if imported alive.  Meat slaughtered in America was cut (\"dressed\") according to American butchering practices, which were visibly different.  Also, the chilling process slightly discoloured the product.  In contrast, American meat killed at Deptford was dressed by British butchers, hence looked the same as British-fed beef. Why the price premium?. At Smithfield Market a wholesale quantity of Deptford-killed American beef sold for 10-15% more than the same weight of American chilled beef.  Was this because it was thought to be better; or was it because it could be resold fraudulently \u2014 as Scotch or English beef?  That was the question debated in the Victorian era.  The British farming industry had no doubt: the butchers were cheating.  The butchers riposted that the farmers were just trying to protect themselves against competition: customers were not really bothered and rarely asked if a joint was English or foreign.As for palatability, Plimsoll argued that chilled meat (not be confused with frozen meat, an inferior product) was as good as, indeed was better than Deptford-killed beef.  It was better because chilling and keeping were equivalent to well-hung meat.  Cattle slaughtered at Deptford were tired, stressed and bruised from the journey.. What Victorian and Edwardian consumers really thought of chilled beef is difficult to tell: taste, prejudice and snobbery came into it. A writer to The Times said:I know a family in this town of good position who after much anxious thought and weighing all the chances of being poisoned, &c, timorously resolved one day to try this American beef. Unfortunately, the servants heard of the great experiment. The joint, a fine one, was duly served; the family ate and liked it... But, would you believe it, Sir, not one of the four servants would touch it!  By the Edwardian era two authors said \"the West-End folk are very large customers for chilled beef of the highest quality\", which suggests it could be quite palatable.  However that may be, Plimsoll argued it was up to the customer to decide.  She might be prejudiced, but if she was willing to pay more for British-grown beef, she was entitled to get the real thing. Another theory. Richard Perren of Aberdeen University in an 1971 essay argued that the live meat trade survived because the chilled meat trade was riskier. A consignment, having arrived at the London docks, would not keep much longer and had to be sold at Smithfield promptly \u2014 even if the market was glutted.  There was less urgency about disposing of the live beasts.

However, once cold storage was available at ports, chilled meat could be stored for an additional two weeks. Although the live animal trade was also risky, the chilled trade was larger.

He also acknowledged that some butchers fraudulently sold Deptford-killed meat as English, the price being higher. Incentives to fraud. If fraud there was, it was easy to perpetrate: truly effective compulsory marking of origin was not introduced until 1933.  It seems no prosecutions were attempted, and it could be argued the City of London itself encouraged the practice.. Plimsoll calculated that the fraud was worth a penny the pound of meat, or \u00a34 per head of cattle (\u225d \u00a35002018).  A 2010 study found that For all grades of beef, substantial incentives existed to misrepresent American beef as Scottish/English, but the gains declined as time went by, and had ceased to exist by 1911.  By then, Deptford Market's trade was fading away. Examples. In the Victorian era it was reported that \"foreign merino sheep are slaughtered at Deptford, sent to Cardiff, the hind quarters there cut off, sent to London again, and there sold as Welsh mutton\".  It is corroborated by reliable sources.. Scientific American said (1904):The strong and abiding prejudice of the Englishman against either frozen or chilled meat, or imported meat of any sort if he knows it to be imported, can be overcome in only one way. Instead of carcasses chilled or frozen being brought, the live cattle are conveyed to an English port and at once taken ashore and slaughtered... even an expert would find it hard to tell the difference. . A writer for a Chicago livestock magazine in 1912 tried and failed to find any American meat for sale at Smithfield, though he knew hundreds of American cattle had recently been butchered at Deptford.  At last a stallholder admitted their meat was being sold as English.An English port medical officer, generally sympathetic to the live cattle trade, remarked on the disparity between port-killed wholesale prices and butchers' retail prices. Unexpected benefit. Paradoxically, the transatlantic cattle trade made for cheaper bread.  The reason was spotted by economic historian Knick Harley.. Vessels laden with cattle were too buoyant, and needed to be ballasted.  An easy way to do it was to fill their deep holds with American grain.  On some routes it was carried free \u2014 it was cheaper than buying ballast.  Thus, inexpensive and abundant American wheat was conveyed to England for very low rates.  Effectively, the beef eaters were subsidising the bread eaters. The end of the Foreign Cattle Market. With the 1903 embargo on Argentine cattle, and diminishing American and Canadian supplies, the market went into a decline.  In 1912 George Philcox died, borne to the grave by market employees: the City Press wrote that it was of a broken heart, caused by the decay of the market to which he had devoted his life.  In 1913 the City of London decided to close it down.At the outbreak of World War I the site was occupied by the War Office.  It became a supply base, sending rations to the troops in France.  After the War the City sold it to the government.  In time the site became known as Convoys Wharf.Some remains of the old Market (and former dockyard), such as boundary walls, were made listed buildings, and stand today.  General. Alsford, Niki J.P.

Youngkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average. Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennual education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually. The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state's achievement gaps.In contrast to McAuliffe, who introduced much of his education platform concurrently with his announcement to run in the Democratic primary, Youngkin did not begin sharing proposals for state spending on education until months after securing the Republican nomination. McAuliffe criticized Youngkin for not releasing budget details until late in the campaign and argued that spending on education in Virginia could be threatened by the extent of Youngkin's tax cut proposals. The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin's education platform was \"far lighter on details\" than McAuliffe's and that it largely focused on cultural issues over budgetary proposals. Youngkin began offering specific proposals for education spending late in the summer of 2021, only a few months before the election. These proposals included $100 million a year for raising teacher salaries, $200 million for improvements to school infrastructure, and over $1 billion for expanding school choice programs.Youngkin inherited a record surplus in state revenue from Northam, which was projected to continue growing during the state's then-upcoming budget cycle. As a result of this surplus, Youngkin had the opportunity to sign a biennial state budget in 2022 that committed $19.2 billion to education, a record for the state even when accounting for inflation. This exceeded the $16.95 billion in education spending that Republicans had wanted to include in the biennial budget. Republicans agreed to the higher amount as part of a budget compromise with Democrats. In exchange for getting much of their desired education spending enacted, Democrats agreed to enact several of Youngkin's tax cut proposals.Incorporated into the budget compromise was an outgoing proposal of Northam's to enact a 10% salary increase for Virginia teachers over two years. Also included in the compromise were one-time $1,000 bonuses for teachers. This plan was chosen over the one preferred by Republicans, which would have paired a more modest 8% salary increase for teachers over two years with 1% bonuses.School construction and maintenance received $1.25 billion in the 2022 biennial state budget. This exceeds the amount that had been allotted for these needs in Northam's outgoing budget proposals but is a small fraction of the $25 billion that the Virginia Department of Education says it would take to fully replace the state's oldest schools.The Virginia Preschool Initiative was expanded by the 2022 biennial state budget. This program provides preschool for many low-income children in the state. Prior to 2022, the program only served children aged four or older, and only families earning less than the federal poverty line could qualify."}, {"summary_score": 0.8715066012579552, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8679206505026054, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "Post-election, Youngkin prioritized nuclear energy and eased regulations on single-use plastics and permitting processes, favoring business groups over environmental and health care advocates. He vetoed bipartisan-backed bills, including a medical debt collection statute of limitations and a tobacco use premium ban, despite national studies indicating cost reduction. An amendment reallocated financial aid from undocumented immigrants to historically black colleges, drawing criticism for pitting disadvantaged groups against each other. Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage but maintains he won't interfere, though his actions have sparked controversy among LGBTQ+ groups. He also expressed reluctance regarding potential Supreme Court actions on same-sex marriage. Youngkin proposed re-criminalizing marijuana possession over two ounces, contrasting with the previous administration's decriminalization approach.", "text": "VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental groups. Health care. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use. Both bills had passed the state legislature with broad bipartisan support. Youngkin explained his veto of the latter bill by claiming that such a policy would have caused higher costs for consumers. According to The Washington Post, this claim conflicted with national studies showing that the policy would have decreased costs for consumers. The publication also noted that Youngkin's veto of that bill was in opposition to \"the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan study commission\". Immigration. An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget took $10 million over two years that had been planned as financial aid for undocumented immigrants pursuing higher education in Virginia and used the money instead to increase financial aid for students attending Virginia's historically black colleges and universities. The amendment was passed by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. According to The Washington Post, half of the money reallocated by the amendment will be \"used to supplement in-state student aid at Norfolk State and Virginia State universities, which are both public institutions\" and the other half will be used to \"increase Virginia Tuition Assistance Grants, a form of aid for residents attending private colleges and universities, to $7,500 from $5,000 a year for students enrolled in historically Black institutions.\" Lamont Bagby, chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, condemned the amendment, calling it the wrong way to help HBCUs. Several Democrats characterized the amendment as an effort to \"pit\" two different disadvantaged student groups against each other. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Youngkin could have drawn from \"up to $50 million in unappropriated money\" in state revenue to assist Virginia's HBCUs, rather than taking money that had been initially allocated to assist undocumented immigrant students. LGBTQ rights. Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage, but has said he would not interfere with the issue as governor. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said that he considers same-sex marriage \"legally acceptable\" and that \"as governor, [he] would support [legal same-sex marriage].\" He has maintained the governor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Board but has been criticized by members of that board for what they have described as his lack of meaningful support for the LGBTQ+ community.In June 2022, Youngkin expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month; he hosted \"a private Pride reception at the Capitol\" but did not invite any of Virginia's openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. Those who boycotted the event did so because they saw it as inconsistent with Youngkin's policy stances, which they considered to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. That same month, Youngkin hosted the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ+ Republican group, at the Governor's Mansion. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which wrote that Youngkin's choice to celebrate Pride Month \"dismays many people of faith\".In July 2022, shortly after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if that court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can't live in the world of hypotheticals.\" The Virginia Constitution includes an amendment banning same-sex marriage, which, according to Washington Post, \"would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself.\" An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office. Marijuana. A few months after his inauguration, Youngkin proposed that Virginia recriminalize possessing more than two ounces of marijuana. When the Northam administration, a year earlier, had legalized possessing up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia, it did so while establishing a system in which possessing between one ounce and one pound was made punishable by a $25 fine; possessing over one pound remained a felony. This system made Virginia the only US state to have legalized marijuana possession without having misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount."}]}, "correct": false}

During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\" Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\".The tipline was described by The Washington Post as \"part of a broader push by Youngkin to identify and root out what he says are elements of critical race theory in the state\u2019s curriculum.\" The publication further reported that the tipline was viewed by \"a teachers union, Democrats in the General Assembly, some parents and other observers...as divisive, authoritarian and unfairly targeting educators.\" Virginia Republicans have defended the tipline by comparing it to systems that previous governors of the state had set up for people to report violations of business regulations and health protocols. On January 26, a spokesperson for Youngkin tweeted that critics of the tipline had mischaracterized it and described the tipline as \"a customary constituent service.\"A week after the tipline debuted, CNN reported that the initiative had drawn national attention. Colin Jost derided the tipline on Saturday Night Live during Weekend Update, and John Legend encouraged opponents of the initiative to co-opt the tipline, tweeting, \"Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced. We are parents too.\" Several media outlets reported that critics of Youngkin were spamming the tipline. Describing it as a \"snitch line\", political scientist Larry Sabato predicted that the tipline would \"backfire\" on Youngkin. Near the end of January, WSET reported that the tipline had been criticized by \"Virginia teachers and the Virginia Education Association...for targeting teachers who are already struggling amid staffing shortages and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic\", while The Lead with Jake Tapper reported that the tipline could cause retention problems among Virginia educators.On February 3, 2022, Youngkin explained that his administration was \"responding\" to complaints submitted to the tipline but did not say whether there would be ramifications for teachers mentioned in those complaints. That month, it was reported that multiple inquiries by The Virginian-Pilot about how complaints sent to the tipline would be used by the Youngkin administration had gone unanswered and that FOIA requests to see emails sent to the tipline had been denied by the Youngkin administration, citing the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption in Virginia's FOIA law. In April, a group of over a dozen media outlets sued the Youngkin administration for access to the emails. The lawsuit argued that the \"working papers and correspondence\" exemption did not apply in this instance, because access to the emails had not been restricted solely to Youngkin's office (Youngkin had allowed a conservative think tank to access the emails). In August, a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, and a law firm, Ballard Spahr, joined together in bringing a second lawsuit against the Youngkin administration, seeking access to the emails. In November, the first lawsuit concluded with a settlement that granted the media outlets access to 350 of the emails, representing a small portion of the total number. Shortly after the settlement was reached, the Youngkin administration revealed that it had closed down the tipline in September. The Washington Post reported that the administration had \"quietly pulled the plug on the tipline...as tips dried up\". The second lawsuit is still ongoing. Loudoun County School Board proposal. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members. A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at \"holding [the board] to account\" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier.

Youngkin also repealed protections for transgender students, replacing them with policies that require student-access to school facilities and programs to be determined by biological sex and mandate the use of legal documentation for name or gender changes.

Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign. In response to Youngkin's proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office. The Washington Post reported that Youngkin's effort had \"stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.\" The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the \"more controversial actions\" that Youngkin had taken and led to \"one of the harshest partisan eruptions\" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin's term. Legal scholar A.E. Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia's Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s. The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Repeal of protections for transgender students. In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing protections for transgender students in Virginia schools. These protections had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. That bill requires that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with \"model policies\" developed by the Virginia Department of Education. Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes. The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student. Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin's policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students. It has been suggested that Youngkin's policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot \"encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student\u2019s parent, including information related to gender.\"The Youngkin administration framed its replacement of the Northam administration's policies as part of a \"commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students.\" The Washington Post noted that Youngkin's actions fit into a national trend among Republicans, writing that \"at least 300 pieces of legislation\" curtailing the rights of transgender Americans had been introduced throughout the country in 2022, mostly focusing on children. Despite the legal requirement that they do so, most Virginia school districts had failed to adopt the Northam administration's model policies by the time that the Youngkin administration's replacement policies were announced. Other school districts have refused to adopt the Youngkin administration's model policies, expressing the view that these policies are in violation of state law.Youngkin's actions are expected to face court challenges. Although the 2020 bill signed by Northam did not specify what Virginia's model policies for the treatment of transgender students should be, it stated that the policies should \"address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices\" and that the policies should protect transgender students from bullying and harassment. Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that Youngkin's model policies fail to meet this criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law."}]}, "correct": true}

The budget included an increase in the standard deduction for personal income tax, one-time tax rebates, and a partial elimination of Virginia's grocery tax. However, Democrats blocked Youngkin's proposal to eliminate a local grocery tax and his goal of offering gas tax relief. The budget also featured a military pension tax exemption and a refundable earned income tax credit, the latter being a longtime Democratic priority. Youngkin's campaign economic advisor, Stephen Moore, had previously helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas, which were criticized for leading to spending cuts in education and transportation. The budget's centerpiece was the increased standard deduction, while other aspects aligned with Northam's outgoing budget proposals.", "text": "\"In late August 2021, Youngkin announced a series of more modest tax cut proposals. These included eliminating the grocery tax, suspending the gas tax increase, offering a one-time rebate on income tax, doubling the standard deduction on income tax, cutting the retirement tax on veterans' income, implementing voter approval for any increase to local real estate property taxes, and offering a tax holiday for small businesses. Upon their announcement, the Associated Press called these proposals \"the most wide-ranging and detailed look at the priorities of a potential Youngkin administration\". Had these proposals gone on to be enacted in full, they would have amounted to $1.8 billion in one-time tax cuts and $1.4 billion in recurring tax cuts. During the campaign, Youngkin proposed paying for much of his proposed tax cuts with the state's budget surplus, which at the time, was projected to total $2.6 billion. Although The Washington Post and NPR both noted that much of that revenue would be unavailable for tax cuts, since state law required that over half of the amount be devoted to the state's \"rainy day\" reserve fund, water quality improvement fund, and transportation fund, Virginia's budget surplus continued to grow, and by the end of Northam's term, was projected to total at least $13.4 billion for the state's then-upcoming budget cycle.As his campaign's senior economic advisor, Youngkin hired Stephen Moore, who had helped oversee significant tax cuts in Kansas several years earlier when Sam Brownback was in office as that state's governor. NPR noted towards the end of the Virginia gubernatorial campaign that Youngkin \"sourced much of his fiscal agenda from [Moore].\" In response to Moore's hiring, The Washington Post described the Brownback tax cuts as \"an experiment widely seen as a failure, leading the state to slash spending for priorities such as education and transportation when revenue dried up\". The publication noted that the tax cuts were ultimately repealed \"on a bipartisan vote\". Youngkin's Democratic gubernatorial opponent, Terry McAuliffe, cited the economic downturn in Kansas as a way to critique Youngkin's economic platform. Moore acknowledged after joining the Youngkin campaign that the Brownback tax cuts had negatively impacted the Kansas economy but argued that they should be perceived as an anomaly, saying that several other states \"did really well when they lowered taxes\".In 2022, Youngkin signed a two-year, $165 billion state budget featuring $4 billion in tax cuts. According to The Washington Post, the \"centerpiece\" of this budget was \"a big increase in the standard deduction for personal income tax.\" Rather than doubling the standard deduction, as Youngkin had proposed, the budget increased it by about 80%, raising it from $4,500 to $8,000 for individuals and from $9,000 to $16,000 for couples filing jointly. The budget included one-time tax rebates and a partial elimination of Virginia's grocery tax, both of which aligned with Northam's own outgoing budget proposals rather than with Youngkin's preferred tax policies. As Northam had proposed, the one-time tax rebates amounted to $250 for individuals and $500 for couples, slightly less than Youngkin's desired $300 for individuals and $600 for couples, and although the final budget enacted Northam and Youngkin's shared goal of eliminating a 1.5% grocery tax that had been levied by the state, Democrats blocked Youngkin's additional proposal to eliminate a separate 1% grocery tax levied by Virginia localities. Fully included in the budget was Youngkin's proposal to enact a tax exemption of up to $40,000 a year for military pensions. According to The Washington Post, the exemption will be \"phased in over several years.\" Another proposal of Northam's included in the budget was making up to 15% of the earned income tax credit refundable. This policy, designed to benefit low-income tax filers, was described by The Richmond-Times Dispatch as \"a longtime Democratic priority\" and had been opposed by Republicans. It was included in the budget as a compromise between the two parties.Youngkin's goal of offering relief from the state's gas tax was blocked by the legislature along mostly party lines. Democrats argued that the plan proposed by Youngkin would have deprived the state of revenue for transportation projects while offering insufficient relief to consumers. According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, it was estimated that about one-third of the savings from Youngkin's gas tax holiday proposal would have been kept by the oil industry, while about one-quarter of the savings would have gone to out-of-state drivers.

Youngkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies. According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education\". The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone\". Cultural issues and curriculum. Throughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state. Politifact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms. The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students.\" Critics of Youngkin noted that he sent his own children to private schools where resources promoting critical race theory have been recommended. Youngkin served on the governing board for one of those schools from 2016 until 2019 but has distanced himself from anti-racism initiatives that were adopted by the school.The Washington Post identified the Loudoun County school system as \"ground zero for Youngkin's victory\", citing the widespread activism among parents in the county who opposed progressive school policies. Following two sexual assaults that occurred in Loudoun County schools, Youngkin called for campus police to be stationed at every school in Virginia, and after winning the election, he directed the state's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, to investigate the Loudoun County school system's handling of those assaults. Initially, the perpetrator of the assaults was characterized as gender fluid; although this was later denied by the perpetrator's lawyer, conservative media coverage focused on this aspect of the assaults, and the news story fueled opposition to bathroom policies that had been newly adopted in Virginia to accommodate transgender students. Youngkin's Democratic opponent in the election, Terry McAuliffe, said that the assaults were being exploited during the campaign as \"a transphobic dog whistle\".A major subject of opposition among Republicans during the campaign was a state law signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring that all Virginia public schools adopt protections for transgender students. Youngkin has been critical of these protections. While running for governor, he supported teachers who refused to refer to their students by preferred pronouns and argued against allowing transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. As governor, he has stated that he believes public school teachers should be required to out LGBTQ students to their parents. His administration has since announced plans to repeal all of the protections for transgender students that had been introduced under Northam.Youngkin's first official action as governor was to sign an executive order banning Virginia schools from teaching critical race theory. The order also bans critical race theory from teacher diversity trainings and any other materials produced by the Virginia Department of Education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the executive order \"targets various initiatives...including the EdEquityVa Initiative, a program aimed at promoting cultural competency in classrooms, higher teacher diversity, and decreasing suspension rates for Black students.\"This same executive order cancels the Virginia Mathematics Pathways Initiative, a program that had been developed and proposed by the Northam administration in an effort to both close the racial achievement gap and better equip students with modern job skills. According to The Virginian-Pilot, some critics of the program viewed it as \"a dumbing down of standards\". Youngkin called the program a \"left-wing takeover of public education\", and many conservatives claimed that it would have eliminated advanced high school math classes \u2013 a claim that Youngkin gave prominence to during his campaign. James Lane, Virginia Superintendent at the time, and NPR, both disputed this characterization of the program. The Virginia Math Pathways Initiative would have prioritized data science and data analytics over calculus while still offering students the opportunity to enroll in calculus at an accelerated pace.

No plans to eliminate advanced classes existed. Following this, Youngkin signed a bill allowing parents to review and opt their children out of material with \"sexually explicit content,\" a first in the nation. He also advocated for a bill to reverse admissions process reforms aimed at increasing racial diversity in some Governor's Schools, but it failed in the State Senate.

Shortly after Youngkin and other conservatives first began speaking out against the Virginia Math Pathways Initiative, The Washington Post reported that the actual nature of the program had been \"obscured...[by] prominent Virginians and copious coverage from right-wing news outlets\" as \"outrage built online\" among those opposed to it.In early April 2022, Youngkin signed a bill allowing school parents throughout Virginia to review and opt their children out of any educational material containing \"sexually explicit content\"; any opted out student would be provided with alternative material. This is the first statewide law in the nation allowing for parental review of sexually explicit content in school curriculum. Democrats have criticized the bill for taking control over education away from local school systems and have argued that its definition of \"sexually explicit content\" is \"overly broad\". The bill passed along mostly party lines. A similar bill, known as the \"Beloved Bill\", was vetoed by McAuliffe in both 2016 and 2017. That bill, which had originated when a conservative activist took issue with the inclusion of Beloved in her high school senior son's AP English class, became one of the focal points of Virginia's 2021 gubernatorial election, and reviving the bill was identified by The Washington Post as \"one of the key promises\" of Youngkin's campaign. The provisions of the bill will take effect in 2023.In May 2022, Youngkin sent a letter to the Council of Presidents overseeing Virginia colleges and universities, urging mandatory political diversity in their hiring practices. That year, he introduced a budget amendment, which succeeded in the General Assembly, requiring that the state's public colleges and universities promote \"free speech and diversity of thought on [their] campuses.\"In August 2022, Youngkin enlisted the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, to assist in revising Virginia's educational standards for history and social sciences.During the 2022 legislative session, Youngkin advocated for a bill that would have reversed reforms that had been recently adopted to the admissions processes at some Governor's Schools in Virginia, specifically at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria and at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond. The reforms that Youngkin wanted to reverse had been adopted to increase racial diversity among the student bodies at those two schools, where Black and Hispanic students had been consistently underrepresented. Although race blind, the reformed admissions processes achieved their goal by implementing an approach largely based on geographic and socioeconomic factors. The bill supported by Youngkin would have banned such an approach, characterizing the use of geographic and socioeconomic factors as \"proxy discrimination\". This bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but failed in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. A separate bill signed by Youngkin that same year bans Governor's Schools in Virginia \"from discriminating against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the process of admitting students to such school.\" This bill, which received bipartisan support, was described by The Richmond Times-Dispatch as \"a watered-down version\" of Youngkin's preferred bill. According to WRIC-TV, a Virginia ABC News affiliate, it has been argued that the bill signed by Youngkin \"has no legal impact because it largely reiterates existing federal law.\" Tipline for \"divisive practices\". During his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools. The tipline was announced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\""}]}, "correct": false}

Youngkin has called the initiative a \"carbon tax\" and has stated that leaving the initiative would save ratepayers an average of about $50 a year. Democrats have countered that leaving the initiative would cut off a source of revenue for the state that raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year; this revenue is used for flood control and to provide low income ratepayers with energy assistance. On his first day in office, Youngkin signed an executive order calling for a reevaluation of Virginia's membership in the initiative. The Washington Post noted that because Virginia entered the initiative through legislative action, Youngkin may lack the legal authority to withdraw from the initiative without legislative approval. The publication theorized that this legal limitation may have been why Youngkin ultimately ordered a reevaluation of the initiative rather than a withdrawal. In August 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that, despite the likely legal challenges, it would attempt to withdraw Virginia from the initiative by the end of 2023 without seeking legislative approval to do so. Around that same time, Youngkin announced his desire to block a law set to take effect in 2024, which would require that Virginia follow California's vehicle emissions standards.In his 2022 address to the General Assembly, Youngkin called for the state to better protect against pollution of the James River, voiced support for ongoing efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay, and proposed that the state establish a Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority to combat rising sea levels. Later that year, Youngkin opposed the scope of a bill that had been designed to improve Virginia's flood preparedness. According to The Washington Post, Youngkin attempted to \"gut\" the bill by amending it but was overruled by a unanimous vote by the State Senate.In April 2022, Youngkin issued an executive order that rescinded former governor Ralph Northam's order to ban single-use plastics at executive branch state agencies. Although the replacement order issued by Youngkin also directed state agencies to develop a plan for increasing recycling in Virginia and reducing food waste by companies in the state, environmental groups criticized the order, claiming that recycling alone without measures to curb the sale of single-use plastic is \"a clear step in the wrong direction that will result in irreversible damage.\"Additional action taken by Youngkin in April 2022 included signing legislation that revised the state's permit-issuing process for controversial projects with environmental impacts. This revision transferred authority to issue such permits away from two citizen review boards and to the Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees those boards. Virginia's two review boards impacted by the legislation were the Water Control Board and the Air Pollution Control Board. According to VPM, a Virginia NPR affiliate, before Youngkin's legislation, these two review boards were \"only responsible\" for permitting decisions when projects were \"considered to be controversial\". That same publication noted that the review boards almost always based their permitting decisions on recommendations made by the Department of Environmental Quality.Only a few months before the permitting process was changed under Youngkin, the state Air Pollution Control Board had made the decision to deny a permit for a compressor station that would have been part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Air Pollution Control Board made this decision even though the Department of Environmental Quality had recommended approval for the compressor station, and this marked one of only four instances in the preceding twenty years that any citizen review board in Virginia had decided against issuing a permit recommended for approval by that department. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that in making this decision, the Air Pollution Control Board was \"angering business groups\". VPM reported that the decision was cited by Republicans as a reason for transferring permitting authority away from citizen review boards. Although Youngkin's legislation revising the permitting process gained some bipartisan support in the state legislature, it was opposed by environmental groups. Health care. During Virginia's 2022 legislative session, Youngkin vetoed bills that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on the collection of medical debt and prohibited health insurance companies from charging higher premiums for tobacco use.

An amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget took $10 million over two years that had been planned as financial aid for undocumented immigrants pursuing higher education in Virginia and used the money instead to increase financial aid for students attending Virginia's historically black colleges and universities. The amendment was passed by the General Assembly along mostly party lines. According to The Washington Post, half of the money reallocated by the amendment will be \"used to supplement in-state student aid at Norfolk State and Virginia State universities, which are both public institutions\" and the other half will be used to \"increase Virginia Tuition Assistance Grants, a form of aid for residents attending private colleges and universities, to $7,500 from $5,000 a year for students enrolled in historically Black institutions.\" Lamont Bagby, chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, condemned the amendment, calling it the wrong way to help HBCUs. Several Democrats characterized the amendment as an effort to \"pit\" two different disadvantaged student groups against each other. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Youngkin could have drawn from \"up to $50 million in unappropriated money\" in state revenue to assist Virginia's HBCUs, rather than taking money that had been initially allocated to assist undocumented immigrant students. LGBTQ rights. Youngkin personally opposes same-sex marriage, but has said he would not interfere with the issue as governor. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said that he considers same-sex marriage \"legally acceptable\" and that \"as governor, [he] would support [legal same-sex marriage].\" He has maintained the governor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Board but has been criticized by members of that board for what they have described as his lack of meaningful support for the LGBTQ+ community.In June 2022, Youngkin expressed some support for LGBTQ+ Pride Month; he hosted \"a private Pride reception at the Capitol\" but did not invite any of Virginia's openly LGBTQ+ state legislators to the event, which was boycotted by all but one member of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board and by other LGBTQ+ groups. Those who boycotted the event did so because they saw it as inconsistent with Youngkin's policy stances, which they considered to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community. That same month, Youngkin hosted the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ+ Republican group, at the Governor's Mansion. Youngkin rejected a request from the LGBTQ+ Advisory Board to issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month. His decision to hold a Pride event has been condemned by the socially conservative Family Foundation of Virginia, which wrote that Youngkin's choice to celebrate Pride Month \"dismays many people of faith\".In July 2022, shortly after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Youngkin was asked how Virginia would respond if that court were to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the United States. Youngkin responded by stating, \"I can't live in the world of hypotheticals.\" The Virginia Constitution includes an amendment banning same-sex marriage, which, according to Washington Post, \"would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself.\" An effort to repeal that amendment was defeated by Republicans during Youngkin's first year in office. Marijuana. A few months after his inauguration, Youngkin proposed that Virginia recriminalize possessing more than two ounces of marijuana. When the Northam administration, a year earlier, had legalized possessing up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia, it did so while establishing a system in which possessing between one ounce and one pound was made punishable by a $25 fine; possessing over one pound remained a felony. This system made Virginia the only US state to have legalized marijuana possession without having misdemeanor penalties for possessing over the legal amount."}]}, "correct": false}

After spending several weeks in the United States, he fled to the Bahamas. Successfully managing to elude his pursuers, Bifield finally returned to the U.S. in late January 1982 and went to Denver, Colorado, where he was eventually apprehended by United States Marshals Service (USMS) and FBI agents on February 5, 1982.

He was then found guilty on June 10, 1982, of escape from the custody of the United States Attorney General, and was sentenced to an additional five years' imprisonment to be served consecutively.Thirty-seven members and associates of the Bridgeport Hells Angels were arrested on racketeering and drug trafficking charges on May 2, 1985, in connection with a three-year FBI investigation of the club known as Operation Roughrider. The arrests took place in three cities across Connecticut. Among those indicted was an officer of the Bridgeport PD, Joseph Seamons. Two law enforcement officers were injured during the raids; state trooper Angel Gonzalez was wounded when a suspect fired at him through the door of a house in Stratford, and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official suffered a broken toe while using a sledgehammer to break through an armored clubhouse door in Bridgeport. An undercover FBI agent, Kevin P. Bonner, infiltrated the club for over two years and made drug deals with various chapters during the investigation. The operation involved around a thousand law enforcement personnel, and resulted in the arrests of a total of 133 Hells Angels members and associates during approximately fifty coordinated raids carried out in eleven states.

The drug-addicted Kramer eventually became a liability to the operation, however, and was returned to prison after the firearm indictment against him was reinstated in September 2002. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty, and he later entered protective custody. Information on Kramer's role as an informant soon leaked, and Hells Angels leaders in Arizona also began hearing rumors from southern California that the Solo Angeles were imposters. In an effort to ensure credibility, undercover ATF agent Jay Dobyns told the Hells Angels in June 2003 that he and another Solo Angeles biker would be travelling to Sonora to kill Mongols. The ATF then staged the murder of a Mongols member by photographing and videotaping a law enforcement officer posing as the rival biker laying in a shallow grave, splattered with lamb blood and brains. Dobyns had bloodstained Mongols colors mailed to the Hells Angels from Mexico, and provided a videotape and pictures of the staged killing. The ruse proved successful and, according to Dobyns and the ATF, he was subsequently voted in as a member of the Hells Angels' Skull Valley chapter. Sonny Barger and the HAMC have vehemently denied that Dobyns was ever awarded membership.Operation Black Biscuit was ended prematurely because the ATF believed Robert \"Chico\" Mora, a senior member of the Hells Angels' Phoenix chapter, was plotting to murder the Solo Angeles. Mora did not know the Solo Angeles were undercover agents, but believed they were a potential rival encroaching on the Hells Angels' territory. He allegedly assembled a group of veteran Hells Angels enforcers to liquidate the Solo Angeles. The operation culminated with a series of synchronized raids carried out across Arizona on July 8, 2003, and the arrests of fifty-two people; sixteen Hells Angels members and associates were indicted on charges including RICO Act violations, murder and drug trafficking. Over 500 illegal weapons, including silencers, pipe bombs, sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, along with ammunition, $50,000 in cash and drugs were also seized. During one of the raids, on a HAMC clubhouse in North Phoenix, club prospect Michael Wayne Coffelt was shot and wounded with a rifle by police officer Laura Beeler. He was subsequently charged with aggravated assault against Beeler, who reported that Coffelt fired first and was cleared of any wrongdoing in the shooting by county prosecutors. The charges against Coffelt were dismissed in November 2004 when judge Michael Wilkinson of the Maricopa County Superior Court ruled that the police violated state search-and-seizure laws during the raid. Investigators determined that Coffelt never fired at Beeler. Operation Black Biscuit was deemed a success by the ATF, but internal government disagreement ultimately led to the sixteen defendants escaping conviction on the key charges of racketeering and murder. Half of the defendants plea bargained to lesser offenses, and five others had federal charges dismissed. The plea agreements resulted in no more than five-year prison sentences. In 2004, Mora was convicted of the federal charge of possessing body armor with intent to sell and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. The conviction was overturned the following year after an appeal. The Skull Valley chapter disbanded as a result of the investigation. Murder of Cynthia Garcia. On October 27, 2001, full-patch Hells Angels members Kevin J. Augustiniak and Michael Christopher \"Mesa Mike\" Kramer, and prospective member Paul Merle Eischeid murdered Cynthia Yvonne Garcia, a forty-four-year-old mother of six who verbally disrespected the club and its members while in an intoxicated state during a party at the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Mesa. After beating Garcia unconscious, the three bikers loaded her into the trunk of a car and drove her into the desert near the Salt River where they stabbed her twenty-seven times and attempted to decapitate her.

However, withholding the new season of The Voice and benching Revolution until late March, the network's midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network Univision during the February sweeps period. The 2012\u201313 season ended with NBC finishing in third place overall, albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (Revolution, Chicago Fire and Hannibal).. In 2013, NBC Sports migrated its business and production operations (including NBCSN) to new facilities in Stamford, Connecticut. Production of the network's NFL pre-game show Football Night in America remained at the NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center (with production operations based in Studio 8G, while the program itself was broadcast in Studio 8H, the longtime home of Saturday Night Live), until it migrated to the Stamford facility in September 2014. Despite the failure of another highly advertised game show event, The Million Second Quiz, the 2013\u201314 season was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of The Voice, Chicago Fire, Revolution, Sunday Night Football and Grimm. Along with new hits including The Blacklist, Hannibal and Chicago PD and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC became the No. 1 network in the coveted 18\u201349 demographic that season for the first time since 2003\u201304, when Friends ended. NBC also improved considerably in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season.The 2014\u201315 season was something of a mixed bag for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18\u201349 demographic and in second place overall.The 2015\u201316 season was successful for NBC, with the successful launch of the new drama Blindspot premiering after The Voice, then subsequently being renewed for a second season in November 2015. NBC also continued with the success with the Chicago franchise with launching its second spin-off Chicago Med, which also received an early second season pick up in February 2016. Thursday nights continues to be a struggle for NBC, with continued success with the third season of The Blacklist brought the failed launch of Heroes Reborn which was cancelled in January 2016, and thriller The Player; however, NBC found success with police procedural Shades of Blue, which improved in its timeslot and was renewed for a second season in February 2016. On the comedy side, NBC surprisingly found success in the new workplace sitcom Superstore which premiered as a \"preview\" after The Voice in November 2015, and officially launched in January 2016 which brought decent ratings for a new comedy without The Voice as a lead-in and which was subsequently renewed for a second season in February 2016.. The 2016\u201317 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of comedy-drama This Is Us, which was well received by critics and ratings and was renewed for two additional seasons in January 2017. The Blacklist continued to bring in modest ratings, but it brought the failed launch of its spinoff The Blacklist: Redemption. NBC continued to grow the Chicago franchise with a third spinoff titled Chicago Justice.

The network's decision to air a daily prime time talk show with Jay Leno received criticism and was ultimately moved to a later time slot. NBC's reputation for airing quality dramas was a concern among industry executives. The network's ratings were minimally affected by the removal of Leno's show. Comcast announced its acquisition of NBC Universal, and Jeff Zucker stepped down as CEO. Steve Burke and Robert Greenblatt took over as CEO of NBCUniversal and chairman of NBC Entertainment, respectively. In 2011, NBC found a hit with \"The Voice,\" but still struggled with new fall programs. The network transitioned to an all-HD schedule, excluding the Qubo consortium's Saturday morning time slot. The broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI and successful Monday night midseason lineup helped NBC lift itself to third place in the 18-49 demographic. However, the network remained in fourth place in total viewership, with only four shows surviving for a second season, and three of them being cancelled the following year. NBC expanded its sitcom roster in the fall of 2012.", "text": "television rights. Even so, with its continuing position in fourth place (although it virtually tied with ABC in many demographics on the strength of NBC's sports broadcasts that year), the 2009\u201310 season ended with only two scripted shows \u2013 Community and Parenthood, as well as three unscripted shows \u2013 The Marriage Ref, Who Do You Think You Are? and Minute to Win It \u2013 being renewed for second seasons, while other series such as Heroes and veteran crime drama Law & Order (the latter of which ended after 20 seasons, tying it with Gunsmoke as the longest-running prime time drama in U.S. television history) were cancelled. After Conan O'Brien succeeded Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009, the network gave Leno a new prime time talk show, committing to air it every weeknight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific as an inexpensive comedic alternative to the police procedurals and other hour-long dramas typically aired in that time slot. In doing so, NBC became the first major U.S. broadcast network in decades, if ever, to broadcast the same program in a week daily prime time strip. Its executives called the decision \"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\" and \"in effect, launching five shows.\" Conversely, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas in the 10:00 hour, and expressed concern that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted series. Citing complaints from many affiliates, which saw their late-evening newscasts drop significantly in the local ratings during The Jay Leno Show's run, NBC announced on January 10, 2010, that it would drop Leno's show from the 10:00 p.m. slot, with Zucker announcing plans to shift the program (which would have been reduced to a half-hour) into the 11:35 p.m. slot and shift its existing late night lineup (including The Tonight Show) by 30 minutes. The removal of The Jay Leno Show from its prime time schedule had almost no impact on the network's ratings. The increases NBC experienced in the 2010\u201311 season compared to 2009\u201310 were almost entirely attributable to the rising viewership of NBC Sunday Night Football. By 2012, the shows that occupied the 10:00 p.m. time slot drew lower numbers than The Jay Leno Show did when it aired in that hour two years before. In the spring of 2010, cable provider and multimedia firm Comcast announced it would acquire a majority interest in NBC Universal from General Electric, which would retain a minority stake in the company in the interim.. On September 24, 2010, Jeff Zucker announced that he would step down as NBC Universal's CEO once the company's merger with Comcast was completed at the end of the year. After the deal was finalized, Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment. In 2011, NBC was finally able to find a breakout hit in the midseason reality singing competition series The Voice. Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with every single new fall program getting cancelled by season's end \u2013 the third time this has happened to the network after the fall of 1975, and the fall of 1983 \u2013 and the midseason legal drama Harry's Law being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the 2011\u201312 season. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning time slot leased by the Qubo consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when Last Call with Carson Daly converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.. The 2011\u201312 season was another tough season for NBC. On the upside, the network's broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI was the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time, and the network's Monday night midseason lineup of The Voice and musical-drama Smash was very successful. The network managed to lift itself into third place in the 18\u201349 demographic in the 2011\u201312 season, primarily on the strength of those three programs (SNF, The Voice, and Smash), breaking the network's eight-year streak in fourth place. Four shows survived for a second season, but three of them were cancelled in the following year, none were unqualified ratings successes, and the network remained a distant fourth place in total viewership..

In 1923, RCA tried transmitting audio between cities using low-quality telegraph lines, but it failed due to interference. AT&T sold WEAF and WCAP to RCA in 1925, forming the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) with RCA, General Electric, and Westinghouse as owners.

In 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the Orange and Gold Networks. NBC moved to 711 Fifth Avenue in 1933 and developed a shortwave radio network.

During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The creation of WEAF in 1922 offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of \"chain\" or \"networking\" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.. New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.. In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission. Red and Blue Networks. RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shutting down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.. WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the \"Red Network\" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the \"Blue Network\" mostly carried sustaining \u2013 or non-sponsored \u2013 broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.. In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA.

For many years, NBC was closely identified with David Sarnoff, who used it as a vehicle to sell consumer electronics. RCA and Sarnoff had captured the spotlight by introducing all-electronic television to the public at the 1939\u201340 New York World's Fair, simultaneously initiating a regular schedule of programs on the NBC-RCA television station in New York City. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared at the fair before the NBC camera, becoming the first U.S. president to appear on television on April 30, 1939 (an actual, off-the-monitor photograph of the FDR telecast is available at the David Sarnoff Library). The broadcast was transmitted by NBC's New York television station W2XBS Channel 1 (later WNBC-TV; now WNBC, channel 4) and was seen by about 1,000 viewers within the station's roughly 40-mile (64 km) coverage area from its transmitter at the Empire State Building.. The following day (May 1), four models of RCA television sets went on sale to the general public in various department stores around New York City, which were promoted in a series of splashy newspaper ads. DuMont Laboratories (and others) had actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC's announced April 1939 television launch. Later in 1939, NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area, establishing many \"firsts\" in television broadcasting.. Reportedly, the first NBC Television \"network\" program was broadcast on January 12, 1940, when a play titled Meet The Wife was originated at the W2XBS studios at Rockefeller Center and rebroadcast by W2XB/W2XAF (now WRGB) in Schenectady, which received the New York station directly off-air from a tower atop a mountain and relayed the live signal to the Capital District."}]}, "correct": true}

CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.. The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS, and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35\u201345, 18\u201325 or 18\u201335. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society. 1970s doldrums. The 1970s started strongly for NBC thanks to hits like Adam-12, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Ironside, The Dean Martin Show, and The Flip Wilson Show. However, despite the success of such new shows as the NBC Mystery Movie, Sanford and Son, Chico and the Man, Little House on the Prairie, The Midnight Special, The Rockford Files, Police Woman, and Emergency!, as well as continued success from veterans like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Wonderful World of Disney, the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade. Disney, in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put 60 Minutes up against the program in the Sunday 7:00 p.m. time slot in the 1975\u201376 season.. In 1974, under new president Herbert Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, miniseries and specials.

Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as Walt Disney Presents) on ABC; however, ABC president Leonard Goldenson said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.. By 1963, much of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of I Dream of Jeannie and Convoy), and began billing itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the 1966\u201367 season. Days of Our Lives became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.. NBC contracted with Universal Studios in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, See How They Run, which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, The Hanged Man, aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.In 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format."}]}, "correct": false}

In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures. Chimes. The iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as \"the fourth chime\", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations staffed by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G'-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference General Electric (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose radio station in Schenectady, New York, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network. As an example, it is incorporated into the theme music used by NBC News. In the late 1930s, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached an agreement with NBC for B&O to be allowed to NBC's tones to summon the railroad's passengers to dinner on its trains. New beginnings: The Blue Network becomes ABC. In 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency's creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.. After Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name.

Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included Vic and Sade, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve, One Man's Family, Ma Perkins and Death Valley Days. NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique clear-channel national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.. In the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers \u2013 including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra \u2013 jumped to CBS.. In addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian Milton Berle, whose Texaco Star Theater on the network became television's first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of simulcasting. Two of the concerts were historic firsts \u2013 the first complete telecast of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and the first complete telecast of Verdi's Aida (starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.. Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, The Big Show's initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers.

In Great Britain, the Pre-Raphaelites sought a realistic vision of the world with general lighting and maximum detail, as opposed to the side lighting of academicist painting.

Impressionism, led by artists like Claude Monet, prioritized light and color over linear perspective, studying the laws of optics and the physics of light and color.", "text": "These artists painted from life and had as their main objective the reduction of painting to contrasts of light and brilliance. According to Diego Martelli, one of the theorists of the group, \"we affirmed that form did not exist and that, just as in light everything results from color and chiaroscuro, so it is a matter of obtaining tones, the effects of the true\". The Manchists revalued the light contrasts and knew how to transcribe in their canvases the power and clarity of the Mediterranean light. They captured like no one else the effects of the sun on objects and landscapes, as in the painting The Patrol by Giovanni Fattori, in which the artist uses a white wall as a luminous screen on which the figures are cut out. In Great Britain, the school of the Pre-Raphaelites emerged, who were inspired \u2014 as their name indicates \u2014 by Italian painters before Raphael, as well as by the recently emerged photography, with exponents such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt and Ford Madox Brown. The Pre-Raphaelites sought a realistic vision of the world, based on images of great detail, vivid colors and brilliant workmanship; as opposed to the side lighting advocated by academicist painting, they preferred general lighting, which turned paintings into flat images, without great contrasts of light and shadow. To achieve maximum realism, they carried out numerous investigations, as in the painting The Rescuer (1855, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), by John Everett Millais, in which a fireman saves two girls from a fire, for which the artist burned wood in his workshop to find the right lighting. The almost photographic detail of these works led John Ruskin to say of William Holman Hunt's The Wandering Sheep (1852, Tate Britain, London) that \"for the first time in the history of art the absolutely faithful balance between color and shade is achieved, by which the actual brightness of the sun could be transported into a key by which possible harmonies with material pigments should produce on the mind the same impressions as are made by the light itself.\" Hunt was also the author of The Light of the World (1853, Keble College, Oxford University), in which light has a symbolic meaning, related to the biblical passage that identifies Christ with the phrase \"I am the light of the world, he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, for he shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). This painter again portrayed the symbolic light of Jesus Christ in The Awakening of Consciousness (1853, Tate Britain), through the light of the garden streaming through the window. Romanticism and realism were the first artistic movements that rejected the official art of the time, the art taught in the academies \u2014 academicism \u2014 an art that was institutionalized and anchored in the past both in the choice of subjects and in the techniques and resources made available to the artist. In France, in the second half of the 19th century, this art was called art pompier (\"fireman's art\", a pejorative name derived from the fact that many authors represented classical heroes with helmets that resembled fireman's helmets). Although in principle the academies were in tune with the art produced at the time, so we can not speak of a distinct style, in the 19th century, when the evolutionary dynamics of the styles began to move away from the classical canons, academic art was constrained in a classicist style based on strict rules. Academicism was stylistically based on Greco-Roman classicism, but also on earlier classicist authors, such as Raphael, Poussin or Guido Reni. Technically, it was based on careful drawing, formal balance, perfect line, plastic purity and careful detailing, together with realistic and harmonious coloring. Many of its representatives had a special predilection for the nude as an artistic theme, as well as a special attraction for orientalism. Its main representatives were: William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, E\u00f9gene-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. Impressionism. Light played a fundamental role in impressionism, a style based on the representation of an image according to the \"impression\" that light produces to the eye. In contrast to academic art and its forms of representation based on linear perspective and geometry, the Impressionists sought to capture reality on the canvas as they perceived it visually, so they gave all the prominence to light and color. To this end, they used to paint outdoors (en plen air), capturing the various effects of light on the surrounding environment at different times of the day. They studied in depth the laws of optics and the physics of light and color."}, {"summary_score": 0.8626218810437165, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8463832782910541, "text_rank": 9, "summary": "The representation of light in painting, particularly in portraits, requires accurate depiction of physiognomic features and even the subject's psychology, with drawing being crucial to model the features. In the 20th century, abstraction emerged as a new artistic language, where light is used subjectively for its luminosity and chiaroscuro effects. Light also plays a significant role in depicting chronological time in painting, with specific times of day being represented more accurately from the 19th century onwards due to advances in artificial lighting. The first light of the day, dawn, was historically used in landscape paintings to create a spherical effect, but its use to illuminate the foreground only became common from the 17th century onwards.", "text": "Its elaboration is based on the same premises as those of the human body, with the addition of a greater demand in the faithful representation of the physiognomic features and even the need to capture the psychology of the character. The drawing is essential to model the features according to the model and, from there, light and color are again the vehicle of translation of the visual image to its representation on the canvas.In the 20th century, abstraction emerged as a new pictorial language, in which painting is reduced to non-figurative images that no longer describe reality, but rather concepts or sensations of the artist himself, who plays with form, color, light, matter, space and other elements in a totally subjective way and not subject to conventionalisms. Despite the absence of concrete images of the surrounding reality, light is still present on numerous occasions, generally contributing luminosity to the colors or creating chiaroscuro effects by contrasting tonal values. Chronological factor. Another aspect in which light is a determining factor is in time, in the representation of chronological time in painting. Until the Renaissance, artists did not represent a specific time in painting and, in general, the only difference in light was between exterior and interior lights. In many occasions it is difficult to identify the specific time of day in a work, since neither the direction of the light nor its quality nor the dimension of the shadows are decisive elements to recognize a certain time of day. Night was rarely represented until practically Mannerism and, in the cases in which a nocturnal atmosphere was used, it was because the narrative required it or because of some symbolic aspect: in Giotto's The Annunciation to the Shepherds or in Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Annunciation, the nocturnal atmosphere contributes to accentuate the halo of mystery surrounding the birth of Christ; in Uccello's Saint George and the Dragon, night represents evil, the world in which the dragon lives. On the other hand, even in narrative themes that take place at night, such as the Last Supper or the supper at Emmaus, this factor is sometimes deliberately avoided, as in Andrea del Sarto's Last Supper, set in daylight.Generally, the chronological setting of a scene has been linked to its narrative correlate, albeit in an approximate manner and with certain licenses on the part of the artist. Practically until the 19th century, it was not until the industrial civilization, thanks to the advances in artificial lighting, that a complete and exact use of the entire time zone was achieved, thanks to the advances in artificial illumination. But just as in the contemporary age time has had a more realistic component, in the past it was more of a narrative factor, accompanying the action represented: dawn was a time of travel or hunting; noon, of action or its subsequent rest; dusk, of return or reflection; night was sleep, fear or adventure, or fun and passion; birth was morning, death was night.. The temporal dimension began to gain relevance in the 17th century, when artists such as Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa began to detach landscape painting from a narrative context and to produce works in which the protagonist was nature, with the only variations being the time of day or the season of the year. This new conception developed with 18th century's Vedutism and 19th century's Romantic landscape, and culminated with the Impressionism.The first light of the day is that of dawn, sunrise or aurora (sometimes the aurora, which would be the first brightness of the sky, is differentiated from dawn, which would correspond to sunrise). Until the 17th century, dawn appeared only in small pieces of landscape, usually behind a door or a window, but was never used to illuminate the foreground. The light of dawn generally has a spherical effect, so until the appearance of Leonardo's aerial perspective it was not widely used. In his Dictionary of the Fine Arts of Design (1797), Francesco Milizia states that: The dawn sweetly colors the extremity of the bodies, begins to dissipate the darkness of the night and the air still full of vapors leaves the objects wavering.... But the sun has not yet appeared, therefore the shadows cannot be very sensitive. All the bodies must participate in the freshness of the air and remain in a kind of half-ink."}]}, "correct": false}

This symbolic use of light was intended to create a transcendent atmosphere and sacred symbolism, rather than a naturalistic representation. The use of gold leaf, particularly in halos and backgrounds, was common and created areas of high light intensity. As Gothic art evolved, there was a shift towards a more naturalistic use of light, with artists such as Giotto studying how to represent light and shadow to model figures and enhance detail. This was particularly evident in the Flemish Gothic period with the emergence of oil painting, which allowed for brighter colors and greater detail. However, even with this shift towards naturalism, light in Gothic art remained symbolic and was used to create a metaphysical realm linked to the sacred.", "text": "The conjugation of these elementary colors generates light by the overall concordance, thanks to the approximation of the inks, without having to resort to shading effects to outline the contours. The light radiates from the objects, which are luminous without the need for the play of volumes that will be characteristic of modern painting. In particular, the use of gold in medieval miniatures generated areas of great light intensity, often contrasted with cold and light tones, to provide greater chromaticism.However, in painting, light did not have the prominence it had in architecture: medieval \"proper light\" was alien to reality and without contact with the spectator, since it neither came from outside \u2014 lacking a light source \u2014 nor went outward, since it did not expand light. Chiaroscuro was not used, since shadow was forbidden as it was considered a refuge for evil. Light was considered of divine origin and conqueror of darkness, so it illuminated everything equally, with the consequence of the lack of modeling and volume in the objects, a fact that resulted in the weightless and incorporeal image that was sought to emphasize spirituality. Although there is a greater interest in the representation of light, it is more symbolic than naturalistic. Just as in architecture the stained glass windows created a space where illumination took on a transcendent character, in painting a spatial staging was developed through gold backgrounds, which although they did not represent a physical space, they did represent a metaphysical realm, linked to the sacred. This \"gothic light\" was a feigned illumination and created a type of unreal image that transcended mere nature.. The \"unnatural\" light of Gothic art is also presented as the bearer of a world of images of great figurative opulence, whose power acts with extraordinary force on the soul of man.. The gold background reinforced the sacred symbolism of light: the figures are immersed in an indeterminate space of unnatural light, a scenario of sacred character where figures and objects are part of the religious symbolism. Cennino Cennini (Il libro dell'Arte), compiled various technical procedures for the use of gold leaf in painting (backgrounds, draperies, nimbuses), which remained in force until the 16th century. Gold leaf was used profusely, especially in halos and backgrounds, as can be seen in Duccio's Maest\u00e0, which shone brightly in the interior of the cathedral of Siena. Sometimes, before applying the gold leaf, a layer of red clay was spread; after wetting the surface and placing the gold leaf, it was smoothed and polished with ivory or a smooth stone. To achieve more brilliance and to catch the light, incisions were made in the gilding. It is noteworthy that in early Gothic painting there are no shadows, but the entire representation is uniformly illuminated; according to Hans Jantzen, \"to the extent that medieval painting suppresses the shadow, it raises its sensitive light to the power of a super-sensible light\".In Gothic painting there is a progressive evolution in the use of light: the linear or Franco-Gothic Gothic was characterized by linear drawing and strong chromaticism, and gave greater importance to the luminosity of flat color than to tonality, emphasizing chromatic pigment as opposed to luminous gradation. With the Italic or Trecentist Gothic a more naturalistic use of light began, characterized by the approach to the representation of depth \u2014 which would crystallize in the Renaissance with the linear perspective \u2014 the studies on anatomy and the analysis of light to achieve tonal nuance, as seen in the work of Cimabue, Giotto, Duccio, Simone Martini, and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. In the Flemish Gothic period, the technique of oil painting emerged, which provided brighter colors and allowed their gradation in different chromatic ranges, while facilitating greater detail in the details (Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, Gerard David).Between the 13th and 14th centuries a new sensibility towards a more naturalistic representation of reality emerged in Italy, which had as one of its contributing factors the study of a realistic light in the pictorial composition. In the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel (Padua), Giotto studied how to distinguish flat and curved surfaces by the presence or absence of gradients and how to distinguish the orientation of flat surfaces by three tones: lighter for horizontal surfaces, medium for frontal vertical surfaces and darker for receding vertical surfaces. Giotto was the first painter to represent sunlight, a type of soft, transparent illumination, but one that already served to model figures and enhance the quality of clothes and objects."}, {"summary_score": 0.7941764585820693, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.7912050763003837, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "In Christian traditions, light is a significant symbol representing divinity, truth, virtue, and salvation, with various practices and symbols embodying this association.

In patristics, light is a symbol of eternity and the heavenly world: according to Saint Bernard, souls separated from the body will be \"plunged into an immense ocean of eternal light and luminous eternity\". On the other hand, in ancient Christianity, baptism was initially called \"illumination\".In Orthodox Christianity, light is, more than a symbol, a \"real aspect of divinity,\" according to Vladimir Lossky. A reality that can be apprehended by the human being, as expressed by Saint Simeon the New Theologian: [God] never appears as any image or figure, but shows himself in his simplicity, formed by light without form, incomprehensible, ineffable.. Because of the opposition of light and darkness, this element has also been used on occasions as a repeller of demons, so that light has often been represented in various acts and ceremonies such as circumcision, baptisms, weddings or funerals, in the form of candles or fires.. In Christian iconography, light is also present in the halos of the saints, which used to be made \u2014especially in medieval art \u2014 with a golden nimbus, a circle of light placed around the heads of saints, angels and members of the Holy Family. In Fra Angelico's The Annunciation, in addition to the halo, the artist placed rays of light radiating from the figure of the archangel Gabriel, to emphasize his divinity, the same resource he uses with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. On other occasions, it is God himself who is represented in the form of rays of sunlight, as in The Baptism of Christ (1445) by Piero della Francesca. The rays can also signify God's wrath, as in The Tempest (1505) by Giorgione. On other occasions light represents eternity or divinity: in the vanitas genre, beams of light used to focus on objects whose transience was to be emphasized as a symbol of the ephemerality of life, as in Vanities (1645) by Harmen Steenwijck, where a powerful beam of light illuminates the skull in the center of the painting.Between the 14th and 15th centuries Italian painters used supernatural-looking lights in night scenes to depict miracles: for example, in the Annunciation to the Shepherds by Taddeo Gaddi (Santa Croce, Florence) or in the Stigmatization of Saint Francis by Gentile da Fabriano (1420, private collection). In the 16th century, supernatural lights with brilliant effects were also used to point out miraculous events, as in Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald's Risen Christ (1512-1516, Isenheim altar, Museum Unterlinden, Colmar) or in Titian's Annunciation (1564, San Salvatore, Venice). In the following century, Rembrandt and Caravaggio identified light in their works with divine grace and as an agent of action against evil. The Baroque was the period in which light became more symbolic: in medieval art the luminosity of the backgrounds, of the halos of the saints and other objects \u2014 generally made with gold leaf \u2014 was an attribute that did not correspond to real luminosity, while in the Renaissance it responded more to a desire for experimentation and aesthetic delight; Rembrandt was the first to combine both concepts, the divine light is a real, sensory light, but with a strong symbolic charge, an instrument of revelation.. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, mystical theories of light were abandoned as philosophical rationalism gained ground. From transcendental or divine light, a new symbolism of light evolved that identified it with concepts such as knowledge, goodness or rebirth, and opposed it to ignorance, evil and death. Descartes spoke of an \"inner light\" capable of capturing the \"eternal truths\", a concept also taken up by Leibniz, who distinguished between lumi\u00e8re naturelle (natural light) and lumi\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e (revealed light).In the 19th century light was related by the German Romantics (Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) to nature, in a pantheistic sense of communion with nature. For Schelling, light was a medium in which the \"universal soul\" (Weltseele) moved. For Hegel, light was the \"ideality of matter\", the foundation of the material world.Between the 19th and 20th centuries, a more scientific view of light prevailed."}]}, "correct": true}

Salomon van Ruysdael, in particular, sought to capture atmosphere through tonalities, studying the light at different times of the day.", "text": "Vermeer imprinted his works \u2014 generally everyday scenes in interior spaces \u2014 with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres. He used a technique called pointill\u00e9, a series of dots of pigment with which he enhanced the objects, on which he often applied a luminosity that made the surfaces reflect the light in a special way. Vermeer's light softens the contours without losing the solidity of the forms, in a combination of softness and precision that few other artists have achieved.. Nicknamed the \"painter of light\", Vermeer masterfully synthesized light and color, he knew how to capture the color of light like no one else. In his works, light is itself a color, while shadow is inextricably linked to light. Vermeer's light is always natural, he does not like artificial light, and generally has a tone close to lemon yellow, which together with the dull blue and light gray were the main colors of his palette. It is the light that forms the figures and objects, and in conjunction with the color is what fixes the forms. As for the shadows, they are interspersed in the light, reversing the contrast: instead of fitting the luminous part of the painting into the shadows, it is the shadows that are cut out of the luminous space. Contrary to the practice of chiaroscuro, in which the form is progressively lost in the half-light, Vermeer placed a foreground of dark color to increase the tonal intensity, which reaches its zenith in the middle light; from here he dissolves the color towards white, instead of towards black as was done in chiaroscuro. In Vermeer's work, the painting is an organized structure through which light circulates, is absorbed and diffused by the objects that appear on the scene. He builds the forms thanks to the harmony between light and color, which is saturated, with a predominance of pure colors and cold tones. The light gives visual existence to the space, which in turn receives and diffuses it.. In Vermeer, light is never artificial: it is precise and normal like that of nature, and of an accuracy capable of satisfying the most scrupulous physicist. [...] This accuracy of light in Vermeer is due to the harmony of the coloring.. Other prominent Dutch painters were Frans Hals and Jacob Jordaens. The former had a Caravaggist phase between 1625 and 1630, with a clear chromaticism and diffuse luminosity (The Merry Drinker, 1627-1628, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Malle Babbe, 1629-1630, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin), to evolve later to a more sober, dark and monochromatic style. Jordaens had a style characterized by a bright and fantastic coloring, with strong contrasts of light and shadow and a technique of dense impasto. Between 1625 and 1630 he had a period in which he deepened the luminous values of his images, in works such as The Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia (1628, Church of Saint Augustine, Antwerp) or The Fecundity of the Earth (1630, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). One should also mention Godfried Schalcken, a disciple of Gerard Dou who worked not only in his native country but also in England and Germany. An excellent portraitist, in many of his works he used artificial candlelight or candle light, influenced by Rembrandt, as in Portrait of William III (1692-1697, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), Portrait of James Stuart, Duke of Lennox and Richmond (1692-1696, Leiden Collection, New York), Young Man and Woman Studying a Statue of Venus by Lamplight (c. 1690, Leiden Collection, New York) or Old Man Reading by Candlelight (c. 1700, Museo del Prado, Madrid).. A genre that flourished in Holland in an exceptional way in this century was landscape painting, which, in line with the mannerist landscape painting of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Joos de Momper, developed a new sensitivity to atmospheric effects and the reflections of the sun on water. Jan van Goyen was its first representative, followed by artists such as Salomon van Ruysdael, Jacob van Ruysdael, Meindert Hobbema, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle and Adriaen van de Velde.

Giotto focused on distinguishing surface types and orientations using gradients and tone. The van Eyck brothers, particularly Hubert, made strides in capturing various plays of light and naturalistic lighting effects. Jan van Eyck developed a technique of oil painting that used glazes to create atmospheric luminosity and greater depth. Other Dutch artists, such as Dirk Bouts, Petrus Christus, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, also contributed to the exploration of light in art. This period saw a shift towards naturalistic representation of light, while still retaining its symbolic and metaphysical significance. The Early Renaissance was characterized by a return to rationalism, empirical research, and a focus on nature, with theology taking a back seat to humanism. The use of canvas and oil painting became widespread, allowing for greater chromatic richness and representation of light effects in a wider range of shades. Light in Early Renaissance art often appeared intense in the foreground, gradually diminishing towards the background.", "text": "In the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel (Padua), Giotto studied how to distinguish flat and curved surfaces by the presence or absence of gradients and how to distinguish the orientation of flat surfaces by three tones: lighter for horizontal surfaces, medium for frontal vertical surfaces and darker for receding vertical surfaces. Giotto was the first painter to represent sunlight, a type of soft, transparent illumination, but one that already served to model figures and enhance the quality of clothes and objects. For his part, Taddeo Gaddi \u2014 in his Annunciation to the Shepherds (Baroncelli Chapel, Santa Croce, Florence) \u2014 depicted divine light in a night scene with a visible light source and a rapid fall in the pattern of light distribution characteristic of point sources of light, through contrasts of yellow and violet.. In the Netherlands, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin sought to capture various plays of light on surfaces of different textures and sheen, imitating the reflections of light on mirrors and metallic surfaces and highlighting the brilliance of colored jewels and gems (Triptych of M\u00e9rode, by Campin, 1425-1428; Polyptych of Ghent, by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, 1432). Hubert was the first to develop a certain sense of saturation of light in his Hours of Turin (1414-1417), in which he recreated the first \"modern landscapes\" of Western painting \u2014 according to Kenneth Clark. In these small landscapes the artist recreates effects such as the reflection of the evening sky on the water or the light sparkling on the waves of a lake, effects that would not be seen again until the Dutch landscape painting of the 17th century. In the Ghent Polyptych (1432, Saint Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent), by Hubert and Jan, the landscape of The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb melts into light in the celestial background, with a subtlety that only the Baroque Claude of Lorraine would later achieve.Jan van Eyck developed the light experiments of his brother and managed to capture an atmospheric luminosity of naturalistic aspect in his works, in paintings such as The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin (1435, Louvre Museum, Paris), or The Arnolfini Marriage (1434, The National Gallery, London), where he combines the natural light that enters through two side windows with that of a single candle lit on the candlestick, which here has a more symbolic than plastic value, since it symbolizes human life. In Van Eyck's workshop, oil painting was developed, which gave a greater luminosity to the painting thanks to the glazes: in general, they applied a first layer of tempera, more opaque, on which they applied the oil (pigments ground in oil), which is more transparent, through several thin layers that let the light pass through, achieving greater luminosity, depth and tonal and chromatic richness.. Other Dutch artists who stood out in the expression of light were: Dirk Bouts, who in his works enhances with light the coloring and, in general, the plastic sense of the composition; Petrus Christus, whose use of light approaches a certain abstraction of the forms; and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, author in some of his works of surprising light effects, as in his Nativity (1490, National Gallery, London), where the light emanates from the body of the Child Jesus in the cradle, symbol of the Divine Grace. Modern Age Art. Renaissance. The art of the Modern Age \u2014 not to be confused with modern art, which is often used as a synonym for contemporary art \u2014 began with the Renaissance, which emerged in Italy in the 15th century (Quattrocento), a style influenced by classical Greco-Roman art and inspired by nature, with a more rational and measured component, based on harmony and proportion. Linear perspective emerged as a new method of composition and light became more naturalistic, with an empirical study of physical reality. Renaissance culture meant a return to rationalism, the study of nature, empirical research, with a special influence of classical Greco-Roman philosophy. Theology took a back seat and the object of study of the philosopher returned to the human being (humanism).In the Renaissance, the use of canvas as a support and the technique of oil painting became widespread, especially in Venice from 1460. Oil painting provided a greater chromatic richness and facilitated the representation of brightness and light effects, which could be represented in a wider range of shades. In general, Renaissance light tended to be intense in the foreground, diminishing progressively towards the background."}]}, "correct": true}

Caravaggio was a key figure in this movement, using strong spotlights of directed light in dark interiors to emphasize characters and create a structural role for light in his compositions. He was influenced by Leonardo da Vinci's chiaroscuro and used sharp contrasts between light and dark to configure space and determine the position and prominence of figures. Caravaggio's use of diagonal light entry and his dramatic use of light and shadow became hallmarks of his style. Other artists, such as Artemisia Gentileschi, were influenced by Caravaggio's techniques and incorporated them into their own work. Gentileschi's famous painting \"Judith beheading Holofernes\" features strong contrasts between light and dark to emphasize the drama of the scene.", "text": "These effects have a strong dramatism, which emphasizes the scenes represented, generally of religious type, although they also abound in mythological scenes, still lifes or vanitas. One of its main representatives was Caravaggio, as well as Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Pieter van Laer (il Bamboccio), Adam Elsheimer, Gerard van Honthorst, Georges de La Tour, Valentin de Boulogne, the Le Nain brothers and Jos\u00e9 de Ribera (lo Spagnoletto).. Caravaggio was a pioneer in the dramatization of light, in scenes set in dark interiors with strong spotlights of directed light that used to emphasize one or more characters. With this painter, light acquired a structural character in painting, since, together with drawing and color, it would become one of its indispensable elements. He was influenced by Leonardo's chiaroscuro through The Virgin of the Rocks, which he was able to contemplate in the church of San Francesco il Grande in Milan. For Caravaggio, light served to configure the space, controlling its direction and expressive force. He was aware of the artist's power to shape the space at will, so in the composition of a work he would previously establish which lighting effects he was going to use, generally opting for sharp contrasts between the figures and the background, with darkness as a starting point: the figures emerge from the dark background and it is the light that determines their position and their prominence in the scene represented. Caravaggiesque light is conceptual, not imitative or symbolic, so it transcends materiality and becomes something substantial. It is a projected and solid light, which constitutes the basis of its spatial conception and becomes another volume in space.. His main hallmark in depicting light was the diagonal entry of light, which he first used in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (1593-1594, Galleria Borghese, Rome). In La bonaventure (1595-1598, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris) he used a warm golden light of the sunset, which falls directly on the young man and obliquely on the gypsy woman. His pictorial maturity came with the canvases for the Contarelli chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome (1599-1600): The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Vocation of Saint Matthew. In the first, he established a composition formed by two diagonals defined by the illuminated planes and the shadows that form the volume of the figures, in a complex composition cohesive thanks to the light, which relates the figures to each other. In the second, a powerful beam of light that enters diagonally from the upper right directly illuminates the figure of Matthew, a beam parallel to the raised arm of Jesus and that seems to accompany his gesture; an open shutter of the central window cuts this beam of light at the top, leaving the left side of the image in semi-darkness. In works such as the Crucifixion of Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600-1601, Cerasi Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) light makes objects and people glow, to the point that it becomes the true protagonist of the works; these scenes are immersed in light in a way that constitutes more than a simple attribute of reality, but rather the medium through which reality manifests itself. In the final stage of his career he accentuated the dramatic tension of his works through a luminism of flashing effects, as in Seven Works of Mercy (1607, Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples), a nocturne with several spotlights of light that help to emphasize the acts of mercy depicted in simultaneous action.. Artemisia Gentileschi trained with her father, Orazio Gentileschi, coinciding with the years when Caravaggio lived in Rome, whose work she could appreciate in San Luigi dei Francesi and Santa Maria del Popolo. His work was channeled in the tenebrist naturalism, assuming its most characteristic features: expressive use of light and chiaroscuro, dramatism of the scenes and figures of round anatomy. His most famous work is Judith beheading Holofernes (two versions: 1612-1613, Museo Capodimonte, Naples; and 1620, Uffizi, Florence), where the light focuses on Judith, her maid and the Assyrian general, against a complete darkness, emphasizing the drama of the scene."}, {"summary_score": 0.8142292721665974, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8124375034950563, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "During the Baroque period, the Caravaggist School of Utrecht in Holland, including artists Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, adopted Caravaggio's style and chiaroscuro techniques. Terbrugghen softened Caravaggio's thematic repertoire, using grayish-silver chromatism and clarity in his work. Van Baburen focused on full light effects and intense volumes, while Honthorst mastered artificial light in night scenes. Rembrandt, another notable artist, used symbolic and divine light, often concentrating it in one area to create glowing luminosity and dematerialize bodies. He also interacted light and shadow to dissolve contours and deform forms. Vermeer, known as the \"painter of light,\" imbued his works with a pale luminosity, softening contours while preserving form solidity. He masterfully synthesized light and color, making light a color itself and linking shadow to light.", "text": "Among its members were Hendrik Terbrugghen, Dirck van Baburen, and Gerard van Honthorst, all three trained in Rome. The first assumed the thematic repertoire of Caravaggio but with a more sweetened tone, with a sharp drawing, a grayish-silver chromatism and an atmosphere of soft light clarity. Van Baburen sought full light effects rather than chiaroscuro contrasts, with intense volumes and contours. Honthorst was a skillful producer of night scenes, which earned him the nickname Gherardo delle Notti (\"Gerard of the Nights\"). In works such as Christ before the High Priest (1617), Nativity (1622), The Prodigal Son (1623) or The Procuress (1625), he showed great mastery in the use of artificial light, generally from candles, with one or two light sources that illuminated the scene unevenly, highlighting the most significant parts of the painting and leaving the rest in semi-darkness. Of his Christ on the Column, Joachim von Sandrart said: \"the brightness of the candles and lights illuminates everything with a naturalness that resembles life so closely that no art has ever reached such heights\".. One of the greatest exponents of the symbolic use of light was Rembrandt, an original artist with a strong personal stamp, with a style close to tenebrism but more diffused, without the marked contrasts between light and shadow typical of the Caravaggists, but a more subtle and diffuse penumbra. According to Giovanni Arpino, Rembrandt \"invented light, not as heat, but as value. He invented light not to illuminate, but to make his world unapproachable\". In general, he elaborated images where darkness predominated, illuminated in certain parts of the scene by a ray of zenithal light of divine connotation; if the light is inside the painting it means that the world is circumscribed to the illuminated part and nothing exists outside this light. Rembrandtian light is a reflection of an external force, which affects the objects causing them to radiate energy, like the retransmission of a message. Although he starts from tenebrism, his contrasts of light and shadow are not as sharp as those of Caravaggio, but he likes more a kind of golden shadows that give a mysterious air to his paintings. In Rembrandt, light was something structural, integrated in form, color and space, in such a way that it dematerializes bodies and plays with the texture of objects. It is a light that is not subject to the laws of physics, which he generally concentrates in one area of the painting, creating a glowing luminosity. In his work, light and shadow interact, dissolving the contours and deforming the forms, which become the sustaining object of the light. According to Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ne, in Rembrandt light and darkness are actually two types of light, one bright and the other dark. He used to use a canvas as a reflecting or diffusing screen, which he regulated as he wished to obtain the desired illumination in each scene. His concern for light led him not only to his pictorial study, but also to establish the correct placement of his paintings for optimal visualization; thus, in 1639 he advised Constantijn Huygens on the placement of his painting Samson blinded by the Philistines: \"hang this painting where there is strong light, so that it can be seen from a certain distance, and thus it will have the best effect\". Rembrandt also masterfully captured light in his etchings, such as The Hundred Florins and The Three Crosses, in which light is almost the protagonist of the scene.. Rembrandt picked up the luminous tradition of the Venetian school, as did his compatriot Johannes Vermeer, although while the former stands out for his fantastic effects of light, the latter develops in his work a luminosity of great quality in the local tones. Vermeer imprinted his works \u2014 generally everyday scenes in interior spaces \u2014 with a pale luminosity that created placid and calm atmospheres. He used a technique called pointill\u00e9, a series of dots of pigment with which he enhanced the objects, on which he often applied a luminosity that made the surfaces reflect the light in a special way. Vermeer's light softens the contours without losing the solidity of the forms, in a combination of softness and precision that few other artists have achieved.. Nicknamed the \"painter of light\", Vermeer masterfully synthesized light and color, he knew how to capture the color of light like no one else.

Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving \"an elevated style of landscape\" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting. He also painted biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component, as in his Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time. An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one. Church was Cole's first disciple, who transmitted to him his vision of a majestic and exuberant nature, which he reflected in his scenes of the American West and the South American tropics. Bierstadt, of German origin, was influenced by Turner, whose atmospheric effects are seen in works such as In the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D. C.), a lake between mountains seen after a storm, with the sun's rays breaking through the clouds. Heade was devoted to country landscapes of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, in meadows of endless horizons with clear or cloudy skies and lights of various times of day, sometimes refracted by humid atmospheres. Fitz Henry Lane is considered the greatest exponent of luminism. Handicapped since childhood by polio, he focused on the landscape of his native Gloucester (Massachusetts), with works that denote the influence of the English seascape painter Robert Salmon, in which light has a special role, a placid light that gives a sense of eternity, of time stopped in a serene perfection and harmony. Suydam focused on the coastal landscapes of New York and Rhode Island, in which he was able to reflect the light effects of the Atlantic coast. Kensett was influenced by Constable and devoted himself to the New England landscape with a special focus on the luminous reflections of the sky and the sea. Silva also excelled in the seascape, a genre in which he masterfully captured the subtle gradations of light in the coastal atmosphere. Cropsey combined the panoramic effect of the Hudson River School with the more serene luminism of Lane and Heade, with a meticulous and somewhat theatrical style. Bingham masterfully captured in his scenes of the Far West the limpid and clear light of dawn, his favorite when recreating scenes with American Indians and pioneers of the conquest of the West.. Winslow Homer, considered the best American painter of the second half of the 19th century, who excelled in both oil and watercolor and in both landscape and popular scenes of American society, deserves special mention. One of his favorite genres was the seascape, in which he displayed a great interest in atmospheric effects and the changing lights of the day. His painting Moonlight. Wood Island Lighthouse (1894, Museum of Modern Art, New York) was painted entirely by moonlight, in five hours of work. Another important school was Belgian Luminism. In Belgium, the influence of French Impressionism was strongly felt, initially in the work of the group called Les Vingt, as well as in the School of Tervueren, a group of landscape painters who already showed their interest in light, especially in the atmospheric effects, as can be seen in the work of Isidore Verheyden. Later, Pointillism was the main influence on Belgian artists of the time, a trend embraced by \u00c9mile Claus and Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe, the main representatives of Belgian Luminism. Claus adopted Impressionist techniques, although he maintained academic drawing as the basis for his compositions, and in his work \u2014 mainly landscapes \u2014 he showed great interest in the study of the effects of light in different atmospheric conditions, with a style that sometimes recalls Monet. Rysselberghe was influenced by Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as by the Baroque painter Frans Hals and Spanish painting. His technique was of loose and vigorous brushwork, with great luminous contrasts.A luminist school also emerged in the Netherlands, more closely linked to the incipient Fauvism, in which Jan Toorop, Leo Gestel, Jan Sluyters, and the early work of Piet Mondrian stood out."}, {"summary_score": 0.7975243335632431, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8117343924806576, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "In the late 19th century, various artists emerged who emphasized light representation, known as \"luminism.\" This style appeared in different countries, each with unique characteristics.

The term luminism was introduced by John Ireland Howe Baur in 1954 to designate the landscape painting done in the United States between 1840 and 1880, which he defines as \"a polished and meticulous realism in which there are no noticeable brushstrokes and no trace of impressionism, and in which atmospheric effects are achieved by infinitely careful gradations of tone, by the most exact study of the relative clarity of nearer and more distant objects, and by an accurate rendering of the variations of texture and color produced by direct or reflected rays\".The first was American Luminism, which gave rise to a group of landscape painters generally grouped in the so-called Hudson River School, in which we can include to a greater or lesser extent Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Martin Johnson Heade, Fitz Henry Lane, John Frederick Kensett, James Augustus Suydam, Francis Augustus Silva, Jasper Francis Cropsey and George Caleb Bingham. In general, his works were based on bombastic compositions, with a horizon line of great depth and a sky of veiled aspect, with atmospheres of strong expressiveness. His light is serene and peaceful, reflecting a mood of love for nature, a nature largely in the United States of the time virgin and paradisiacal, yet to be explored. It is a transcendent light, of spiritual significance, whose radiance conveys a message of communion with nature. Although they use a classical structure and composition, the treatment of light is original because of the infinity of subtle variations in tonality, achieved through a meticulous study of the natural environment of their country. According to Barbara Novak, Luminism is a more serene form of the romantic aesthetic concept of the sublime, which had its translation in the deep expanses of the North American landscape.. Some historians differentiate between pure Luminism and Hudson River School landscape painting: in the former, the landscape \u2014 more centered in the New England area \u2014 is more peaceful, more anecdotal, with delicate tonal gradations characterized by a crystalline light that seems to emanate from the canvas, in neat brushstrokes that seem to recreate the surface of a mirror and in compositions in which the excess of detail is unreal due to its straightness and geometrism, resulting in an idealization of nature. Thus understood, Luminism would encompass Heade, Lane, Kensett, Suydam and Silva. Hudson River landscape painting, on the other hand, would have a more cosmic vision and a predilection for a wilder and more grandiloquent nature, with more dramatic visual effects, as seen in the work of Cole, Durand, Church, Bierstadt, Cropsey and Bingham. It must be said, however, that neither group ever accepted these labels.. Thomas Cole was the pioneer of the school. English by birth, one of his main references was Claude Lorrain. Settled in New York in 1825, he began to paint landscapes of the Hudson River area, with the aim of achieving \"an elevated style of landscape\" in which the moral message was equivalent to that of history painting. He also painted biblical subjects, in which light has a symbolic component, as in his Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Durand was a little older than Cole and, after Cole's premature death, was considered the best American landscape painter of his time. An engraver by trade, from 1837 he turned to natural landscape painting, with a more intimate and picturesque vision of nature than Cole's allegorical one."}]}, "correct": true}

The Sitges School of Luminism in Catalonia, active from 1878 to 1892, favored vibrant Mediterranean light and atmospheric effects, opposing the softer Olot School. Symbolism, an artistic movement from the late 1800s, focused on the dreamlike and spiritual, often using light symbolically and aesthetically, diverging from naturalism and realism.", "text": "They are preferably seascape, with a warm Mediterranean light of which he feels special predilection for that of the month of September, more golden. From 1906 he lowered the intensity of his palette, with a more nuanced tonality and a predilection for mauve ink; he continued with the seascapes, but increased the production of other types of landscapes, as well as gardens and portraits. He summered in Biarritz and the pale and soft light of the Atlantic Ocean made him lower the luminosity of his works. He also continues with his Valencian scenes: Paseo a orillas del mar (1909), Despu\u00e9s del ba\u00f1o (1909). Between 1909 and 1910 his stays in Andalusia induced him to blur the contours, with a technique close to pointillism, with a predominance of white, pink, and mauve. Among his last works is La bata rosa (1916), in which he unleashes an abundance of light that filters through all parts of the canvas, highlighting the use of light and color on the treatment of the contours, which appear blurred.. The Luminist School of Sitges emerged in Catalonia, active in this town in the Garraf between 1878 and 1892. Its most prominent members were Arcadi Mas i Fondevila, Joaquim de Mir\u00f3, Joan Batlle i Amell, Antoni Almirall and Joan Roig i Soler. Opposed in a certain way to the Olot School, whose painters treated the landscape of the interior of Catalonia with a softer and more filtered light, the Sitgetan artists opted for the warm and vibrant Mediterranean light and the atmospheric effects of the Garraf coast. Heirs to a large extent of Fortuny, the members of this school sought to faithfully reflect the luminous effects of the surrounding landscape, in harmonious compositions that combined verism and a certain poetic and idealized vision of nature, with a subtle chromaticism and a fluid brushstroke that was sometimes described as impressionist.The Sitges School is generally considered a precursor of Catalan modernism: two of its main representatives, Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol, spent several seasons in the town of Sitges, where they adopted the custom of painting d'apr\u00e8s nature and assumed as the protagonist of their works the luminosity of the environment that surrounded them, although with other formal and compositional solutions in which the influence of French painting is evident. Casas studied in Paris, where he was trained in impressionism, with special influence of Degas and Whistler. His technique stands out for the synthetic brushstroke and the somewhat blurred line, with a theme focused preferably on interiors and outdoor images, as well as popular scenes and social vindication. Rusi\u00f1ol showed a special sensitivity for the capture of light especially in his landscapes and his series of Gardens of Spain \u2014 he especially loved the gardens of Mallorca (the sones) and Granada \u2014 in which he developed a great ability for the effects of light filtered between the branches of the trees, creating unique environments where light and shadow play capriciously. Likewise, Rusi\u00f1ol's light shows the longing for the past, for the time that flees, for the instant frozen in time whose memory will live on in the artist's work. From the 1880s until the turn of the century, symbolism was a fantastic and dreamlike style that emerged as a reaction to the naturalism of the realist and impressionist currents, placing special emphasis on the world of dreams, as well as on satanic and terrifying aspects, sex and perversion. A main characteristic of symbolism was aestheticism, a reaction to the prevailing utilitarianism of the time and to the ugliness and materialism of the industrial era. Symbolism gave art and beauty an autonomy of their own, synthesized in Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's formula \"art for art's sake\" (L'art pour l'art). This current was also linked to modernism (also known as Art Nouveau in France, Modern Style in the United Kingdom, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria or Liberty in Italy). Symbolism was an anti-scientific and anti-naturalist movement, so light lost objectivity and was used as a symbolic element, in conjunction with the rest of the visual and iconographic resources of this style. It is a transcendent light, which behind the material world suggests a spirituality, whether religious or pantheistic, or perhaps simply a state of mind of the artist, a feeling, an emotion."}, {"summary_score": 0.8385902748372588, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.833894362315932, "text_rank": 1, "summary": "In the late 19th century, various artists emerged who sought to express their emotions and capture the essence of their subjects through color and light.

Giovanni Segantini, a personal artist who combined a drawing of academicist tradition with a post-impressionist coloring where the light effects have a great relief. Segantini's specialty was the mountain landscape, which he painted outdoors, with a technique of strong brushstrokes and simple colors, with a vibrant light that he only found in the high alpine mountains. In Germany, impressionism was represented by Fritz von Uhde, Lovis Corinth, and Max Slevogt. The first was more of a plenairist than strictly an impressionist, although more than landscape painting he devoted himself to genre painting, especially of religious themes, works in which he also showed a special sensitivity to light. Corinth had a rather eclectic career, from academic beginnings \u2014 he was a disciple of Bouguereau \u2014 through realism and impressionism, to a certain decadentism and an approach to Jugendstil, to finally end up in expressionism. Influenced by Rembrandt and Rubens, he painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes with a serene and brilliant chromatism. Slevogt assumed the fresh and brilliant chromatism of the Impressionists, although renouncing the fragmentation of colors that they made, and his technique was of loose brushstrokes and energetic movement, with bold and original light effects, which denote a certain influence of the baroque art of his native Bavaria.. In Great Britain, the work of James Abbott McNeil Whistler, American by birth but established in London since 1859, stood out. His landscapes are the antithesis of the sunny French landscapes, as they recreate the foggy and taciturn English climate, with a preference for night scenes, images from which he nevertheless knows how to distill an intense lyricism, with artificial light effects reflected in the waters of the Thames.In the United States, it is worth mentioning the work of John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam. Sargent was an admirer of Vel\u00e1zquez and Frans Hals, and excelled as a social portraitist, with a virtuoso and elegant technique, both in oil and watercolor, the latter mainly in landscapes of intense color. Cassatt lived for a long time in Paris, where he was related to the Impressionist circle, with whom he shared more the themes than the technique, and developed an intimate and sophisticated work, influenced by Japanese prints. Hassam's main motif was New York life, with a fresh but somewhat cloying style.. Mention should also be made of Scandinavian impressionism, many of whose artists were trained in Paris. These painters had a special sensitivity to light, perhaps due to its absence in their native land, so they traveled to France and Italy attracted by the \"light of the south\". The main exponents were Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, and Anders Zorn. The former showed a special interest in highly complex lighting effects, such as the mixing of natural and artificial light. Gallen-Kallela was an original artist who later approached symbolism, with a personal expressive and stylized painting with a tendency towards romanticism, with a special interest in Finnish folklore. Zorn specialized in portraits, nudes and genre scenes, with a brilliant brushstroke of vibrant luminosity.. In Russia, Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin should be mentioned. Serov had a style similar to that of Manet or Renoir, with a taste for intense chromatism and light reflections, a bright light that extols the joy of life. Korovin painted both urban landscapes \u2014 Parisian street scenes \u2014 and natural landscapes \u2014 summer images in Crimea \u2014 in which he elevates a simple sketch of chromatic impression to the category of a work of art. In Spain, the work of Aureliano de Beruete and Dar\u00edo de Regoyos stands out. Beruete was a disciple of Carlos de Haes, so he was trained in the realist landscape, but assumed the impressionist technique after a period of training in France. An admirer of Velazquez's light, he knew how to apply it to the Castilian landscape \u2014 especially the mountains of Madrid \u2014 with his own personal style.

This was only a year after the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade, and 33 years before the first kafana was opened in Istanbul in 1555. There are no historical sources to why Belgrade was so important at the time to have such venue so early. Ottoman traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi visited Belgrade in 1661 and counted 21 khans and 6 caravanserais. The largest, Caravanserai of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had \"160 chimneys\", and some had harem sections. When Austrians conquered Belgrade in 1718, among other reports to the imperial court in Vienna, they sent a report on kafanas naming them: \"Crni orao\", \"Crveni petao\", \"Pet \u0161eva\", \"Tri zeca\", \"Divlji \u010dovek\", etc. They especially addressed the problematic \"Kod dve bule\", notorious favorite place of the \"debauched\" Baron Franz von der Trenck.Belgrade remained rich in kafanas in this period as there were almost 200 kafanas and meyhanas, so production of alcoholic beverages in the city bloomed to meet the demand. Austrian governor, Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, was known for his love of the night life. He abolished all taxes on drink serving, and business blossomed. There were some 140 kafanas and pubs in the German section of the city, and over 200 in the Serbian sector. The former mostly served beer, and the latter wine and rakia. In the 1717-1723 period, four breweries were opened in Belgrade. Duke also organized balls in his palace. In the periods when the balls were organized, music in other parts of the city was forbidden. Common citizens were sometimes forcefully dragged to the balls. where they had to pay the entry fee of 17 kreuzers, which was too high. The aristocracy mostly used the commoners as a laughingstock at the balls, and those who refused to come or made problems at the balls, were jailed and whipped. A massive, lush dinners and feasts, known as traktacije, were organized. They included meals out of reach for the common people, like caviar, octopuses, salted herrings, fried pigeons, hot chocolate or imported wines.

The building was constructed in the first half of the 17th century and served as caravanserai (khan) at least since 1658. Popular venue stayed in business until the early 1960s.

This continued after the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, until the new assembly building was finished in 1936. Also hosted performances of the National Theatre in Belgrade until 1920.. 1896 - first public motion picture show in Serbia held in \"Zlatni krst\", on Terazije, on 6 June 1896, with Lumi\u00e8re brothers personally showing the film.

Same thing happened few years later with the elementary school \"Jovan Cviji\u0107\" and the \"Lavadinovi\u0107\" kafana.. 1910s - members of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia, including Gavrilo Princip, gathered in the \"Zlatna Moruna\" and planned their actions, including the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, used by Austro-Hungary as the pretext for World War I.. in time, various neighborhoods of Belgrade or important buildings, were named after the kafanas: Zeleni Venac, London, Lipov Lad, Mostar, Lion, \u010cukarica, Cvetko, Golf, Gospodarska Mehana, Dva Bela Goluba, Palace Albanija, Ruski Car, Mihajlovac, \u017dagubica, Park \"Tri klju\u010da\", etc.As of 2023, on the administrative territory of Belgrade, there were 18 former or still operational catering and tourist facilities which were declared cultural monuments: Modern nightlife. Prolonged dance evenings \"till dawn\" (igranke) were the precursors of modern nightlife after World War II. In the new, Communist regime, new types of music became almost obligatory, like the kozara\u010dko kolo, but in the period immediately following the Allied victory this music was mixed with Russian romances, jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. Western music especially became popular after the film Sun Valley Serenade with Glenn Miller's music reached Yugoslav cinemas. Dances included tango, waltz, foxtrot, slowfox, and especially popular trucking, or treskavac in Serbian (\"shaking dance\"). However, with political changes regime's attitude soon switched. By the end of 1945 the American music was labeled as \"capitalist fun which spoils our youth and leads into sexual and other pathologies\". Accused of undermining discipline and public moral, the trucking was officially banned in the early 1946. By 1951 the state propaganda attacked boogie-woogie (\"eccentric, vulgar and decadent\"), while entire public campaign was orchestrated in 1952 against jazz, which \"influenced the animal sensations\". This first post war period of dance nights lasted from 1945 to 1963.First night clubs, referred to as disko[teka] in Serbian, were opened in the second half of the 1960s as a result of the popularity of rock and roll. First rock and roll news can be found in press already in 1956. Public reaction lacked the disputes and rage of the previous types of music, like jazz or contemporary dance in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It appeared that the older generations didn't perceive rock and roll, nor the accompanying way of dancing or dressing as a problem, so the reaction was cold and indifferent. By this time, Yugoslavia was more open to foreign influences compared to other Communist states, citizens freely travelled abroad, and no one stopped creation of numerous rock bands, called vokalno-instrumentalni sastavi, or VIS (\"vocal-instrumental band\").At first, the penetration of rock and roll was slow, but in time gained momentum so the media couldn't ignore it. One of the pioneer promoters was Nikola Karaklaji\u0107, chess master and editor at Radio Belgrade. His TV show Concert for crazy young people was the most popular."}]}, "correct": false}

Prostitution was largely suppressed by the actions of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, founded in 1903.At the turn of the 19th and the 20th century, Belgrade had one hospitality or catering venue per 50 inhabitants. After World War I, new venues were completely westernized. New hotels, with popular restaurants, were \"Splendid\", \"Astorija\", \"Union\", \"Luksor\", \"Palace\", etc. The social divide remained, though. Members of the lower classes couldn't afford fancy venues, like hotels \"Slavija\" or \"Imperijal\", to order Wiener schnitzel or Hungarian goulash, to listen to German or French singers or to watch magicians, jugglers and other artists. They were visiting small cookshops, soup kitchens and lowest quality venues. Among the most luxurious and exclusive nightlife locales during the Interbellum was \"Srpski Kralj\", at the corner of Uzun-Mirkova and Pariska streets.

The new building, located across the Kalemegdan Park, today hosts the Belgrade City Library. It was part of the colloquially styled \"Kalemegdan group of hotels\", due to their location. The venues began to develop after 1867 and full withdrawal of the Ottomans from the city. The group included the \"Nacional\" inn, later also a hotel, built in 1868. \"Srpska kruna\" architecturally preserved the appearance of the khan - squared, central inner yard - but in modern style.
