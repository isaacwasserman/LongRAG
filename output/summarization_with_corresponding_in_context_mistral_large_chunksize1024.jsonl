They opted for a steel polyhedron case and mounted the painting on a distant wall to avoid reflection issues. The display was well-received by some, but others had reservations. In 1992, the painting was moved to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. Picardo, elected to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1997, gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores in 2000 and was awarded the Premio Antonio Camu\u00f1as de Arquitectura in 2001. His contributions to architecture have been recognized for their thoughtful integration of historical heritage.", "text": "The architects' problem was that, while the painting is 7.76 metres long by 3.49 metres high, the largest sheet of 18mm triple armoured glass available at that time was smaller, at 7.50 metres by 2.45 metres. The decision was therefore made to install the painting some distance away from the main sheet of glass, so that the metal frame of the glass would not infringe on the view of the image. The solution for the display was to build an armoured glass and steel polyhedron case whose bevels, for full security, would meet the floor, the walls and the ceiling around the picture. The main glass itself was set at 10 degrees to the vertical to avoid reflections. The sources of illumination would be within the case. The size of the room in which the picture was displayed \u2014 a large high space originally created as a ballroom \u2014 allowed the whole canvas to be viewed from 25 metres away.Guernica was installed in September 1981 and the room opened to the public on 25 October that year, Picasso's centenary. Within a year, over one million people had seen Guernica in its new Picardo/de Paredes setting. Opinions of the method of display differed. The artist's daughter, Paloma Picasso, applauded the location and the method of display, as did Spanish artist Josep Renau. Catalan architect, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, described it as \"magnificent\". The British art critic and collector, Douglas Cooper, wrote that the painting was \"admirably lit, there being no shadows, no reflections and no distortions.\" He went on: \"Never in its history has Guernica been displayed so beautifully or so entirely to its advantage.\" Others were not so convinced. It was reported that the fact the installation was built by the technicians of the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes rather than by the Prado's own staff brought practical difficulties. And British art critic, David Sylvester, maintained years later that when Guernica was returned to Spain in 1981 \"it was hung in an annexe to the Prado, where by common consent it was not seen to advantage.\"In 1992 Guernica was controversially moved from the Museo Nacional del Prado (where Picasso had wanted the painting to be permanently displayed) to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. The Picardo/Garc\u00eda de Paredes display installation is no longer in use. Election to the Real Academia. On 3 February 1997, at the age of 78, Picardo was elected Academician of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), being proposed by Julio Cano Lasso, Fernando Chueca Goitia and Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. He entered the Academy on 22 February 1998 with a speech entitled Hip\u00f3lito, the composition and delivering of an address having been established as one of the requirements after being elected Academician. In it he talked of two of his passions: architecture and the horse. \"The horse is an animal that surpasses the human body in beauty, strength and speed,\" Picardo claimed. \"... and architecture, in turn, is the art that protects this human body and enables and exalts it.\" He confessed that it was impossible for him to decide between architectural beauty and equine beauty because both \"son perfecciones\" (are perfections).In 2000 Picardo gifted the academy his oil painting Guardia civil en el puerto de Alazores, an image of five policemen mounted on five horses in a compact group. The academy observes the complicated juego (game) of the twenty horses' legs of different colours and in different positions seemingly almost entwined.The academy also houses in its collection a portrait of Picardo by Luis Garc\u00eda-Ochoa Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. Painted in 1953 it portrays Picardo in an informal pose at the age of 34. It was donated to the academy by his sons in 2023. Premio Antonio Camu\u00f1as de Arquitectura.

The castle, built in the 13th century, had been abandoned and was in disrepair. Picardo decided to build the Parador on the site of the old barracks and stables, rather than in the castle itself, to take advantage of the views and avoid altering the castle's original structure. The first phase of the Parador, completed in 1965, included a dining room, lounge, service areas, and 7 double guest rooms, with additional rooms and facilities added in later phases. Picardo designed the building to resemble the castle, using modern materials hidden beneath traditional stone, brick, timber, and iron. He also added 24 guest rooms in a westward extension in 1973, bringing the total to 43 and elevating the building to the title of Parador. The interior was designed to continue the medieval ambiance, with furniture, wall-hangings, and other details created by Picardo.", "text": "He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda. The castle stands on the site of a Moorish fortress and was built in the mid-13th century. It was damaged both in the frontier wars between Moors and Christians and in the Castilian Civil Wars. During the Peninsular War it housed Napoleonic troops. By the time Picardo came to the castle it had been completely abandoned. The site is on the top of a steep hill 800 metres above the city, with views in all directions.. Picardo began work on the Parador in early 1963 and his draft plans were ready by the late summer of that year. The building was planned as a simple hoster\u00eda with the emphasis on refreshment rather than accommodation, and was built on the location of the old barracks and stables of the castle rather than in the castle building itself. Picardo wanted large windows so visitors could enjoy the views; building in the castle would either mean making substantial openings in the original walls or building above the height of the battlements. Neither idea was acceptable to him.Using the elongated site at the top of the hill, Picardo planned a dining room, a lounge, service accommodation and guest rooms. He styled his new building on the layout and dimensions of the old castle and on what had been discovered during his research of its surviving interior designs. Work started in 1963, and the Parador opened to guests on 11 September 1965.The first phase, built only as a hoster\u00eda, had on the first floor 7 double guest rooms with fireplaces and with wooden balconies of a design that Picardo would repeat in a number of his later Parador designs. A mezzanine floor housed a cafeter\u00eda and a bar with an outside terrace, and on the ground floor was the reception area, the lounge and the restaurant, together with the service areas. There were also four single rooms for drivers, and a mechanical workshop.Picardo's Parador at Ja\u00e9n was a pastiche, which paid homage to the neighbouring castle. The basic structure was 20th-century concrete, steel, block and cement but he completely hid it from the public gaze with stone, brick, timber and iron in a way that suggested age and implied that the cladding materials formed the entire construction. The 20 metres high vault of the lounge appears to be built entirely of brick, but the structural impression is false; the Parador's admiring guests are not aware of the modern supporting skeleton behind the brick. Also much admired are the six impressively large and lofty stone arches in the dining room, which appear to support the ceiling and roof and achieve \"una sensaci\u00f3n espacial espectacular\" (a spectacular spatial sensation), but are in fact hiding the room's steel frame.In a second phase in 1969 Picardo added service rooms on the south wall, allowing the old service area to be converted into a further 12 guest rooms.In the late 1960s and early 1970s excessive rain caused a number of landslips in the unstable ground around the castle and hoster\u00eda and Picardo was regularly called in to strengthen the building.. Picardo returned to the project in 1973 to build a further extension in the same style. This was erected to the west of the first building and was joined to it by a tower which allowed for a change of heights between the original building and the new one. 24 guest rooms were added by the new extension, on two floors, bringing the total to 43. Picardo was hampered by the layout of the available land, and by limitations in the height to which he could build, so the extension elongated the building in a way that produced long corridors and distances between bedrooms and public areas. With the opening of Picardo's extension, the building was elevated to the title of Parador. It was inaugurated in 1978.Picardo also designed the building's interior, producing furniture, wall-hangings, shutters, carpets, light fittings, door furniture, floor and wall tile patterns and so on to continue emphasising the building's medieval ambience. He also used coats of arms from demolished buildings for both the interior and exterior of the Parador."}, {"summary_score": 0.8857213780246959, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8610030946941833, "text_rank": 10, "summary": "Picardo, the architect known for his work on Paradores, improved the castle-turned-Parador in Ciudad Rodrigo in 1975.

Despite contemporary criticism, his Paradores, such as those in Ja\u00e9n, Carmona, and Sig\u00fcenza, remain popular. Besides Paradores, Picardo also restored various historical buildings, including Catedral de C\u00e1diz, Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana, Palacio de Gamazo, Castillo de San Felipe, and Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca.", "text": "In 1975 he also developed improvements for one of the earliest existing Paradores, opened in 1929, the castle at Ciudad Rodrigo in the Province of Salamanca in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Controversial legacy of Picardo's Paradores. It was not unusual in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s for the rehabilitation of castles and convents (not all destined to be Paradores) to be carried out without archeological research either before work began, which would have added to expense and delayed the project, or while work was being carried out. Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo's work at Sig\u00fcenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects' objective as being escenograf\u00eda convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached \u2014 Picardo's Parador at J\u00e4en is a good example \u2014 she has described them as being \"falso hist\u00f3rico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo's defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art). Picardo himself maintained: \"El Arte es eterno ...\"(Art is eternal ...), \"...it is always current. The reconstructions of the castles are really false. If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo's artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\" He goes on to say that faced with the dilemma of adopting a \"mimetic and conservative attitude or a more modern and disruptive approach\", Picardo claimed supremacy for Art. \"En Arte todo es posible\" (In Art everything is possible), wrote Picardo in 1994. \"A good architect will know how to weigh up both solutions and his sensitivity shall dictate his choice.\"Despite the current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores \u2014 particularly those at J\u00e4en, Carmona and Sig\u00fcenza \u2014 though pastiche, remain amongst the most popular of the network's hotels. One United States travel writer enthused about J\u00e4en: \"I love this parador, so dramatic in its setting, so theatrically conceived ... Inside, the deception is masterly, creating an ambience as old and austere as it is surrealistic and extravagant.\" Other historical restorations. Demonstrating his educated and precise knowledge of classical styles, during his career Picardo carried out restoration works on the Catedral de C\u00e1diz, deleteriously affected by salt from being near the sea, the Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, the Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, damaged during the Civil War, and in the tiny Ermita del Humilladero in the Sierra de Villuercas. He rehabilitated the Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana (also known as Palacio Domecq) in Jerez, rebuilt the Palacio de Gamazo in Madrid which had been partially demolished three years before, restored the Castillo de San Felipe in Puerto de la Cruz de Tenerife and in his last project worked on the Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca in the old centre of the city in 1995.

Other Parador projects. In the 1960s and 1970s Picardo was called upon by the Ministry of Information and Tourism to investigate and report on a number of other old buildings for possible conversion into Paradores. He drew up proposals and plans for a number of these buildings but, despite detailed work on some of them, they did not become Paradores within his working life or were completed by other architects. Picardo was also asked to review proposed works for similar buildings to be restored by other architects, and to develop ideas for improvements to existing Paradores.. Among the most advanced plans Picardo drew up were in 1969 for the renovation and conversion into a Parador of the castle at Puebla de Alcocer, a small municipality 70 miles east of M\u00e9rida in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura. His draft plans show that a multitude of openings would have to have been made in the outside walls for windows. An access road was built, but ultimately the project did not materialise.Another project, in 1970, was the conversion into a Parador of the 11th century remains of the castle in Monz\u00f3n, in the Province of Huesca in Aragon, but Picardo judged the project to be unviable and the idea was abandoned by 1972.Among other buildings Picardo reported on were three for which he executed preliminary designs and drawings and which later became Paradores, though he was not involved in their completion. They were, in 1963, the old palace at Olite in Navarra, in March 1969 the Castillo de la Zuda at Tortosa in the Province of Tarragona in Catalu\u00f1a and in 1970 the castle at Cardona in the Province of Barcelona in Catalu\u00f1a.Picardo also surveyed several other buildings which were ultimately destined not to become Paradores. Among them were the Castillo de San Ant\u00f3n at A Coru\u00f1a in 1968, the Posada del Cord\u00f3n at Atienza in the province of Guadalajara in 1969, in 1970 the Palacio del De\u00e1n and the Palacio del Dr Trujillo at Plasencia in the Province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura, and in 1971 the Castillo de Segunto near Valencia.

His eleven Parador masterworks encouraged other Spanish architects to work in the same vein, and Portuguese architects, too, in the similar state-run chain of hotels in Portugal, the Pousadas de Portugal. Picardo's work for Paradores de Turismo is highly regarded by other professionals, and also by hotel guests who revel in the historical imagery and romance of his work. Parador de Guadalupe: Zurbar\u00e1n. For his first of many Parador projects Picardo was appointed by the Ministry of Information and Tourism in July 1963 to convert into a Parador two ancient neighbouring buildings in the village of Guadalupe in the province of C\u00e1ceres in Extremadura. One building was the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, also known as the Hospital de Hombres, which was built in the mid-14th-century, rebuilt in 1402 and refurbished in the 16th century. The other building was the Colegio de Infantes, also known as the Colegio de Gram\u00e1tica, built in the early 16th-century for the education of  boys. They were situated close to the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, one of the most important monasteries of medieval Spain, in the centre of the village. The college was included in the Cat\u00e1logo de Monumentos Nacionales (Catalogue of National Monuments) when Guadalupe was declared a conjunto monument urban de inter\u00e9s nacional hist\u00f3rico-artistico (monumental urban complex of national historic-artistic interest).Picardo found the two buildings to be in a ruinous state, housing humble dwellings and poor workshops. While constructing a hotel out of the buildings, his task was to save what remained of their basic structures, including an \"outstanding\" staircase, and to return them to their original Mud\u00e9jar style. He partly demolished the old structures of both buildings, rebuilding them as they had originally looked, using ancient Mud\u00e9jar  construction techniques based on lime, clay and wood.Picardo set the main hospitality section of the Parador within the Colegio de Infantes, adding to the external south side of the cloister to provide a dining room and, above it, terraces for guest rooms facing the garden. The cloister remained intact, with Picardo leaving the lower arches open, but closing the upper ones with glass and wooden latticework. The exposed wooden framework and coffered ceilings were respected and clay tile flooring was laid on the upper floor.. The Hospital de San Juan Bautista was remodelled for the hotel's kitchens, service areas, laundry, staff residences, and car parking. Picardo also designed a large first floor breakfast room on the street side of the hospital building. Ventilation for all the services and rooms throughout the Parador was provided by chimneys which were covered with Arabic tiles and whitewashed uprights perforated with starry latticework and topped with glazed ceramic tiles in white, blue and green.Most of the furniture and internal decoration was designed by Picardo and he made much use of decorative wall tiles produced by the ceramicist Juan Manuel Arroyo Ruiz de Luna, including some explaining the history of the buildings, signed by Picardo. He was to employ Arroyo repeatedly in his Parador projects over the following twenty years and as a result the ceramicist's work became an identifying feature of Picardo's work.Restoration at Guadalupe started in November 1963 and the hotel, with twenty double rooms, opened on 11 December 1965.In 1981 Picardo was invited back to Guadalupe to add a new wing of guest rooms. He built them in understated but similar style to the rest of the Parador, providing views of the rooftops and towers of the monastery and of the surrounding mountains. The new wing increased the number of guest rooms to 41. As a result of being an afterthought to the original design, access to the new wing was complicated and required an abundance of staircases and lifts. Parador de Ja\u00e9n: Castillo de Santa Catalina. At the same time as preparing his restoration at Guadalupe, Picardo was commissioned by the Ministry to design and build a Parador at the Castillo de Santa Catalina (Castle of Santa Catalina) in Ja\u00e9n in Andaluc\u00eda."}]}}

Instead, Picardo's rebuilding projects were planned mostly on the basis of his own historical and architectural research. The hotel conversions and the demolition of large parts of monumental buildings without detailed investigation and record-keeping was somewhat frowned upon in the 1960s and 1970s, and over half a century later is seen by archeologists and historians as a matter of significant controversy and regret. Picardo's work at Sig\u00fcenza, in particular, converting a castle-palace into a Parador, has been decried as \"medieval scenery for tourist accommodation\".The leading researcher into the architectural history of the Paradores network and its restoration of architectural heritage, Dr Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, has extensively documented and studied the work of Picardo and his fellow Paradores architects of the 1960s and 1970s in her lengthy and detailed doctoral thesis and subsequent books and publications. She has described the architects' objective as being escenograf\u00eda convincente (convincing set design) to evoke the historical era considered to be of interest to tourists, generally the medieval period. In writing of the new extensions which were designed to be identical to the monuments to which they were attached \u2014 Picardo's Parador at J\u00e4en is a good example \u2014 she has described them as being \"falso hist\u00f3rico\" (false history) ... \"a replica whose documentary value has been masked or even lost\".In Picardo's defence, his early mentor Fernando Choeca Goitia defined him as \"un arquitecto sue entiende la arquitectura como arte\" (an architect who understands architecture as art). Picardo himself maintained: \"El Arte es eterno ...\"(Art is eternal ...), \"...it is always current. The reconstructions of the castles are really false. If they are Art, they are justified and if they are not, they are truly condemnable.\" Picardo had no qualms about his film set concept of restoration, using modern construction techniques and concealing them with traditional materials, as long as the buildings looked old rather than modern. One Spanish academic, an assistant professor of architecture and design, writing of Picardo's artistry, has stated: \"The end ... justified the means, in such a way that in his work we can find an impressive rib vault supported by a hidden metallic substructure, a coffered ceiling suspended from a concrete slab or a stone retaining wall with a reinforced concrete core.\" He goes on to say that faced with the dilemma of adopting a \"mimetic and conservative attitude or a more modern and disruptive approach\", Picardo claimed supremacy for Art. \"En Arte todo es posible\" (In Art everything is possible), wrote Picardo in 1994. \"A good architect will know how to weigh up both solutions and his sensitivity shall dictate his choice.\"Despite the current views of historians, Picardo's Paradores \u2014 particularly those at J\u00e4en, Carmona and Sig\u00fcenza \u2014 though pastiche, remain amongst the most popular of the network's hotels. One United States travel writer enthused about J\u00e4en: \"I love this parador, so dramatic in its setting, so theatrically conceived ... Inside, the deception is masterly, creating an ambience as old and austere as it is surrealistic and extravagant.\" Other historical restorations. Demonstrating his educated and precise knowledge of classical styles, during his career Picardo carried out restoration works on the Catedral de C\u00e1diz, deleteriously affected by salt from being near the sea, the Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, the Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda de Sig\u00fcenza, damaged during the Civil War, and in the tiny Ermita del Humilladero in the Sierra de Villuercas. He rehabilitated the Antiguo Palacio del Marqu\u00e9s de Montana (also known as Palacio Domecq) in Jerez, rebuilt the Palacio de Gamazo in Madrid which had been partially demolished three years before, restored the Castillo de San Felipe in Puerto de la Cruz de Tenerife and in his last project worked on the Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Salamanca in the old centre of the city in 1995.

With much imagination he personalised the characters he portrayed, for instance rendering the King of Hearts as the Emperor Charlemagne, the King of Clubs as Goliath, the King of Diamonds as Julius Caesar and the King of Clubs as Alexander the Great. They were produced in colour by the Spanish firm Naipes Heraclio Fournier and surviving packs are much in demand by collectors. Another games design produced by Picardo at much the same time was a set of wooden chess pieces formed in tall, slender, conical shapes and, with the exception of the pawns, surmounted by intricate and delicate indications of the pieces' types.

From the early 1960s to 1985 Picardo dedicated much of his professional life to the state-run hotel chain, Paradores de Turismo de Espa\u00f1a. He had for some time carried out minor work for the Ministerio de Informaci\u00f3n y Turismo which controlled the hotel network. For the purposes of tourism the Ministry and its forebears had for over 30 years rehabilitated rundown and sometimes ruined historic buildings such as castles and convents and converted them into luxury hotels in a style that went beyond ordinary hotel use. In the early 1960s, as Spanish tourism increased, the Ministry decided to rapidly expand its Parador operation (which would within a decade grow from 40 to 83 establishments) and Picardo, with his previous experience of historical restoration and his abiding interest in historical and vernacular buildings, was seen by the Ministry be a suitable architect to take on much of this type of work.. Picardo began working for Paradores on a series of restorations of old, monumental buildings and sometimes building new establishments adjacent to ruined monuments in a style that faithfully copied their original designs. His hybrid conversions maintained and often embellished the monuments' ancient appearance while at the same time finding inspiration in them for the style of luxurious modern hotel arrangements the authorities required.. A wealth of Picardo's drawings for his Paradores projects survive. There are large collections of extensively detailed plans which cover his designs from whole Paradores to the smallest detail of door furniture. There are axonometric before-and-after drawings of the buildings and the landscapes around them. There are bird's eye views exercising his mastery of perspective and his spatial vision. They all show meticulous skill.For nearly twenty years, from the early 1960s to his last work for the Paradores in the 1980s, Picardo carried out eleven major reconstructions of historical buildings and/or erected sympathetic and imitative new constructions abutting them or rising from their ruined foundations.

This interest in historical architecture shaped Picardo's work throughout his career.", "text": "Early life. Picardo was born in Jerez de la Frontera, in the Province of C\u00e1diz in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain on 18 June 1919. His father was Alvaro Picardo de Celis and his mother's family name was Castell\u00f3n. He had four brothers, one of whom died in infancy. His father died in 1929 when Picardo was ten years old. With his mother and his brothers he moved to Madrid, Spain. He enrolled at the newly created Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes for his high school education. On completing school he initially wanted to join the navy, but was frustrated by the closure of the military academies in Madrid during the Second Spanish Republic. He turned to the study of law, but was frustrated again, this time by the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 when he was in the middle of his course. He had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. Training in architecture. To avoid being evacuated from Madrid when the Spanish Civil War began, Picardo joined the studio of the architect Luis Moya Blanco, a professor 15 years his senior at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid (Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid). Impressed by Picardo's abilities, Moya Blanco encouraged Picardo to abandon law and take up a career in architecture.. The Civil War and the dictatorial regime that followed it resulted in fewer architects in Spain. Some of those who had prospered during the Republic did not survive the war. Others had gone into exile or had been professionally disqualified. Under decree by the dictator Francisco Franco the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aquitectura (General Directorate of Architecture) was set up to control architecture in Spain and collaborate in what his regime called la reconstrucci\u00f3n nacional (national reconstruction). Many architects were required to be subordinate to it. Against this background, in 1945 Picardo entered the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid.From the beginning of Picardo's studies, his abilities in painting and drawing \u2014 in particular his mastery of perspective \u2014 drew him to the attention of a number of architects who praised him highly. While he was still a student, architects commissioned murals from him for the interiors of their buildings, and employed him within their practices for the graphic representations and perspectives of their plans. Picardo executed his first professional mural painting at the age of 20 in 1939 in the Cine F\u00edgaro (Figaro Cinema) in Madrid, commissioned by his architecture mentor Luis Moya Blanco. The painting of murals was the main source of income for Picardo during his youth and early career.As a student Picardo also began to illustrate many articles and later several covers for the Spanish architectural magazines Revista Nacional de Arquitectura and the Bolet\u00edn de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Arquitectura. His drawings in these publications have been described as showing \"increasing sophistication\" and being of \"complexity and extraordinary quality\". Particularly noted in his post-student days were illustrations portraying Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and sketches of the Canarias (Canary Islands) in 1953. He also showed a growing interest in historic architecture, in particular its preservation and restoration. Picardo completed his training by making increasingly numerous travels to study buildings around Spain and abroad. His investigative journeys around the Iberian Peninsula awakened in him an intense interest in its historical and vernacular architecture. He was described as an \"outstanding\" student. Early career. Architect. On qualifying in 1951, Picardo pursued his interest in historical architecture by collaborating on a number of building preservation and restoration projects with the Spanish architect and architectural historian Fernando Chueca Goitia, who was 8 years his senior. Chueca's appeal to Picardo was the older man's lengthy research into what he saw as the unchanging elements of Spanish architecture that maintained their constancy despite political and religious changes. Picardo was one of the 24 signatories of the ''Manifiesto de la Alhambra'' of 1952, described as one of \u201cthe most remarkable texts in the histiography of 20th-century Spanish architecture\", of which Chueca was the main instigator. The manifesto collected the reflections of a group of architects (Picardo among them) and \"sought inspiration in the design\" of the Alhambra in Granada, Andaluc\u00eda for \"a distinctively Spanish form of modern architecture\". This inspiration was to guide much of Picardo's work throughout his career."}]}}

Eixample (7.46 km\u00b2, 263,565 inhabitants): this district arose from the expansion of the old city after the demolition of the walls, thanks to the Cerd\u00e1 Plan drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. It is a densely populated district, since in its beginnings it was mainly a residential area where wealthy families stayed after leaving the old part of the city. The social level, however, has stabilized, and today corresponds mainly to the middle class. Even so, it is an important focus of tourist attraction, especially due to the presence of modernist architectural works, which has encouraged trade and the installation in the area of major commercial brands..

Historical evolution. The administrative division has varied over time. The first delimitation was established in 1389, when the city was divided into four quarters: Framenors, Pi, Mar and Sant Pere. This division was made by establishing a grid with the Pla\u00e7a del Blat as the geometric center, with the separation of the northern and southern quarters set in the ancient Roman cardo maximus. This separation already showed the social difference between the different parts of the city: Framenors was an aristocratic neighborhood, Pi was residential and civil service, Sant Pere was industrial and commercial, and Mar was popular and religious, since it housed most of the convents and monasteries. In the 15th century, another quarter, Raval, was added, establishing a division that lasted until the 18th century.In 1769 a reform was made by which five quarters were created, each subdivided into eight neighborhoods: I-Palacio included the port and the new neighborhood of Barceloneta; II-San Pedro was an eminently industrial area; III-Audiencia corresponded to the center of the city; IV-Casa de la Ciudad was a mostly residential area; and V-Raval included the land west of La Rambla.Numerous divisions were made in the 19th century, most of them for political reasons, since the districts also marked the electoral districts."}]}}

Policies to promote affordable housing were also carried out, and in Eixample the recovery of the block courtyards as green areas or public services was sought.In 1988 the Pla Especial de Clavegueram de Barcelona (Special Sewerage Plan of Barcelona) (PECB) was approved, which remodeled the network of coastal sewers, eliminating practically half of the city's flood areas, while promoting the construction of breakwaters, which allowed the recovery of the city's beaches. The same purpose was served by the 1997 Pla Especial de Clavegueram de Barcelona (Special Sewerage Plan for Barcelona) (PECLAB), which boosted stormwater regulation reservoirs to prevent flooding.The arrival of democracy favored the creation of new green areas in the city. At this time gardening was closely linked to urban planning, with a concept that combined aesthetics with functionality, as well as recreational aspects, sports facilities and services for certain groups such as children or the elderly, as well as areas for dogs.

The planning of the Olympic Village was complex, and several aspects had to be adapted: the coastal railroad had to be buried; sewage treatment plants had to be built and the wastewater that had previously gone directly into the sea had to be channeled; a new port (Olympic Port) was built; new beaches were established and regenerated; and new road and transport axes were laid out, such as Avinguda d'Ic\u00e0ria."}]}}

In this period Barcelona and Catalonia became part of the Hispanic Monarchy, which arose from the dynastic union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon. It was a time of alternation between periods of prosperity and economic crisis, especially due to plague epidemics in the sixteenth century and social and military conflicts such as the Reapers' War and the War of Succession between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, although in the latter century the economy rebounded thanks to the opening of trade with America and the beginning of the textile industry.

In the first half of the 16th century, the sea wall was built, where the bastions of Llevant, Torre Nova, Sant Ramon and Migdia were placed. Otherwise, the main urban reform was in the area around the cathedral, where the Pla\u00e7a de la Seu was opened, in front of the main portal of the cathedral (1546), as well as the Pla\u00e7a de San Iu, with a space cut out of the Grand Royal Palace.. During the 15th and 16th centuries, an artificial port was built to finally meet the needs of the important mercantile center that was Barcelona: paradoxically, during the period of splendor of Catalan trade in the Mediterranean, Barcelona did not have a port prepared for the port volume that was common in the city. The old port at the foot of Montju\u00efc had been abandoned, and the city had only the beach to receive passengers and goods. Deep-draught ships had to unload by means of boats and rope lads (bastaixos). Finally, in 1438, royal permission was obtained to build a port: first, a ship loaded with stones was sunk to serve as a base for the wall that connected the beach to the island of Maians; the wall was reinforced in 1477 and lengthened in the form of a breakwater in 1484. In the mid-16th century, the port was enlarged in response to the campaign launched by Charles I against Tunisia. At the end of the century, the quay had a length of 180 m by 12 m wide.With the construction of the port, the seafront between Pla de Palau and La Rambla was embanked, thus urbanizing the Passeig del Mar, now Passeig de Colom. At this time the water supply and sewage system was also improved, and for its maintenance the figure of the mestre de les fonts (\"master of the fountains\") was instituted, in charge of the care of mines, fountains and gutters.In the 17th century, the city wall was extended again with the construction of five new gates (Sant Sever, Tallers, Sant Antoni, Sant Pau and Santa Madrona, the latter a reconstruction of the 14th century one). Streets were also paved, sewers were installed, drinking water fountains were built and improvement works were carried out in the port.. In the eighteenth century the Principality of Catalonia and Barcelona itself saw much of its autonomy truncated with the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession: the Nueva Planta Decree (1716) eliminated the Generalitat, the Corts and the Consell de Cent, which were replaced by a military government, and the municipal jurisdiction was reduced to the city, losing the area of influence that the Consell de Cent had in the metropolitan area."}, {"summary_score": 0.8474493393425885, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8459679137588259, "text_rank": 6, "summary": "During the 18th century, Barcelona experienced urban development with paved streets, installed sewers, and built drinking water fountains.

In this period there was a great economic revitalization, linked primarily to the textile industry, which in turn led to a Catalan cultural renaissance. Between 1854 and 1859, the city walls were demolished, allowing the city to expand, under a project called the Eixample, drawn up by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 in 1859. After the revolution of 1868, the Citadel was also demolished and the land transformed into a public park. The population grew, especially thanks to immigration from the rest of Spain, reaching 400,000 inhabitants by the end of the century.Although chintz printing was well established in Barcelona since the 18th century, the industrial era proper began with the founding in 1832 of the Bonaplata Factory, founded by Josep Bonaplata. In 1849 the complex La Espa\u00f1a Industrial, owned by the Muntadas brothers, was opened in Sants. The textile industry grew steadily until a crisis in 1861, caused by the shortage of cotton due to the American Civil War. The metallurgical industry was also gaining importance, boosted by the creation of the railroad and steam navigation. In 1836 the Nueva Vulcano foundry opened in La Barceloneta and, in 1841, La Barcelonesa began, one of the predecessors of La Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima (1855), one of the most important factories in the history of Barcelona.Industrialization brought about important changes in the urban planning of the city, due to the new needs of the economic sectors of the capitalist system, which required a strong concentration of labor and auxiliary services. Barcelona thus underwent an important leap to modernity, characterized by three factors: the population migration from the countryside to the city, the link between industrial and urban developments, and a better articulation of the territory through a wide network of roads and railroads, which will lead Barcelona to become a colonizing metropolis of its territorial environment.. During this century, the municipal ordinances that began with the Edicto de obrer\u00eda (Workmen's Edict) were consolidated: in 1814, the Preg\u00f3n de polic\u00eda urbana (Proclamation of Urban Police) established in 84 articles all the provisions on civil building, maintenance of public spaces and various regulations on security and public order. In 1839, the Bando general de buen gobierno (General Good Governance Charter) renewed and expanded these provisions and, among other things, regulated the relationship between the width of streets and the height of buildings. On the other hand, the law of January 8, 1845 established the City Council's own attributions in various aspects such as urban planning, regulating the sanitary conditions of public spaces, as well as the conditioning of streets, squares and markets. In 1856 the first Ordenanzas Municipales (Municipal Ordinances) were approved, which brought together and expanded previous provisions, within an urban code that contemplated for the first time all aspects of civic and institutional relations in the city. For the first time, building permits were required to include an interior layout plan. These ordinances soon became obsolete due to the new Eixample plan, until in 1891 new ones were drawn up that took into account the new specificities of the expansion and new links in the city. Among other things, the area of occupation of the plots was increased from 50% \u2014established in the Cerd\u00e0 Plan of 1859\u2014 to 70%.Among the main urban planning actions of these years were the opening of Calle de Fernando (Ferran) in 1827, between La Rambla and the Plaza de San Jaime (Sant Jaume), with a later continuation towards the Borne with the streets of Jaime I (Jaume I) (1849\u201353) and Princesa (1853). In 1833 the expansion of the Pla de Palau began, which was then the nerve center of the city, with the presence of the Royal Palace, the Llotja and the Aduana."}]}}

Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major.

The new section was 5100 m long and covered an area of 1.5 km\u00b2. The enclosure had eighty towers and eight new gates, among which were several enclaves of relevance today, such as the Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, the Portaferrissa or La Boqueria. A network of fortifications was also built in the urban periphery for the defense of the city, such as the castle of the Port, in Montju\u00efc; those of Martorell and Castellv\u00ed de Rosanes, at the entrance of the Llobregat river; those of Erampruny\u00e0 (Gav\u00e0) and Castelldefels in the delta of the same river; and that of Montcada at the entrance of the Bes\u00f2s river.The medieval urban fabric was marked by different areas of influence, from the aristocracy and institutional power, through the bishopric and religious orders, to the guilds and the various trade associations. The network of streets was irregular, and the squares were mere widenings of the streets, or plots of land derived from the demolition of a house, which were usually used to store wheat, wool or coal. The houses were usually of the \"artisan type\", with a first floor for the workshop and one or two floors for living, generally measuring 4 m wide and 10\u201312 m deep, sometimes with a small vegetable garden at the back. The larger buildings were either churches or palaces, along with some institutional buildings, such as the Casa de la Ciutat, seat of the Consell de Cent \u2014later City Hall\u2014 or the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, seat of the homonymous political institution of the Principality, as well as a hospital \u2014such as the Santa Creu\u2014 or buildings such as the Llotja or the Drassanes.. In 1209, one of the first private urban planning operations in the city took place, the opening of Montcada street, thanks to the concession made by Peter II to Guillem Ramon de Montcada; a wide, straight street was laid out, running from the B\u00f2ria to the sea, and was occupied by large stately residences. Another of the few urban planning processes of this period was the opening of the Pla\u00e7a Nova, next to the Episcopal Palace and near the cathedral of Barcelona, carried out in 1355 thanks to the demolition of several houses and the reuse of the Bishop's orchard.Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the continuous urban growth led to a new extension of the walled enclosure, with the construction of the Raval wall, in the western part of the city, which covered an area of 218 ha, with a perimeter of 6 km. The new urban enclosure started at the Drassanes, following the current ring roads of Sant Pau, Sant Antoni, Universitat and Sant Pere, going down the current Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys to the monastery of Santa Clara \u2014in the current Citadel Park\u2014, and to the sea, along the current Avinguda Marqu\u00e8s del l'Argentera. Currently only the Portal de Santa Madrona, in the Drassanes, is still preserved.With the extension of the wall, a long avenue known as La Rambla, occupied mainly by religious institutions, was left within the city walls. It was then proceeded to its urbanization, which was completed in 1444. In its day it was the widest space in the city, dedicated to strolling, leisure or the installation of occasional markets. Deeply reformed between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, today it is one of the most emblematic places of the city.Finally, it is worth noting that during the Middle Ages an extensive network of roads emerged in the plain of Barcelona that connected the city with the various suburbs and villages in the vicinity, as well as other points of interest: farmhouses (Melina tower road), mills (Verneda road), quarries (Creu dels Molers road), bleaching meadows (Teulat road), churches or chapels (Sant Ll\u00e0tzer road), fountains (Font dels Ocellets road), etc."}]}}

Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire.

From the end of the century it is worth mentioning Pere Garcia F\u00e0ria's project to regulate the city's sewage system (Proyecto de saneamiento del subsuelo de Barcelona: alcantarillado, drenaje, residuos urbanos, 1891). It was a project that placed special emphasis on hygienism, with innovative criteria that are still in force today: it established a visitable sewerage network, 80 cm wide by 170 cm high, maintained by a municipal brigade that still performs its functions. It is a unitary system for rainwater and wastewater, which works mainly by gravity \u2014except for a few small pumping stations\u2014 making it necessary to have large collectors in the lower part of the city. Thanks to this project, the sewerage network was extended in a few years from 31.2 km to 212 km. Around this time, the streets also began to be urbanized with tiled sidewalks and cobblestone roadways, replaced in the 1960s by asphalt.It should also be noted that during the nineteenth century the increase in population and new industrial needs led to an increase in water consumption, which required a larger water collection and distribution network. Thus, at the end of the century a new pipeline was built from Dosrius (Maresme), with a 17 km gallery and a 37 km aqueduct that brought water to the city. The first marketing companies appeared then, the main one of which was the Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona (AGBAR), created in 1882.On the other hand, the increase in population between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the creation of new hospitals to serve the population of the new districts of the city: the Hospital Cl\u00ednico y Provincial (1895-1906) and the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (1902-1930), a monumental modernist-style complex designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. Later, the hospitals of Esperan\u00e7a (1924), the Red Cross (1924), the Military (1924) and the Hospital del Mar (1931) were created, while in 1955 the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, one of the main health referents of Catalonia, was inaugurated.During these years the Eixample was progressively urbanized, first thanks to private initiative and the so-called Sociedades de Fomento (Development societies), and from 1892 with the appearance of the Comisiones Especiales de Ensanche (Special Commissions for the Eixample) arising from the new Eixample Law of 1892. This law was based on the Law of Forced Expropriation of 1879, and developed a management system with public and private participation. The urbanization process used to have several phases: filling the area, parceling the land, installation of services such as sewerage, running water and lighting, and construction of buildings.

Socially, this century saw the massive arrival of immigration to the city, with the consequent increase in population: if in 1900 there were 530 000 inhabitants, in 1930 they had almost doubled (1 009 000 hab), to reach between 1970 and 1980 the maximum peak (1 754 900) and by the end of the century to 1 500 000 inhabitants.With the turn of the century, a new political scenario opened up, marked by the loss of the colonies in America and Asia and the rise of the Regionalist League, led by politicians such as Francesc Camb\u00f3, Enric Prat de la Riba and the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who expressed their desire to place Barcelona on the international front line, at the level of cities such as Paris, New York, Berlin or Vienna. It is the model of the \"Imperial Barcelona\" proposed by Prat de la Riba, or the \"Nova Par\u00eds del Migdia\" (New Paris of the Midday) commented by Puig i Cadafalch."}]}}

Expansion of Barcelona (Eixample). In the middle of the century a transcendental event took place that completely changed the physiognomy of the city; the demolition of the walls. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the population grew steadily (from 34,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the eighteenth century to 160,000 in the mid-nineteenth century), which led to an alarming increase in population density (850 inhabitants per hectare), endangering the health of the citizens. However, due to its status as a stronghold, the central government opposed the demolition of the walls. A strong popular outcry began, led by Pedro Felipe Monlau, who in 1841 published the memoir \u00a1Abajo las murallas! (Down with the walls!) in which he defended their destruction to prevent diseases and epidemics. Finally, in 1854, permission was granted for their demolition, which gave the way out for the territorial expansion of the city.In 1859 the City Council appointed a commission to promote a competition for urban expansion projects, which was won by Antoni Rovira i Trias; however, the Ministry of Development intervened and imposed the project of Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, author of a topographic plan of the Barcelona plain and a demographic and urbanistic study of the city (1855). The Cerd\u00e0 Plan (Plan de los alrededores de la ciudad de Barcelona y del proyecto para su mejora y ampliaci\u00f3n, 1859) instituted an orthogonal layout between Montjuic and the Bes\u00f2s, with a system of straight northwest-southeast oriented streets, 20 meters wide, cut by other southwest-northeast oriented streets parallel to the coast and the Collserola mountain range. Cerd\u00e0 had planned to build on only two sides and leave the other spaces for gardens, although this point was not fulfilled and finally practically all the buildable land was used; the buildings were designed with an octagonal floor plan characteristic of the Eixample, with chamfers that favored circulation. The plan called for the construction of several main avenues: Diagonal, Meridiana, Paral\u00b7lel, Gran Via and Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as several large squares at their intersections: Tetuan, Gl\u00f2ries, Espanya, Verdaguer, Letamendi and Universitat. It also foresaw the opening of three large avenues in the old part of the city: two that would connect the Eixample with the coast (Muntaner and Pau Claris) and another perpendicular one that would connect the Citadel with Montjuic (avenida de la Catedral). It also contemplated a series of new ring roads that would circumvent the old city, in the place left by the walls: the ring roads of San Pablo, San Antonio, Universitat and Sant Pere.. Cerd\u00e1's project was quite innovative for the time, especially with regard to the delimitation of green spaces and service areas, taking into account both functional, recreational and welfare aspects. The buildings were to have a height of 16 meters (first floor and four floors), and a depth of 10 to 20 meters. The distribution of the Eixample was to be in sectors of 20 x 20 blocks, divided into districts of 10 x 10 and neighborhoods of 5 x 5. Each neighborhood was to have a church, a civic center, a school, a day care center, a nursing home and other welfare centers, while each district was to have a market and each sector a park.

Instead, uncontrolled housing construction and real estate speculation during the Franco dictatorship led to urban sprawl, unplanned neighborhoods, and the use of cheap materials. The growth of suburbs resulted in the integration of neighboring municipalities and the coining of the term \"Great Barcelona.\" Real estate speculation was facilitated by the 1942 Municipal Ordinances reform, which increased building heights in relation to street widths, causing significant differences between buildings and disfiguring the urban space. The Regional Plan of 1953 aimed to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities, meet housing demand, curb real estate speculation, and improve the urban environment, but encountered difficulties in its application.

This increase in buildability caused notable differences between buildings constructed at different times, and led to the presence of numerous party walls that disfigured the urban space, a problem that the city still suffers from despite several projects to remedy it, such as the Barcelona posa't guapa (Barcelona, make yourself pretty) campaign.The post-war urban renewal was led by the head of urban planning of the new authorities, Pedro Bidagor, who in 1945 promoted the creation of the Barcelona Provincial Planning Commission, responsible for drawing up a planning project for the city and its surroundings. Thus arose the Regional Plan of 1953, developed by Josep Soteras, an attempt to integrate the city with neighboring municipalities in order to meet the strong demand for housing in the years of massive immigration, while trying to curb real estate speculation and improve the urban environment. The Plan was accompanied by a legislative change, the Land and Urban Planning Law of 1956, which sought to bring rationality to urban development, although it encountered numerous difficulties in its application. The project differentiated between zones of urban expansion, suburban or garden cities, applying a polarized distribution of the territory; thus, in Barcelona it identified three zones as areas of growth: Levante, Poniente and Diagonal Norte. It also reserved large areas for infrastructure, facilities and green spaces; among the latter, it emphasized the enclosure of the Collserola mountain range as a large central metropolitan park.Although it was not carried out in its entirety, various \"partial plans\" emerged from its initial approach, most of which yielded to the pressures of the land owners and tended towards the requalification of land: a 1971 study calculated a 1.8 multiplication of the population density of the partial plans with respect to the Comarcal of 1953. The most relevant were those referring to the two ends of the Diagonal avenue, east and west: in the first the new neighborhoods of La Verneda and Bes\u00f2s were created, while in the second the Zona Universitaria was projected and the neighborhoods of Les Corts and Collblanc were enlarged.. The growth of the population and the appearance of new neighborhoods implied the construction of new markets for the supply of basic products: Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (1944), Carme (1950), Sagrera (1950), Horta (1951), Vallvidrera (1953), Estrella (1954), Guinard\u00f3 (1954), Tres Torres (1958), Bon Pastor (1960), Montserrat (1960), Merc\u00e8 (1961), Corts (1961), Guineueta (1965), Ciutat Meridiana (1966), Felip II (1966), Sant Mart\u00ed (1966), Bes\u00f2s (1968), Sant Gervasi (1968), Carmel (1969), Vall d'Hebr\u00f3n (1969), Port (1973), Proven\u00e7als (1974), Lesseps (1974), Trinitat (1977) and Canyelles (1987).During these years, automobile traffic increased considerably, which led to the improvement of the city's road network: Meridiana Avenue was opened, the First Ring Road (Ronda del Mig) was built and the Second Ring Road was planned, the construction of subway parking lots was started and the freeway network was extended thanks to the 1962 arterial network project, with a set of radial highways starting from Barcelona in several axes (Vall\u00e8s, Llobregat, Maresme)."}]}}

Barcelona, capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levant, on the Mediterranean coast. Its geographical location is between 41\u00b016' and 41\u00b030' north latitude and between 1\u00b054' and 2\u00b018' east longitude. With an area of 102.16 km\u00b2, it is situated on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Collserola mountain range \u2014with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point\u2014, as well as by the deltas of the Bes\u00f3s and Llobregat rivers. Above the coastline and separating the city from the Llobregat delta is the mountain of Montju\u00efc (184.8 m). Also, from the Collserola mountain range, several hills that follow a line parallel to the coastal range rise up on the plain: the hills of La Peira (133 m), La Rovira (261 m), El Carmel (267 m), Creueta del Coll (249 m), El Putget (181 m) and Monterols (121 m).The plain of Barcelona is not uniform, but has several undulations caused by the many torrents that once crossed the land, and also has a uniform slope from the sea to the Collserola mountain range, with an ascent of about 260 m. It is crossed by several faults, mainly the one that separates the Collserola mountain range from the hills that come forward in the plain, with a northeast-southwest orientation, and the one that separates the mountain of Montjuic from the coast. The terrain is formed by a substrate of slate and granitic formations, as well as clays and limestones. The coast was formerly occupied by tidal marshes and salt-water lagoons, which disappeared as the coastline advanced thanks to the sediments provided by the rivers and streams that flowed into the beach; it is estimated that since the sixth century BC, the coastline has been able to advance about 5 km. The area of the plain was formerly crossed by numerous torrents and streams, which were grouped into three fluvial sectors: Horta stream in the area near the Bes\u00f2s river (or eastern area); the Blanca stream and the Gornal torrent in the Llobregat area (or western area); and, in the central area of the plain, a group of streams coming from the southern slope of Tibidabo, such as the San Gervasi, Vallcarca, Mag\u00f2ria and Collserola streams.The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters thanks to the protection that the orography of the terrain offers to the plain, which is sheltered from the north winds. The temperature usually ranges between 9.5 \u00b0C and 24.3 \u00b0C, on average. Rainfall is low, about 600 mm per year, and most of the precipitation occurs in spring and autumn. This scarcity meant that in the past numerous works had to be carried out to supply water to the city, including wells, canals and irrigation ditches. The vegetation of the area consists mainly of pines and evergreen oaks, and undergrowth of heather, laurestine, arbutus and climbing plants.

The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea."}]}}

Similarly, some neighborhood units were not satisfied with their aspirations to become neighborhoods, such as Can Caralleu, Penitents, Torre Melina or El Polvor\u00ed. The ancient city. Barcelona was founded by Roman colonizers in the first century BC with the name of Barcino. Originally, it was a small walled city which took the urban form of castrum initially, and later oppidum, seated on the Mons Taber (16.9 meters above sea level), a small hill located on the site of the current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume. The maximum splendor of the Roman period took place during the second century, with a population that must have ranged between 3500 and 5000 inhabitants.The main reason for the choice of a small promontory near the coast to build the city was its natural harbor, although the alluvium of the torrents and the sedimentation of sand from the coastal currents would make the port's draught difficult. The center of the city was the forum, the central square dedicated to public life and business. It was located at the confluence of the cardus maximus (Llibreteria and Call streets) and the decumanus maximus (Bisbe, Ciutat and Regomir streets), approximately in the center of the walled enclosure. From this center, the city followed an orthogonal layout, with square or rectangular blocks, following a grid layout based on two main axes: a horizontal axial order (northwest-southwest) and a vertical one (southeast-northeast), which would mark the future layout of the city, and would be collected by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1 in his Plan de Eixample of 1859.The Romans were great experts in architecture and civil engineering, and provided the territory with roads, bridges, aqueducts and an urban design with a rational layout and basic services, such as sewerage. The enclosure of Barcino was walled, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, which protected a space of 10.4 ha. The first wall of the city, of simple construction, began to be built in the first century B.C. It had few towers, only in the corners and at the gates of the walled perimeter. However, the first incursions by Franks and Alemanni from the 250s onwards made it necessary to reinforce the walls, which were enlarged in the 4th century. The new wall was built on the foundations of the first, and consisted of a double wall of 2 meters, with a space in the middle filled with stone and mortar. The wall consisted of 74 towers about 18 meters high, most of which were rectangular in base.Of the rest of the urban elements preserved from the Roman period, it is worth mentioning the necropolis, a group of tombs located outside the walled area, in the current Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Madrid: it has more than 70 tombs from the second and third centuries, discovered by chance in 1954. There are also remains of two aqueducts that carried water to the city, one of them from the Collserola mountain range, to the northwest, and another from the north, taking water from the Bes\u00f3s river; both joined in front of the decuman gate of the city \u2014currently the Pla\u00e7a Nova\u2014.After the fall of the Roman Empire and until the formation of the Catalan counties, there were several conquests and the passage of successive civilizations, from the Visigoths and Arabs to a period of integration into the Carolingian Empire.

The Jewish quarter, the Call, existed from 692 until its destruction in 1391, and was located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla, and Bisbe.", "text": "This period was marked by the reuse of the Roman city and the use of its urban structure, which did not undergo significant changes. A noteworthy aspect of this period is its consideration as a military stronghold, which will lead it to acquire hegemony over other surrounding cities and become the capital of its territory. The colonization of the surrounding countryside also began at this time, within a system of feudal structure, as well as a certain suburbanization began, with the appearance of the first suburbs. Middle Ages. At this time Barcelona was constituted as a county and later became part of the Crown of Aragon and the political and economic center of the Principality of Catalonia, becoming an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea. The city grew from the primitive urban core \u2014what is now the Gothic Quarter\u2014 and, in the 14th century, the Raval district emerged. Barcelona had about 25,000 inhabitants at that time.Medieval Barcelona arose from the reconstruction of the city after its near destruction by Almanzor in 985, starting again as the main nucleus of the structure and the wall from Roman times. The city underwent numerous changes as a center of political and religious power, a center of trade and craft production, and as the nexus of a new and complex network of social and institutional relations. Thus, the city acquired an autonomy of its own, a singularity within the surrounding territory, becoming the center of a hinterland that would mark the organization of the modern city.The progressive increase in the size of the city, and its increasing urban, social and economic complexity, led to the creation of a specific system of government for the administration of the city, the Council of One Hundred (1265). This entity operated in a field of action that went from Montcada to Molins de Rei, and from Castelldefels to Montgat. Among other things, it was responsible for the supply of food and water, the maintenance of roads, the census of the population and territorial demarcation. It also established the first urban building patterns, known as Consuetuds de Santacilia and promulgated by James I.. During medieval times Barcelona had a Jewish quarter, the Call, located between the current streets of Ferran, Banys Nous, Palla and Bisbe. Founded in 692, it survived until its destruction in 1391 in a xenophobic assault. It was separated from the rest of the city by a wall, and had two synagogues (Mayor, now a museum, and Menor, now the parish church of Sant Jaume), baths, schools and hospitals.Outside the city walls, the plain of Barcelona was devoted to agriculture, especially dedicated to supplying the city: it was known as the hort i vinyet de Barcelona (\"orchard and vineyard\"), which produced fruit, vegetables and wine, in an area between the streams of Horta and Sants, and between the Collserola mountain range, Puig Aguilar and Coll de Codines to the sea. This agricultural development was consolidated with the construction, in the middle of the 10th century \u2014and probably by Count Mir\u00f3\u2014 of two canals that directed the waters of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s rivers to the vicinity of the city: the Bes\u00f2s canal was known as Rec Comtal or Regomir, and was parallel to the Strata Francisca, a road that was a variant of the ancient Roman Via Augusta, and was built by the Franks to better bring the city closer to the center of the Carolingian Empire.Once the danger of Muslim incursions was over, the first settlements outside the city walls were established. Various population centers (vila nova) were created, generally around churches and monasteries: this was the case around the church of Santa Maria del Mar, where a neighborhood of port character was created; likewise around the church of Sant Cugat del Rec , of an agrarian character; the neighborhood of Sant Pere around Sant Pere de les Puelles; the neighborhood of El Pi arose around the church of Santa Maria del Pi; that of Santa Anna next to the church of the same name; the neighborhood of Arcs settled around the Portal del Bisbe; and the Mercadal, around the market of Portal Major. The Raval neighborhood (Catalan for \"suburb\"), initially a suburb populated by orchards and some religious buildings, such as the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp (914), the church of Sant Antoni Abat (1157), the convent of the Carmelites Cal\u00e7ats (1292), the priory of Nazareth (1342) or the monastery of Montalegre (1362), was also formed little by little.. The creation of these new neighborhoods made it necessary to extend the walled perimeter, so in 1260 a new wall was built from Sant Pere de les Puelles to the Drassanes, facing the sea."}]}}

The 1929 International Exposition in Montju\u00efc further urbanized the area and showcased noucentisme architecture.", "text": "The service was suppressed in 1908 due to protests from the tramway companies, for which it was clear competition, but in 1916 some suburban lines appeared, running between Barcelona and Sant Just Desvern, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Hospitalet, Badalona, El Prat, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Gav\u00e0 and Sant Climent de Llobregat. In 1922, city buses were reestablished, in charge of the Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Autobuses de Barcelona (General Bus Company of Barcelona, CGA), which was later absorbed by Tranv\u00edas de Barcelona, (Tramways of Barcelona) which went on to operate both transports.Also at this time the first taxis appeared: in 1910 the first 21 vehicles were licensed; in 1920 there were already a thousand taxis, with 64 stops throughout the city. In 1928 the green light was incorporated as a \"free\" signal, and in 1931 the color black and yellow was established as the city's distinguishing color.. In the 1920s, urban transport was improved with the construction of the Barcelona Metro. Work began in 1920 with the installation of two lines: line 3 (Lesseps-Liceo), inaugurated in 1924, and line 1 (Catalu\u00f1a-Bordeta), put into service in 1926. The network was progressively expanded, and today Barcelona has 12 lines. Initially it was operated by three companies: Gran Metropolitano de Barcelona (L3), Metropolitano Transversal (L1) and Ferrocarril de Sarri\u00e0 a Barcelona (now Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya); the first two merged in 1957 into the company Ferrocarril Metropolitano de Barcelona, which together with the bus company Transportes de Barcelona formed in 1979 the company Transportes Metropolitanos de Barcelona (TMB).It should also be noted that during the first decades of the century, public schooling was greatly boosted, thanks above all to the initiative of the City Council, the Provincial Deputation and the Commonwealth of Catalonia. In 1922, the City Council created the Patronat Escolar, which promoted secular, bilingual education and pedagogical renovation, and promoted an ambitious plan of school buildings, including those built in noucentista style by Josep Goday (Ramon Llull, Collaso i Gil, Llu\u00eds Vives, Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals, Baixeras and Pere Vila schools). After the Civil War, public education was taken over by the central government, until the arrival of democracy, when the competences were transferred to the Generalitat.In these years, increasing importance was also given to the question of green spaces, which was raised in 1926 by Nicolau Maria Rubi\u00f3 i Tudur\u00ed, director of the Parks and Gardens Service of Barcelona: with the text El problema de los espacios libres (The problem of open spaces), presented at the XI Congreso Nacional de Arquitectos (XI National Congress of Architects), he proposed the placement of a series of green spaces in the form of concentric semicircles between the Bes\u00f2s and Llobregat rivers, all along the Collserola mountain range, with small enclaves in the inner part of the city in the style of the London squares. He proposed four levels for the city: interior parks, among which would be the Citadel and Montju\u00efc, as well as three smaller ones (Letamendi, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and Gl\u00f2ries); suburban parks, among which would be the Hippodrome, Tur\u00f3 Park, Tur\u00f3 Gil, Font del Rac\u00f3, Vallcarca, Guinard\u00f3 and Park G\u00fcell; exterior parks (Llobregat, Pedralbes, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo, Sant Medir, Horta and Bes\u00f2s); and the Collserola nature reserve. Rubi\u00f3's project was not executed, except in small portions, but little by little the city was gaining green land: from 1910 to 1924 it went from 72 ha to 450 ha. 1929 International Exposition. In 1929 the International Exposition was held in Montju\u00efc. For this event the entire area of the Pla\u00e7a dEspanya, the avenue of Queen Maria Christina and the mountain of Montju\u00efc was urbanized, and the pavilions that currently house the Barcelona Fair were built. One of the main architects of the project was Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and it was one of the main test beds of noucentisme, the successor style to modernisme."}, {"summary_score": 0.8964099218917266, "summary_rank": 1, "text_score": 0.8839468283948686, "text_rank": 2, "summary": "In the mid-19th century, Barcelona underwent significant urban transformation, which included the introduction of the tramway for urban transport in 1872. Miquel Garriga i Roca and \u00c0ngel Baixeras presented plans to renovate the city's interior, with Baixeras' plan focusing on opening three major thoroughfares in the old city center. However, Garriga's project faced execution challenges, and Baixeras' plan was not realized until 1895 due to the absence of expropriation mechanisms.

Garriga's project foresaw the realignment of streets as the basic method of a broad renovation of the city's interior, but the difficulty of its execution and the absence of expropriation mechanisms paralyzed this first project.. A more elaborate project was carried out by \u00c0ngel Baixeras in 1878, who presented an expropriation bill to the Senate, which was approved in 1879. Baixeras' project envisaged a thorough remodeling of the old city, and its most outstanding aspect was the opening of three major thoroughfares \u2014initially called A, B and C\u2014 to make the old city center more walkable, following Cerd\u00e0's old project. However, the project was not approved until 1895, and it still had to wait until 1908 for its execution, partially realized, since only the A road, renamed V\u00eda Laietana, was built.It is also worth mentioning the introduction of the tramway for urban transport. In 1860 an omnibus line had been opened along La Rambla, but the slowness of the carriages made this means of transport not very viable. In 1872, rails were laid for its traction, which lightened the transport, with imperial model cars \u2014of English origin\u2014, pulled by two or four horses. The line was extended from the port (Drassanes) to the village of Gracia, and later from the Drassanes to La Barceloneta. One of the first lines to operate was the English Barcelona Tramways Company Limited. In 1899 the streetcars were electrified.. During these years, street furniture also grew, especially since the appointment in 1871 of Antoni Rovira i Trias as head of Buildings and Ornamentation of the City Council, as well as his successor, Pere Falqu\u00e9s, who made a special effort to combine aesthetics and functionality for this type of urban adornments. The increase of elements such as lampposts, fountains, benches, kiosks, railings, planters, mailboxes and other public services was favored by the rise of the iron industry, which allowed their mass production and resulted in greater strength and durability.. In the 1880s the installation of electric lighting began, which gradually replaced the gas lighting on public roads. In 1882 the first street lamps were placed in the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, and between 1887 and 1888 La Rambla and Passeig de Colom were electrified. However, the generalization of electric light did not take place until the beginning of the 20th century, with the invention of the light bulb, and it was not completed until 1929.Another service that emerged at the end of the century was the telephone. The first telephone communication in the whole peninsula took place in Barcelona, in 1877, between the Montjuic castle and the fortress of the Citadel \u2014in the process of dismantling but still housing a garrison\u2014. That same year the first interurban transmission between Barcelona and Girona was carried out by the company Dalmau i Fills, pioneer in the installation of lines in Barcelona. In 1884 the state monopoly of the service was established, but two years later the company Sociedad General de Tel\u00e9fonos de Barcelona (General Telephone Society of Barcelona) was authorized to operate it, which was later absorbed by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Peninsular de Tel\u00e9fonos (Peninsular Telephone Company). In 1925 the service was nationalized by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Telef\u00f3nica Nacional de Espa\u00f1a (National Telephone Company of Spain) was created. In 1897 there were 2479 telephones in the city, a figure that grew progressively: in 1917 there were about 10 .00, in 1930 26 .00, in 1960 200 .00, in 1985 750 .00 and in 2000 there were 850 .00 telephones.It should also be noted that in the last third of the century numerous supply markets were built, many of them made of iron, a fashionable element in the architecture of the time."}]}}
